<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth report of the committee for 1995 relating to an increased army presence in the north, APIN, stage 2.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In 1989 the Public Works Committee recommended the construction of facilities for the relocation to Darwin of the Second Cavalry Regiment, a reconnaissance unit which had been located at Holsworthy, New South Wales. The Defence Force structure review, which was announced in 1991, determined that a regular army brigade would be permanently based in Darwin by the end of the decade. This was to be achieved by the staged relocation of southern based units to the Darwin area. APIN is part of the overall Defence move to the north which encompasses the activities of the three services. APIN is not about the defence of Darwin; it is about the defence of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992 the committee tabled a report recommending the construction of facilities for units relocating to Darwin under stage 1. The report, which I have tabled, recommends the provision of suitable working, training and accommodation facilities for army units relocating to Darwin under APIN stage 2 at an estimated outturn cost of $264 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there are no Defence facilities in Darwin of suitable size, function or location capable of meeting the requirements of a brigade sized force. A need therefore exists to construct additional facilities at Robertson Barracks and to construct additional ammunition storage facilities at Marrara Swamp, RAAF base, Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to concerns expressed at the public hearing concerning the storage of ammunition at Marrara Swamp, RAAF base, Darwin, the committee notes that all storage is in accordance with the United Nations hazardous goods classification procedures and NATO safety principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue raised at the public hearing concerned the payment of subcontractors. The committee therefore recommends that the Department of Defence continues to include in its contracts a clause stating that subcontractors must be paid before progress payments are made to contractors. The committee was impressed with the willingness of the Department of Defence to hold discussions with contractors and to conduct seminars explaining how business is conducted with the department. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In speaking to the report, I specifically want to refer to recommendation 4 concerning the payment of subcontractors. The Public Works Committee has now adopted, as a formal arrangement, the asking of its contractors or its clients to ensure that the tender document has this inclusion. So far, we have had a remarkable acceptance of this principle from the departments concerned. I believe that the committee hopes this does form a precedent, particularly not only with references to the PWC but wherever the Commonwealth does work of this nature; where contractors and subcontractors are involved, this too might be part of the tender process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) on this matter, and I believe that he concurs with this. I believe that I speak on behalf of the committee when I say it would be a great idea if this could be accepted right throughout the Commonwealth contract area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years I know there has been&mdash;in my state, and I believe in New South Wales right along&mdash;a considerable amount of debate on contractors not paying subcontractual payments. This has been continuing right throughout, with some of the states promising that they will either, through trust arrangements or other protective legislation, do something to protect subcontractors. But, to my knowledge, I do not believe protection has eventuated in Australia, except perhaps in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would make the stipulation that there are precedents right across the nation, there are precedents internationally&mdash;Canadian precedents, I understand&mdash;but there is need to make sure there is more protection of subcontractors. The problem, of course, is getting the state legislation in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand also that for the Commonwealth this would not be a difficult arrangement because the client, which is the Commonwealth, has the cash. To make that a stipulation within the contract just means that the person paying the cash makes sure those subcontractors are paid. So that is relatively easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Administrative Services whether, perhaps at his state ministers conference, this matter might be further explored with at least a condition that the states' contracts also include a reference to payment of subcontractors. Some would think this would not be necessary, but I have had a case given to me within the last week of a subcontractor working with a contractor for the housing department in Queensland where the contractor has not paid the subcontractual arrangements. Yet that contractor is allowed to tender on other jobs because of his lower tender. It is alarming to know that this is still happening in an area in which state governments are involved, and I believe it could happen in areas in which the Commonwealth is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister whether he could see a means by which he could ask his state ministers to make sure the public works committees in those states opt for similar conditions and also try to widen the issue so that state legislation is introduced eventually to protect small business subcontractual enterprises, because I believe this is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join in this debate to also recommend the project which I believe, as a northerner, is well overdue. Protection of the north means protection of the rest of Australia. In this regard I pay tribute to the witnesses we had. Their submission was first-class and they gave an indication that they are very much on top of their jobs. I think they will be a very welcome presence in the north. That goes for those of us who live on the east coast of the continent and also in the north itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I endorse the report of the Public Works Committee and also congratulate the committee on its work under the chairmanship of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I was privileged to accompany the committee on part of its tour around Darwin in relation to APIN stage 2. It carried its duties out with a great deal of professionalism and dedication and asked appropriate questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse the remarks made by both of the previous speakers in relation to the issue of subcontracting. The point I make, which has been made already by my friend the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), is that the role of the defence forces in terms of their presence in northern Australia is one which is accepted and endorsed by the community. The Defence Force personnel offer a great deal to the Northern Territory community in particular in this instance. I endorse the remarks made by him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make is that the commitment the government has made, and which has been endorsed by the committee in this case, will cost until 2002 around $268.3 million. That is part of $561.1 million announced in the recent budget for either work under way or work to be undertaken between now and 2002. That is a very strong indication of the strength of the government's commitment to the move of defence forces to northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that needs to be emphasised is not only the role this expenditure has in underpinning the Northern Territory economy, both in terms of the construction industry and the work which has obviously been taken out through these capital works programs and the multipliers that flow from that, but also the multipliers that flow from the wages which are being paid to Defence Force personnel upon their arrival in northern Australia and the costs of running those Defence Force establishments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those things mean a great deal to the Northern Territory as they are helping to sustain very low levels of unemployment, particularly in Darwin, and they also mean that small businesses are thriving. That is the commitment which has been made as a result of these Defence Force expenditures by this government. I thank the committee for its work, its diligence and its dedication, and thank all those associated with the construction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The presentation of these sales tax bills enables me to raise a particular issue in relation to an exemption from sales tax which was brought to my notice by a constituent over two years ago. The government has not responded, and has been deficient in its attention to the problem that this constituent has. It is a problem for relatively few people in Australia. I would not know whether it would be a dozen or 20-odd, but it is a matter of great equity as far as the individuals are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter relates to the exemption of sales tax on vehicles purchased by those individuals who have a certificate from the secretary to the department that they are unable to use public transport in the pursuit of their employment. They therefore receive a sales tax exemption on the purchase of the vehicle in those circumstances. I will not use this particular constituent's name, for obvious reasons, but I will use some of the correspondence I have had with her in relation to this matter. In the first part of 1993 I was contacted by her and given the reply that she received in relation to her application for an exemption of sales tax on the purchase of a vehicle. The letter said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We refer to your application for sales tax exemption on a motor vehicle. We regret this delay in replying. Item 97 of schedule 1 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides exemption for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will go to subsection (3), which is the pertinent part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in this item `eligible disabled person' means a person who has a current certificate given by the secretary certifying that the person has lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent that he or she is unable to use public transport. `Secretary' means the secretary of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services or an officer authorised by that secretary.</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent has never had the use of arms because of the effects of thalidomide on her before she was born. She has no useful arms whatsoever. She has a driving licence, has passed advanced driving tests and is extremely adept. I asked for a demonstration from her and I am simply amazed at the capacity of this individual, who is fully employed, to drive a vehicle. The letter concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The certificate of medical eligibility issued by the Commonwealth Medical Office states that you have not lost the use of either or both legs to the extent that you are unable to use public transport. This means that you will not be able to obtain sales tax exemption on a motor vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA>This was quite clearly an unintended discrimination when the schedule was inserted in the legislation, I am sure, but I am finding that the government is quite solid on its resistance to moving in this matter. I approached the then Treasurer, the Hon. John Dawkins, in August 1993 and after his departure from this place I approached the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) a number of times and no action has ensued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent made a further approach to the department after the rejection I just read out. The pertinent part of the second response was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As your objection has not been made against an assessment or a disallowance or partial disallowance of a credit claim, your objection cannot be accepted as a valid objection. Nevertheless, we have reviewed your claim for exemption. Whilst we are sympathetic in respect of your situation, the act is quite explicit as to the type of disability a person must be suffering from before he or she is entitled to exemption under item 97. As has previously been advised, only persons who have been certified by the appropriate authority that have lost the use of one or both legs to such an extent they are permanently unable to use public transport for the use of transportation to and from gainful employment can claim exemption from sales tax on the purchase of a motor vehicle. As your disability does not involve the loss of one or both legs, we have no option but to confirm the earlier decision that you are unable to claim exemption from sales tax for the purchase of a motor vehicle under item 97.</PARA>
<PARA>Then followed further correspondence with the individual concerned who had been denied the exemption and medical certificates which quite clearly show that she does not have the use of arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the minister's response to this extremely unsatisfactory. Whilst it is not possible to extract, I find, statistics from the departments in each state to indicate how many people are involved or might be involved, I understand there are three in my own state. On some pro rata basis one can only assume that there might be a score of people around Australia. The minister's response has been, `She can get a disability payment and that will be equal to the exemption from sales tax in a given period of a purchase and retention of a vehicle.' My constituent says, `I do not want to get onto the social security train. I want to be equal to everyone else. I am earning my own living in full employment and I do not accept that I should go on a disability payment when people with a disability of the same severity or less severity are getting sales tax exemptions because of the loss of the use of legs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur entirely with that constituent. Why should she be on a lesser base in regard to this schedule than others? Why should she be discriminated against? The minister's negative response disappears entirely if he is talking about economics. He says that she can get a disability payment. He is not talking about saving any money. He cannot be. That is his answer to the people in similar circumstances. So he is saying, `I am not going to do it. I do not want to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to move an amendment during the passage of the bill through the consideration in detail stage and I will press it to a vote. I hope the minister will alter his view and will concede that on no ground whatsoever, on equity or money or finance, is there any reason but dogged persistence to his previous view that would induce him to vote against an amendment of this nature. I wanted to make those few remarks before we reached the consideration in detail stage. I see here a defect in the schedule, one that is practically demonstrated by others. I have had a phone call from one of the executive officer of ACROD supporting this move. I am sure that, if it were a widely known effect throughout the community, Australians generally would say that of course there is a question of equity and of course it should be remedied. This is the easiest way possible to do so at the presentation of these bills. I look forward to further discussion at the consideration in detail stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is a cruel and heartless attack on Labor's battling true believers. It is a pernicious and thoughtless attack on Australia's battling home builders and renovators, particularly young Australians. Finally, it is a callous attack on battling Australian workers. Despite all the denials that members opposite will make, this bill is a slug against the Aussie battler, and it is a fairly vicious slug too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tax increases will collect an extra $2 1/2 billion over the next four years&mdash;$2 1/2 billion, not an insignificant amount for dishonest increases. It makes a mockery of the claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> prior to the last election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>He said his tax cuts were law&mdash;l-a-w, law. He abandoned them. He told the people of Australia prior to the last election that they could have tax cuts without a GST. Well, they have got the GST, but the tax cuts have been abandoned. In fact, he has gone completely into reverse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister holds his esteemed office through fraudulent and deceptive conduct. He was elected to the office of Prime Minister through broken promises, deceit and misrepresentation. It was a prostitution of our democracy. He bought himself the prime ministership by offering tax cuts, promising not to put up tax and a plethora of bribes. Following the election, the tax cuts were abandoned, taxes went up and the bribes were forgotten. He turned the office of Prime Minister into a bidding game&mdash;he has prostituted it, and that is anathema to the principles of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills seek assent to the Labor Party's dishonesty. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) presented the budget in the expectation that the coalition, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Independents would support it; and thus support Labor's dishonesty. He should not be so ridiculous. If we supported any of these dishonest tax increases, it would send a clear message to the community that we do not mind such immoral, unprincipled and undemocratic behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we oppose dishonesty. We oppose the prostitution of our democracy. For that reason, we are opposing these tax increases. We oppose these bills. Whether the Democrats, Greens and Independents will support the legislation will indicate to the people of Australia their commitment to honesty and integrity and the principles underpinning our democracy. If the Democrats, Greens and Independents allow these tax increases to pass, they will tell the people of Australia that lying is fine and will call into question everything they say since they collude in dishonesty. If they oppose this bill, as they should, it will indicate they do uphold the principles of democracy and will not be party to Labor's dishonest attack on Australia's battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill increases the burden on Australia's battlers by increasing the sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to 21 per cent. On 1 July, it goes up to 22 per cent as a result of the Labor Party's 1993-94 budget of betrayal, which increased each tier of the wholesale sales tax by initially one per cent, and come 1 July another one per cent. This is but another broken promise. Remember the Prime Minister's One Nation speech in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From tomorrow, the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent . . .</PARA>
<PARA>You have to ask: if the sales tax were to be permanently lowered to 15 per cent, how permanent is permanent? If the Prime Minister said, `I will permanently tell the truth,' how would we interpret that? I would like to quote from a letter I received the other day from a Mr and Mrs Stokes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We entered into a binding contract to purchase our new motor vehicle from Titan Ford in Melville prior to any announcement of tax increase on 29 April 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After much research and consideration, we decided to purchase an Australian built vehicle in support of our own local economy, and not some foreign economy. This vehicle was yet to be built and we accepted the delay required to get our Australian built new car instead of a foreign import. We could in fact get delivery of a foreign import within days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have just been advised by the dealer that the new sales tax will apply to our new car, even though we had fully committed ourselves to the purchase (production number and all has been allocated).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the sales tax increase should not apply to us, as a firm order to purchase was placed prior to the announcement of any sales tax increase.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not infer any criticism of the company Titan Ford in Melville. It is a company with a very high reputation indeed. I wonder what the Stokes are supposed to do: go to the car dealers and say, `You better absorb the tax increase for it.' That was the ridiculous answer from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) last week when I asked a question along similar lines about increases in the cost of a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr and Mrs Stokes are not alone. There are many Australians who have been slugged with this dishonest tax. The facts are simple. When, before the last election, did the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, or any Labor spokesman say, `We will increase the sales tax on passenger motor vehicles'? When, before the last election, did anyone from the Labor Party seek endorsement for that? They did not seek endorsement, they did not get a mandate; and we will reflect the wishes of the Australian people and oppose this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Labor Party government says it is balancing the budget. As well as using shonky figures, it is based on dishonesty. While members opposite defend this budget by saying the tax increases are to balance it&mdash;they forget the assets sales will not be realised and therefore the budget will not be balanced&mdash;they ought to remember their excuses are useless because balancing the budget does not defend their dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Labor Party wants to balance the budget, it has to be scrupulously honest about it. It has to do it truthfully, and come out before the election and say, `We will balance the budget but it means increasing tax, it means abandoning tax cuts.' Then it can see whether it has a mandate. It is too honest to do that, and it will be thrown out for its dishonesty. </PARA>

Over four years this will increase government revenue by $49 million. Like the other measures in this bill, we will oppose the removal of this exemption. My concern on this issue is not just Labor's dishonesty but also the environmental aspect. In the present circumstances we must encourage the purchase of products which are a suitable alternative to products which in their manufacture are detrimental to the environment. I certainly hope this measure does not see increased consumption of non-recycled paper at the expense of recycled paper thus accelerating the destruction of our environment, no matter how small. </PARA>

Not one tree was felled for it, and I would like to see, if it is viable&mdash;Mica's report will certainly enlighten us further on this&mdash;greater development of industries which are an alternative to destroying our environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also intends to remove the sales tax exemption on building materials. This means the 12 per cent tax will apply to, to quote the explanatory memorandum, `builders' hardware; wall and floor tiles; plaster and plaster mixtures; taps, nozzles, tap handles and shower heads; bonding, setting and sealing agents; wooden floor coverings; paints, putties, fillers, thinners, pigments and driers; wallpaper; prefabricated household cupboards, cabinets and storage units and office partitions and workstation panelling.'</PARA>

This is the Treasury estimate. Building industries will collect over half a billion dollars and, quite frankly, I trust them more than I trust the boffins here in Canberra in their ivory towers, putting the tax through a computer simulation and working out what impact it will have on a house. Those boffins have predicted that, on a $100,000 house and land package, the impact on home buyers will be $400. The thing is, they do not build houses&mdash;they dream up broken promises. The builders, who know what goes into building a house, predict the impact will be at least $1,000. I notice in the press today that the government at last is coming slightly clean on that and getting a little closer to the mark. At the end of the day, it all depends on what goes into a house.

All he said was that the impact, according to Treasury, is only $400 and that, if builders charge more, home buyers should argue the tax with their builder. Who should the builder argue with&mdash;the supplier? The government increases the price but, according to the minister, home buyers should argue the tax with the builder. That comment is as fanciful as the minister believing he can win the seat of Brand. He knew he could not win Swan, but if he wants to stay here his only option is Fremantle.

We are all encouraged to buy our own homes to have for security and a place for our children to grow and call home.

What the Keating government has done is take up the very principles it said it would never take up and has applied them to the Australian community. The battlers are paying a greater proportion of their income to the government in a wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the 20 per cent sales tax level&mdash;where I would contend there has been a five per cent additional grab by the government in this budget&mdash;one finds that it applies to cleaning and chemical agents, such as glues, starches, disinfectants and insecticides. These are products used every day in every household, but the government does not concern itself with the way in which the battlers of Australia spend their money. The government said, `Here is a chance to tax something. We are going out for a one per cent tax increase'&mdash;but this increase in wholesale sales taxes is really a five per cent money grab from the battlers of Australia. It is the Keating sales tax&mdash;the KST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a one per cent increase on home entertainment, such as colour television sets and video cameras. But the biggest range of products and the greatest percentage increase in government revenue comes from daily-used household products, such as baby baths, cleaning sponges, baby bottles, all the toiletries and fittings in the bathroom, stationery, giftwrapping and ribbons. Even the tax on the dog's blanket is going to be increased. I cannot believe it. The government is going out into the dog kennel and finding things to tax. It is telling us that we are going to have to pay more for our pet dogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just cannot believe the way in which this government does things or the sheer hypocrisy and vindictive, hateful nature of the Prime Minister when he comes into the parliament espousing all the best things of Australia and then taxing those people who can afford it least&mdash;taxing them, taking a greater proportion of their salary and making it more and more difficult each week for them to live but saying, `We have a right to rule because we understand the Australian community.' Well, they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a sneaky hidden tax; it is an obscene and obscure tax. Nobody knows they are paying it. The government jacks up its share and the prices go up on the products on the shelves&mdash;and nobody knows why there has been a price rise. The Australian people should recognise that those price rises, which are occurring right now, are caused by the Australian government&mdash;the 10 per cent grab, the five per cent grab and the three per cent grab, just in those areas I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, we have the grab out of the cost of a car&mdash;an extra $1,000 for a new motorcar; and, on my estimation, we have approximately $700 to $2,000 on the cost of a new home. These contracts for cars and houses are written and agreed to by the buyer and by the person who is building or supplying the product. Where does the consumer go? The consumer has no alternative but to pay the price, and the person who is selling the product has no alternative but to increase the price to the consumer. Who sits back and cops no flak but, in a sneaky, secret and obscene way, grabs 10, five and three per cent more from all of these important ordinary household items?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government doing? Rubbishing the battlers. Not only is this wholesale sales tax a hidden, sneaky tax, but none of the rest of the world will tolerate it. The Keating sales tax that we have here in Australia is not used by other nations. When they have to pay the VAT in London, they hate it because it is up-front. But governments should have to be up-front. They should tell people how much they are collecting. People have a right to know where governments are getting their money from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not with this government. No, it prefers to keep things secret and hidden. It prefers to do secret deals with the unions and the big bosses&mdash;the Murdochs, Bonds, and that mob. It prefers to operate in secret behind closed doors. The taxation system in Australia is an exact reflection of the character of the government: the government takes secret, sneaky decisions, punishing the battlers and those who work and try hardest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is the sales tax, the Keating sales tax, a hidden and sneaky, secret taxation; it is also inflationary. It works this way, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I know that you are a man who is versed in these things; I have heard many erudite speeches from you on the tax system in Australia and I know that you understand: if a commodity costs $8, for instance, and there is a 20 per cent sales tax on it, it rises to $10. So the sales tax component is 20 per cent of the total cost. But that is the wholesale price. The wholesaler then on-sells it to the retailer, who takes it and puts it on his shelf. The product he bought for $10 he has to make a profit on, so he sells it for $15. He makes a profit of 50 per cent. But hidden in the $10 price he has paid is a 20 per cent Keating sales tax. What does he do? He puts his profit on top of a tax; he puts a 50 per cent profit on the 20 per cent sales tax. So instead of the price to me, to you and to the shoppers of Australia&mdash;the battlers of Australia&mdash;accurately representing a 20 per cent rise, it is much more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the example I have used, a $2 tax that the government receives becomes a $3 cost to the consumer, because there is a profit put on tax. It is a cumbersome, illogical and hopeless way of taxing. I have heard people call the Keating sales tax system a `ramshackle tax system'. So not only have we a hidden tax but it is building extra costs into our system, and they are costs that Australia does not need at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give the House some idea about how the government has moved on indirect taxes since it has been in office, I point out that sales tax revenue as part of its whole taxation collection has jumped from around 8.5 per cent in 1983-84 to a projected 11.4 per cent in the coming year. We have seen a big extra grab coming out of these indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister proclaimed at the last federal election, `We are not going to have a consumption tax,' but the government has increased the grab from indirect taxes by 30 per cent in the last three to four years. The government is unashamedly grabbing more from consumers and from sales in a way that it promised it would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the government grabbed more; it has not given back as it promised. It has secretly grabbed and has had to admit publicly that the l-a-w tax cuts everybody was promised were not going to be delivered.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an idea of the total tax regime and where the poor old pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, the one who pays every week, stands with this government, in 1983-84 the government collected about $24 billion from individuals. This year the government will collect $55 billion. The collections from all sources, including individuals, have gone up by 240 per cent in a 10-year period&mdash;a big spending government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the money going from an increase in total tax grab by 240 per cent and a 30 per cent increase in the grab from sales taxes in just a two- or three-year period? Has anybody seen the benefits in Australia for all this extra money being collected? We can see some interesting deals being done by the Prime Minister. We can see him flying around the world, criticising German architecture and giving away money here, there and everywhere. But the style of living for Australians has declined. Where has this money gone? There has been a 240 per cent increase in total tax take in the 12-year period the government has been in office, and inflation in that period has gone up by 60 per cent. The tax rises are not just matching a rise in the cost of living; it is far and above that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all of the splendour he can muster in his office, the Prime Minister proclaims that the government is a thoughtful, caring government&mdash;a government of the people. Of course, it is not because it is taking in the form of tax revenue, particularly through the Keating sales tax, from the people who can least afford it. A greater proportion of money is used and consumed by people on low incomes for daily needs. People with lower incomes spend a greater proportion of their income on day-to-day necessities than those with high incomes. They are the very people who will pay most with the Keating sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, and the government that the taxing of a wide range of business inputs makes sales tax an inefficient tax. It also imposes taxes on exports. You would not believe there would be a nation on earth that would actually tax a product before it left its shores to compete in a foreign market. But that is what Australia does. The Prime Minister has exacerbated that and said, `I will put a Keating sales tax on this, so exports will be even further penalised when we are right in the middle of an export drive.' Where is the logic in that? This is a crazy process. It is a mad way of balancing the budget or running government. As much as nine per cent&mdash;an average of five per cent&mdash;sales tax is imposed on our exports. </PARA>

The battlers in your area are coming to you, no doubt, and saying, `Look what they have done to the cost of my home.' You know how difficult it is for young people to get into a home. Even if they can get into a home, the minimum cost of most homes is $95,000 to $100,000 and they have to borrow most of that. Interest rates at the moment might be stabilising a little. Who knows?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this legislation which is another example of how this budget has increased the tax take from ordinary Australians. We should be reflecting now on the last federal election and on the deceit that was used by the federal Labor government to get itself re-elected at the time. We should cast our memories back to some of the things that the government was saying then about sales tax and the prospects of the implementation of a goods and services tax and the like. Here we have basically a goods and services tax on people's homes. There are no two ways about that. This is not a widespread reform of taxation to allow people to have tax cuts to be able to make a choice at the election. It is a straight out slug, an increase in the tax take, as part of the 1995-96 budgetary measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few observations about the general increase in tax take from ordinary Australians because it is pertinent to this legislation. I am indebted to my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the Second Deputy Speaker, who has made a fine contribution to this House. I believe he will continue to make a fine contribution to this House after the next federal election, notwithstanding the fact that his preselection was taken away by the Senator Crichton-Browne faction in the Liberal Party. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would probably say it is irrelevant. It is amazing how the relevancy rule is stretched a little when it suits those opposite. The honourable member for Curtin has made a tremendous contribution in taxation legislation debates and always makes what I consider to be detailed contributions in making sure that the public is fully aware of exactly how much money is being ripped off them by the Keating Labor government. He has pointed out that the total tax take since 1983 has risen by 190 per cent under Labor. This is made up of individual tax rising by 136.8 per cent, total company tax rising by a massive 370 per cent, total indirect tax by 149.8 per cent and sales tax by 305.7 per cent&mdash;making up for a total increase in tax revenue of 189.8 per cent, which is close to 190 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are constantly being told by the Labor Party that we are blessed to live in a country that is a low taxing country. Yet, quite frankly, nowadays very few people in this country believe that particular statistic that is bandied about continuously by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) every time there is a taxation debate in this place and elsewhere. One thing of interest&mdash;because it is going to come down to these sales tax changes&mdash;is the very high level of compliance costs that are foisted on taxpayers within Australia. In fact, we are probably at the top of the compliance cost tables of the industrialised nations of the world. Probably only the United States outstrips Australia as having higher compliance costs or compliance costs that are anywhere near as high as those in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn now to the sales tax increases that have slugged what we consider to be the battlers of Australia. I represent an outer suburban mortgage belt seat. My electorate contains the city of Wanneroo. The city of Wanneroo is now the fastest growing municipality in the country. It recently tipped the shire of Albert in the home state of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). As far as growth, demand and the infrastructure requirements of what we consider to be average Australians are concerned, the city of Wanneroo is at the grinding edge. Why is this so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the key elements of this budget, focusing on, in particular, the sales tax changes which we are specifically debating today. We have seen an increase in the Medicare levy. That will obviously hit those&mdash;those whom we consider to be the average Australians&mdash;on PAYE tax pay arrangements. It will particularly hit those people in my electorate because I have a large number of people with dual incomes coming into the household. I might say that dual incomes are not some sort of luxurious arrangements. Dual incomes are required in households to be able to service the high mortgages, particularly since the increase in interest rates in recent times, and there will now be more pressure on them because of the changes to the sales tax arrangements. So many people are going to find themselves paying more not only because of the increase in the Medicare levy but also because there are two incomes coming into a household. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect has been the change to the sales tax arrangements on passenger motor vehicles. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, many families rely heavily on the motor vehicle. Whatever we might say about public transport systems, particularly in metropolitan areas, there is no doubt that many require a motor vehicle in order to go to and come home from work&mdash;in other words, to be able to derive an income so they can pay for all the things they need to pay for, such as shelter and food for their families. Because my constituents live in the fastest growing area in Australia and because we are at the northern end of the urban sprawl in the Perth metropolitan area, quite naturally my constituents rely very heavily on either public transport or a motor vehicle to travel to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who know the Perth metropolitan area will know that it is a very large area. I think it is not much smaller than the Sydney metropolitan area in its total distances between the extremities. In the northern extremity of the Perth metropolitan area we have a situation where, notwithstanding the fact that there have been some improvements in public transport, the majority of people work out of the area&mdash;many of them work in the city centre&mdash;and, therefore, are forced to rely very heavily on their own resources to provide their own transport to get back and forth to work. That means that the increase in sales tax on passenger motor vehicles is going to hit them hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might argue that many of them probably buy second-hand motor vehicles. That is probably true. Many of the houses in my electorate need two motor vehicles, because often there are two people in the household who need to go backwards and forwards to their place of employment. Therefore, this tax hits them twice as hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, anybody who argues that this would not have any carry-on or pass-on effect to second-hand passenger motor vehicles is being less than truthful. Quite clearly, we all know that, with an increase in the price of new motor vehicles, the price of second-hand motor vehicles rises accordingly. It is a well-known market effect. It is quite logical and understandable. This means, notwithstanding the increases in fuel, the increases in stamp duty and all the other increases that have been foisted on ordinary household expenditure, we have yet another increase&mdash;the passenger motor vehicles sales tax increase&mdash;that will slug those who can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very timely that the member for Canning, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), is in the chamber because he also represents one of the fastest growing electorates in Western Australia. His electorate of Canning is another electorate that contains new urban sprawl&mdash;new suburbs, new developing areas and new homes&mdash;and the people who live there have to rely on their own passenger motor vehicles to get backwards and forwards to work. I ask the member for Canning: how can he justify to his constituents the enormous increases that he has foisted on to them when they can least afford it and when they have been hit in recent times by increases in the interest rates applicable on their homes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia we have already seen a substantial decline in housing starts. It is quite clear that this decline has been caused by the increase in on-costs, by a combination of government charges and federal government taxes. The statistics for 1993-94 show that there were 24,800 housing starts and, for 1994-95, 22,000. But, for 1995-96, only 18,000 housing starts are predicted. In my case, many of those starts will be in the city of Wanneroo&mdash;the fastest growing area, as I have mentioned, in the country. The member for Canning, the Assistant Treasurer, who is sitting at the table, would know this because he has a similar electorate to mine with a lot of developing areas and a lot of new home starts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer would know that he has had foisted on him, at a time when he is up against it to win his seat, increases that are going to cause his constituents to think twice and very seriously about ever voting for him again. One could argue that he ought to have had a more substantial voice in the cabinet room and put what was a quite clear, commonsensical case against the imposition of the wholesale sales tax on these various building products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put the case for the building industry. The building industry is a very substantial employer around the country, particularly in the Perth metropolitan area. One can question why the home building industry has been slugged again. It already pays its fair share of tax&mdash;$260 million was collected in 1992-93 from wholesale sales tax imposed on building materials. Home owners pay stamp duty and developers and builders are required to pay developer contributions on top of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument is that somehow this imposition of a wholesale sales tax increase on these building materials can be viewed in isolation, that it is somehow just another little charge that will slip in there and people will not notice. That is another furphy, another deliberate untruth, being mooted by this Labor government, which has been desperate to increase revenue just before the federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly you should see these cost increases on top of the others that I have already mentioned, one of which is the recent increase to housing interest rates which has slugged home buyers across the board. It also should be seen on top of new statutory requirements for fire protection and insulation improvements within homes, and also new termite protection measures that are applicable from 1 July 1995. If you look at it in the context of all these other increases and charges, you can see quite clearly that the poor old home buyer&mdash;the person who used to have the great Australian dream of buying a new home, moving their family in and starting their lives in a new home&mdash;is going to be harder hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the interest rate fluctuations, we have seen a slight dip but I believe that is only the calm before the storm&mdash;we are going to see more interest rate rises. Those people who will be hit are those who can least afford it&mdash;the home buyers. The new building tax is not quarantined. The tax base will be widened in following years to other building materials, systems and products, and the tax rate will increase from this 12 per cent GST to 22 per cent. Bearing in mind that a large number of building material products already attract the 21 per cent sales tax rate, from 1 July they are going to attract a 22 per cent sales tax. So there is another one per cent increase in sales tax. Quite clearly this is another oncost, and it can be seen as being a lessening of this government's commitment to the concept of home ownership within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came to this country in 1971 from the UK. One of the things that have appealed to me as a new Australian has been that in Australia there is a very strong commitment to personal home ownership. It is one of the great institutions in the Australian society that there is this great commitment on the part of Australians to home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that a good thing? Because it improves our communities to the extent that people obviously see they have a further commitment through their home ownership to their communities. This also provides a greater sense of community in areas that are fast developing, in areas that are new and, in the case of my electorate, in areas that until recently were urban bushland or undeveloped. It is important that we develop a sense of community, a sense of belonging, as soon as possible in these new communities principally to provide the sort of lifestyle that most Australians consider to be valuable or invaluable to their function of raising a family and being good Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is working against the commitment to home ownership. There is an overwhelming plan, a long-term objective, in this government's philosophy to destroy the concept of home ownership. That is anathema to the social engineers in the Labor government, those on the left and elsewhere, who believe that home ownership lessens the control of the state vis-a-vis the individual and that the abolition of home ownership is one of the major steps towards making our society a more collective society dominated by government and dominated by the fief of the fiefdoms of individual ministers and cabinet decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to implement these taxes, this government has also made it more difficult for people to pay their taxes. We have already seen&mdash;and we are indebted to Senator Baume&mdash;that you would get a gold medal for jumping over the income tax legislation at the Olympics. That is how high it is when you pile income tax book on top of income tax book, full of the legislation, regulations and decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes for a situation where individual taxpayers just do not understand the taxation system. How could they possibly understand it? It is hard enough for professional taxation accountants to understand the taxation legislation. Yet, here we have another situation where the administration is going to be more complicated. It is going to be a nightmare for building operators, particularly for those who are working on government housing projects which are exempt and for those who may be working on private sector projects at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be another added cost to the construction of homes because building companies are going to have to put on more accountants and more administrators to be able to work out the complexities of the sales tax administration. Small shops will bypass the kitchen and bathroom requirements because they will not be caught up in the system. We will see the situation where merchants will not give builders a breakdown of sales tax because it will disclose their buying prices. Many of them would not be anxious to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make another observation. Those who have taken an interest in the subject of home ownership and home construction would know that homes are often built by quite large project builders. Those builders would perhaps have several hundred home starts in a particular municipality or city. There are some large builders in Western Australia who would be building a large number of homes at any one time. Many builders are down to a fraction of their margins for the construction of homes. We have seen builders go out of business because of the competitive nature of the industry. </PARA>

When talking about the GST, we all remember that it was the honourable member for Moore&mdash;the member who was just talking about home buyers and the moves in this budget which are very modest indeed in terms of their impact on housing costs&mdash;that would have put a 15 per cent GST on everything that went into a house.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is making sure, as I say, that we keep interest rates down. Since the budget, I think opposition members would have to agree&mdash;if they were objective about this and had a look at the news reports and commentary that have come out, typically from institutions like Moody's&mdash;that there has been a downward pressure on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think about home buyers, we have to think about the main cost of buying a home&mdash;that is, servicing the loan. It is the case at present that home loan interest rates are around 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 per cent&mdash;way below what they were all the way through the 1980s, and a lot less than what they were when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. At that time, it was very difficult in that regulated environment to even get a loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember in 1982 and 1983 when, to get a loan from a bank, you would have had to have been with the bank from birth&mdash;and then you would not be given all your loan. The bank would give you what was known in those days as a `shandy'&mdash;that is, you would get about half your loan from the bank at the regulated rate and then be flipped over to the bank's finance company, where sometimes the rates were 18 to 20 per cent, to get the other half of the loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think about home buyers in 1995 and compare them with those in 1982 or 1983 when the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer, we find that today's home buyers are light years ahead. Home buyers in 1995 can actually afford to service the loan. The best part about it is that there are more of them. There are an extra two million jobs flowing from the policies of this government. It was a responsible budget, and the bills that we are debating today are an integral part of that budget and have been well received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in government likes putting taxes on items or increasing taxes on items but, from time to time, these things are necessary. Nobody complained when we slashed tariffs and wore that on the budget. If we had kept tariffs where they were, we would have had an extra $9 billion coming to the federal government. But the community has benefited from the $9,000 million that the government will not collect this year because we have cut tariffs. That is a direct benefit to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that: because we have lowered tariffs, we have a much more competitive, industrial structure in Australia today, an industrial structure that is up there with the best in the world. We are exporting things in 1995 that we could have only dreamed of in 1983. That has come about because we have lowered tariffs and forced Australian industry to compete. We have also given the industry decent policies to do it with. </PARA>

<PARA>This part of the schedule relates to those provisions in the bill which provide for the increase in sales tax on cars. As I indicated in the second reading debate, that is something which the coalition will vote against. We do that for one simple reason: that the measure the government is proposing today constitutes a direct reversal of that which was said in this place at that dispatch box by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. I remind the House briefly of what was said by the Prime Minister then:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent&mdash;a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he elaborated on that&mdash;and the point is still relevant today&mdash;by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries.</PARA>
<PARA>There could never in this place be an example of a more clear, unambiguous statement about what the government's intention was prior to the 1993 election; namely, that it would permanently&mdash;not temporarily, not for a period of a year, not for a period of a number of years&mdash;lower the sales tax on motor vehicles in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet here we are in this budget and in this particular sales tax bill with a measure which again raises the sales tax on cars. What we have, in effect, is a mechanism for use by the Prime Minister and the government. It was convenient for them prior to the last election, for electoral purposes, to reduce the sales tax on cars; to say simply, `We are doing something about bringing down costs on ordinary everyday goods for ordinary Australians; we are going to bring them down to 15 per cent.' However, now that the election is over, it is convenient to turn around and say, `Well, we're going to put it up again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this illustrates once again is that, when words like `permanent' are used by the Prime Minister, they mean exactly the opposite if he wishes them to&mdash;namely, `temporary'. When he comes into this place or goes to the National Press Club and says, `I'm not just making a promise to the people of Australia, I'm in fact legislating in l-a-w, law,' then you can bet your life that it will not mean l-a-w but the opposite. So we have seen in this bill, and in relation to this particular measure, the total reversal of that which was promised in this place, as I said, on 26 February 1992. Further words will not add to that argument. As I have indicated, we are therefore moving that those items be omitted from the schedule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Schedule 2, page 9, omit items 1-11.</PARA>
<PARA>In schedule 2 as it stands in the bill at present, are items 1 to 19, all of which deal with the proposal by the government in this legislation to increase from currently no sales tax on a range of building materials to 12 per cent on these items. It is divided into two sections so that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) can move an amendment, in effect, to introduce item 11A of that schedule. The reason why the coalition is moving to delete these items is that this again constitutes an act of electoral fraud on the part of the government to introduce against all the indications which it gave in this place and elsewhere prior to the last election any taxation on building materials and like matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes back into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and looks at, for example, the reply of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) on 5 May 1992 and the reply to a question from the opposition by the then Treasurer Mr Dawkins on 30 April 1992, one finds that there was a clear categorical rejection by the government then that it would tax in any way the building industry and building materials. But, now the election is over, it is convenient for the government to come in here and impose its GST on building materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the list of items covered by this amendment one sees things ranging from plaster and the materials that go into plaster to every nail, nut, washer and bolt that goes into a building, to every piece of glue or issue of glue used to screw materials together through to taps and nozzles and showerheads. They are all going to be taxed at 12 per cent under this item. In addition, when you have cupboards or a kitchen manufactured and brought into the house or you buy a new vanity unit for your bathroom then that too will be taxed at 12 per cent. This is coming from the government that campaigned across the length and breadth of this nation prior to the 1993 election saying, `We will not have a sales tax on these sorts of items.' Every Australian can remember the advertisement prior to the last election with the cash register ringing up 15 per cent and the government saying that we were going to do it. You were saying, `No. We don't need it. We are not going to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet here, in the life of the parliament in which the Labor Party was elected, it is doing the precise thing which it said it would not do; namely, it is adding a sales tax to these items. The moral of this story is the same as for the previous amendment which we voted on. The moral is that the words that come from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this nation can no longer be believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said, `We will permanently reduce the sales tax on cars.' Yet we find that that has only been a temporary measure. So the word `permanent' is meaningless in the dictionary of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister went to the National Press Club and said that not only was he going to make a promise&mdash;implied in that was that he believed that no-one would understand or accept his promise&mdash;but `These are l-a-w, law, tax cuts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Prime Minister now done? He has increased tax. So not only is a promise from the Prime Minister unbelievable; when he says, `I am going to legislate as well,' that is also unbelievable. In relation to this particular item, promises from the Prime Minister and from this government such as, `We're not going to introduce sales tax; we're not going to push up the prices for ordinary Australians on things like their cars and their homes,' are simply meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the people of Australia: anything that is said by the man who stands at this dispatch box&mdash;when he bothers to come in here&mdash;is simply meaningless. Any word that he gives cannot be taken on face value. In fact, if you were wise, you would say that we will trust the opposite of what he says rather than what he actually says. For those reasons, we will vote for this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that he is busy. But what I wanted to get was a response from the Treasurer regarding his admission that the revenue raised from the additional sales taxes included in this schedule&mdash;which he first made note of at the dispatch box on budget night&mdash;would be $215 million. He has now admitted that the likely sales tax on all of those products on an average home would be as high as $1,000. There has been no response from the government on what additional revenue this would raise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the figures in the 1995-96 budget are incorrect. The government has cooked the books because the budget states a particular figure of $215 million based on sales tax of $300 to $400 on these items. I understand that some of the colleagues of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in the Senate have admitted that the figure could be $800 or $1,000 and that one of your own colleagues in this chamber has said that it could be $1,500&mdash;</PARA>

If it is not correct, we want to know how much will be raised and how you arrived at that figure of whatever it might be&mdash;whether it is $645 million or $800 million. It is like the fringe benefits tax. When that went through the House, we were told that it would be only a small amount. We then found out that the figure ballooned out to a huge amount of money. It is appropriate for the Assistant Treasurer to respond by telling us what those taxes in this schedule will raise and whether or not the budget figures are incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the questions put by the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). We stand by our figures in the budget. The amount stated in the budget will be raised. We do not resile from that. On the other matter about the impact on houses: obviously, as you would know, the more expensive the house, the more tax will be raised from it. There is nothing new about that. That has been the same throughout the tax system ever since we brought it in.</PARA></TALK.START>

The tax may rise up to about $1,000 for a more substantial house. As for the amount of $2,500 claimed by the opposition, you would have to build a mansion for it to be that amount. The central question by the honourable member was: do we stand by our figures in the budget? Yes, we do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was somewhat amazed by the answer just given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and by his response when summing up the debate that this tax was necessary to sustain the recovery. What an extraordinary attitude the government takes to taxes. It finds the most intellectually amazing reasons to justify higher taxes. How on earth can you sustain a recovery by increasing taxes? This tax is going to hit the battler and the young family trying to get a start in life by building their first home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that, if the housing industry was booming, governments might be looking at ways to raise revenue from a booming industry. The housing industry is experiencing one of its most difficult times. The government's response to the difficult times in the housing industry is to make houses more expensive and, therefore, to guarantee that the industry will go through more times of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate has the lowest average income of any electorate in Australia. We are the epicentre of the battlers, a place where it is difficult for people to get established in life and to make ends meet. Hervey Bay is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, but the most significant industry in that city has been building. Now that essential element of the region's economy is to be slugged with a tax on its basic elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the Assistant Treasurer suggest that this tax is not going to affect the cost of a basic house, only the little bits and pieces you put into the house. What a load of nonsense. True, it does not actually affect the iron that goes on the roof, but how are you going to attach the roof to the house? With taxed nails or taxed screws. How are you going to affix the walls? With taxed screws and taxed nails. This tax applies to every element of the building of houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`It is only going to be $300 a house,' we were told on budget night. Then it grew to $400 or $500. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) has got it as high as $1,500. The reality is that this tax will probably be another fringe benefits tax and end up raising very much more than the government admitted when first introduced. If you are building a dog kennel, the increased cost may be only $300. If you are building a traditional family house, it is going to be very much more than that. This additional tax will be an enormous burden on the entire building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will particularly affect the joining industry and those who are associated with putting together the various fittings that make up a house that is worth living in. These are the sorts of elements that will attract this punitive tax as a result of this legislation. I have already had letters and phone calls from joiners in my electorate who are particularly concerned about the way this tax affects them rather than others in the building industry. If you build cupboards in a house you will not be subjected to this tax. If you buy a ready-made kitchen, it will be taxable. That distorts the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the effect which this tax will have not just on housing but on commercial buildings. I wonder whether the Assistant Treasurer would care to respond about the effect of this tax on the cost of a new hotel, for instance. Clearly, if you are putting in built-in cupboards of the type that are normally used in houses, this tax will apply to those cupboards. The extra cost for a new hotel could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars. It will be a significant and adverse tax on the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not coming clean about the effects of this tax. It has not been able to get its own act together in respect of the effects of the tax on houses, let alone on commercial buildings, hotels and the like. This is another tax on the battler. It is another example of the government intending to stamp out those who want to make their life a little more pleasant and who aspire to the great Aussie dream of owning their own home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, the best thing you can do for home owners in Australia is to keep interest rates down, and that is what this government has done. I will repeat what I said earlier. The current interest rates that people are paying now are two to three per cent lower than they were all the way through the 1980s and they are a lot lower than they were under the regulated regime of the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) when he was Treasurer. This budget was all about keeping those interest rates down. We have done the best we can to make sure that home owners can move into their homes and sustain their repayments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in a couple of arguments that have been put forward those opposite have brought up the fringe benefits tax  and the fact that the estimates of the amounts raised were somewhat conservative, and those opposite laugh at that. But we did not understand the amount of fringe benefits being paid in the Australian community instead of wages. We did not know that. The former Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, never taxed those things. He was happy to have a taxation system that taxed all of the workers' wages&mdash;the battlers' wages. The PAYE taxpayer paid 100 per cent under the then Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition. But what about the executives who took 50 per cent of their income in cash and 50 per cent in kind? Of course, the current Leader of the Opposition did not want to know about the other 50 per cent in kind, but we did. That is why we brought in the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We makes no apologies for bringing in the fringe benefits tax, even though you opposed it at the time we brought it in. It showed how fringe benefits had become part of the landscape out in the business community and how right we were in retrospect&mdash;that is always the best position to speak from&mdash;to bring in that tax. History has shown us that where we have made these taxation adjustments they have been the proper ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite jump up and down and say, `What a terrible thing the taxation measures in this budget are,' yet you will not tell us what you were going to do. We know that, had you been in government at the last election, the impost that you would have put on not only home owners but everybody in the community would have left these tax measures far behind. The taxation regime that you were going to put on Australians would have resulted in a 15 per cent tax on all of these building materials but, worse than that, it would have resulted in a 15 per cent tax on the labour that went into them. That is what you were proposing. So you do not come into this debate with clean hands. You come with a proposal that you put to the people at the last election that would have decimated the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, these measures are very modest indeed. They help a budget that will make sure that we have a sustainable recovery into the future and they also keep interest rates down, which is the best thing you can do for home buyers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer really has not responded adequately. A number of different spokesmen in his party have given us different answers to every question that we have asked about how much money will be raised on each house. Give us a couple of examples. What would it cost on a $75,000 house? What would it cost on a $100,000 house? What would it cost on an average new home, which in my electorate is probably about $125,000 to $150,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staggering admission that the government did not know how much revenue would be raised by the fringe benefits tax indicates to me that it had done no work on it beforehand. It could not even give an estimate. It has the figure of $215 million in the budget papers which represents the tax on all of these building products, yet it cannot really assure the House or people who are trying to build a house exactly how much money will be raised.

For the illumination of the House, it has been pointed out to me that in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> there is an article about home ownership now being within the grasp of 70 per cent of householders.

<PARA>This has been written after the budget. More and more people are now able to get into houses. Opposition members can ask me the question as many times as they like, but the answer will be exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say one more thing. Interest rates in some cases have been falling. A one per cent interest rate cut on a $75,000 mortgage is equal to $750 a year. Have a think about that and have a think about the interest rate regime when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. We have achieved a saving of $750 for one percentage point. Just think what he had. The fact is that he was the home loan interest king. He had them at the highest levels they ever were. As I said before, as long as we can keep the pressure on interest rates to remain lower than they otherwise would be, we are doing the best thing we can by home buyers. This survey, which has been released today, just proves that more and more people are able to get into their own homes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to enter this argument on the sales tax bills until I heard some of the responses coming from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). They show that he does not go home on the weekends to mix in the electorate to find out what the effects of the 12 per cent tax will be on housing. If he did, he would find that the reaction would be quite different from that which he gets in the cabinet room, where these decisions are made, and quite different from the reaction he gets from the Treasury department that recommends these types of things. It is going to be an imposition not only on home owning throughout Australia but particularly on joinery works which have been operating on a very thin margin up to this stage. To have to sell their product with a 12 per cent tax on their labour content is right out of this world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to debunk the argument the Assistant Treasurer has used so far about the GST. Obviously, he did not understand the GST then, and he does not understand it now. As far as housing is concerned, there was never any indication that there was going to be a 15 per cent tax on labour. This is a tax on labour. Joinery works now have to add a 12 per cent manufacturing cost to their price on site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take up the point the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) made that this is going to have an effect in regional Australia. The 12 per cent tax will be added to the cost of freight to get the materials from the major timber works to site. He compared the 12 per cent tax, although on a limited amount, with the 15 per cent GST. But this does not have any compensating factors. The cost of fuel, the cost of payroll tax and the reduction of private individual taxation measures are not included in the tax&mdash;in fact, it is the reverse. We are going to get an increase in Medicare, an increase in company rates of taxation and an increase in the cost of motor vehicles. There is no compensating factor in this at all.

It is more efficient to have them manufactured in a central location because you achieve economies of scale and there are national benefits in producing things as efficiently as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), implied that the coalition was going to oppose all of the tax measures in this budget: that we were against all tax increases. It is true that we believe in lower taxes. We believe that the country would be very much better off if there was less of a burden on business, less of a burden on those who earn and less of a burden on the productive sector of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our fundamental objection to the tax increases in this budget is that they represent gross dishonesty on behalf of the government. At the National Press Club, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised, in words of one syllable that everybody could understand, `What we are promising is we will not put up taxes.' That was a simple assurance given to the Australian people. It was a simple promise made that we all thought we could understand. It was l-a-w. It was a clear promise that there would be no increases in taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very next budget, only months after the election, we had the biggest range of tax increases in the history of our nation. That has continued in every budget since. We believe that governments should be honest with the Australian people: when they say no new taxes, they should mean no new taxes and it should deliver no new taxes. This tax is a part of this government's dishonesty. We believe that there should be a commitment to the Australian people from members of parliament: when they make promises, they will honour them. By moving this amendment, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is seeking to impose a degree of honesty on government members that they do not consider they have to sustain for themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make a few points about the remarks that have been made about labour being taxed. I could use the argument that is being used and say that any manufactured product contains some component of labour. If I buy a brand new car, obviously some labour has been put into manufacturing that car. Opposition members would understand that when we buy a brand new car, we have to pay the wholesale sales price on it. The wholesale sales price on that car reflects the tax that we put on that manufactured good. Opposition members would understand that point. If we are talking about products that go into the home, we see that the same argument holds true. If a product is made for a home, there is a percentage of labour component in it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Always has been. But the point I am making is this: any manufactured component or good has a percentage of labour in it. What we tax of that is the wholesale sales tax rate. Nothing has changed in this budget, from the budget before, the budget before that or the budget before that. Nothing has changed. What the opposition is saying now is that somehow this year's budget has changed all that. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) is shaking his head, but I just heard his interjection. When I asked him whether this was a new tax, he said, `Yes, it is.' But it is not. And now he is agreeing with me that it is not a new tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition's argument is convoluted. The simple fact is that the only thing that has changed in this budget has been that some items which go into buildings which were previously exempt from tax now have a 12 per cent concessional rate on them. We agree on that point. But to extrapolate from that the argument that somehow there was not a tax on labour inputs into a manufactured product before this budget but there is now is wrong, and the opposition knows that it is wrong. So the argument just falls down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have been asking about the impact of this tax on a new house, and I gave an answer which I think is broadly correct. I had some figures brought down to me and I will read them out for the benefit of the House. They are broadly in line with what I said. It is not possible to give a precise estimate of the impact on the price of a new house because the size of the impact depends on the cost of the relevant fittings. However, for most new houses, the impact is expected to be in the range of $300 to $1,000. For a medium new house in the capital cities costing $155,000&mdash;that is house and land&mdash;the impact may be around $500 to $800. For a medium new house on an Australia-wide basis costing $131,200&mdash;that is house and land&mdash;the impact may be around $450 to $700. For a modest house with modest fittings&mdash;that is for a modest house and land package of around $100,000 to $120,000 with the house being around 55 per cent of the cost&mdash;the tax impact may be around $400. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures are broadly in line with the responses I gave to previous questions. That is putting it as well as I can. You can see that some of the figures that were being floated around really were out of the ballpark, particularly those of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) who talked about $2,500&mdash;you would have to have a pretty big house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just read out one other fact: a one per cent reduction in interest rates would boost loan affordability by eight per cent, the equivalent of a reduction in housing prices of $9,800. Clearly, it is difficult to argue that home buyers would benefit from the removal of the proposed tax if that removal were at the cost of putting in doubt the budget outcome of putting downward pressure on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to my central point, which is this: this budget is aimed at getting sustainable growth into the future and putting downward pressure on interest rates. If you are talking about home buyers and battlers, the best thing you can do for them is to keep interest rates down. Those payments come in every month. On the figures relating to a $75,000 loan, which I read out before, if you could save them about $750 a year, you are doing much more for them than anything this budget has an impact on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government stands by the figures in the budget. It is doing everything it can for housing affordability. As the newspaper article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> points out, never has there been a period in our history where home loan affordability has been higher than it is at present. </PARA>

I can tell the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) that for a sole operator in a joinery, earning $700 a week, this sales tax will mean 12 per cent on $700 extra on his product&mdash;not including the add-ons to that $700. That is a fact. It is a 12 per cent tax on that $700.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will talk about compensation, which we have already spoken about. It was very real compensation. As far as a house owner is concerned, we could demonstrate that there would be a net reduction over the whole package. People in my electorate are not buying houses because they fear a repeat of what happened five or six years ago. They see the budget for what it is&mdash;a short-term measure, but giving no long-term stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that interest rates will be forced down initially but after the election they will go back to the level where they were five or six years ago. Do not talk to me about compensation in terms of interest and the reduction of a mortgage. That has not been effected yet. That outcome has not been seen in my electorate, and I do not think it will be seen until more is demonstrated to show that the budget is for real and is going to achieve those ends. When you talk about an interest rate reduction to support the dollar when we are going to have a trade deficit of $27 billion, do not talk to me in terms of realisable compensation for this cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I talk about the administrative problems. The honourable member for Chifley reminded me that there are joiners that I know who cannot get a proper method of calculation of this tax, which is to come in on 1 July, from your office. Apparently that advice is still coming; it is still to be worked out. We have people who are trying to run a business who do not know what the position on the wholesale price will be after 1 July. What we know for sure is that there is going to be a tax on the labour, there is going to be tax on the freight, there is going to be tax on the material and there is going to be a tax on the profit margin on the wholesale price; and that that tax is as yet undetermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you talk about administration, think of the initial administration involved in trying to comply with this law and the compliance cost once it is in place. I will go on record and say that there is nothing more convoluted and misunderstood in this country than the wholesale sales tax laws. You could probably take all of Australia and the Australian Taxation Office and you would get only a dozen people who understand sales tax. That is about it. The compliance cost is going to be for real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chifley also indicated that the budget was a surprise to him. I will bet it was a surprise! When he goes back to his electorate he will get a bigger surprise. I would like to see any of the government members at a meeting of joiners, or at a meeting of householders or potential home owners or even current home owners, trying to convince them that the possible interest rate reduction is compensation for paying the up-front additional cost of a house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say that the $300 cost for one range that was mentioned must be for a tent with a built-in mobile kitchen or something like that. I will go back to the point that, if you just buy a ready-made kitchen at a shop&mdash;I am not talking about any of the other joinery in the house at all&mdash;you are going to pay $3,000 to $4000 for a modest one in a $100,000 house. </PARA>

<PARA>I apologise for holding the House up earlier in the debate. There is a rather novel process in this bill, in that schedule 2 of this amending bill amends schedule 1 of the parent act. That was the where the mix-up in my thinking occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke on this matter during the second reading debate. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) was not here at that time. I doubt whether he is hanging on my every word to hear, but he does know about the circumstances surrounding and the reasons for my moving these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first part of 1993, I received representations from a constituent who has a driving licence and, having passed an advanced driving course, drives without arms. I made representations to Mr Dawkins, when he was Treasurer, and, subsequently, to the Assistant Treasurer sitting at the table today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not made any public politics of this matter over that two-year period, hoping that the government and the minister in particular would see the justice of putting these people who drive without use of their arms on the same legislative basis as those who drive without the use of their legs. For the information of the House, for those members who may not know the detail of this matter, the safeguard and the oversight of issuing these licences is in the hands of the secretary to the department, who must give a certificate that the person is fully employed, uses the vehicle for the purposes of transport to and from that employment and that he or she cannot use public transport because of the loss of use of, as the bill now stands in schedule 1, lower limbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine the advent of thalidomide effects has centred attention now on those who drive without arms, and the act therefore contains an inequity in that it does not include those with the loss of arms. My long series of contacts with the minister over this elicited an answer from him that these people could obtain a disability payment, which they can, and this in effect would equal the advantage of an exemption from the sales tax for the purchase of their vehicles. The immediate response of my constituent was, `Look, I am a full working member of this community. I do not want to go on social security or social services when in fact what I am asking for is to be placed in the same position as others with a loss of use of lower limbs.' I agree entirely that these people should not be differentiated by the fact that the schedule to the act did not envisage the need for this particular inclusion when it was written. I think it is insulting to people who go to that extra effort, with all of these difficulties, to maintain their morale and their attitude, to say, `You can go on social service,' rather than, `I as a minister will put you on an equal level with those already mentioned in the schedule of the act.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response contains its own inconsistency in that, having offered a payment, he cannot argue the lack of inclusion on financial grounds. He says, `Finance is not a question. I will give you the money in a disability payment.' So what we are talking about is the simple matter of equity, an equal level of regard by the community for disabilities. I think the case is overwhelming. I had a look at the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and that act does not cover this case because the comparison there for the action under the act is between the person disabled and a person who is not disabled. We have this finer point here that this person and others like her are being discriminated against on a judgment of disability to disability, not disability to no disability. But it is the same principle, and I draw to the minister's attention that the intention of the act is to make it an offence to discriminate, and this current legislation does discriminate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with interest to the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), a member whom I might say I have a high regard for. I have served with him on a number of committees. He went through what I believe to be the proper procedure in seeking for his constituent some redress to the concern that she had. He did not politicise this argument. He has gone through it, I think, in a model fashion. I can tell him that we will be accepting his amendment. We are doing it because it seems to us that the points that he makes are right. Back when this concession was given, it was never envisaged that people without arms could drive cars, and he would agree with that. It was entirely possible in those days that people without legs could drive, but technology has gone a fair way since then and people without arms can now drive too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make this general point about the way in which we give concessions: it is better that they are given on outlays than through the taxation system. I think he would agree on that. But we are not here today to argue about that because, historically, this concession has been given to one set of people and not to another. This amendment moved by the member for Boothby will redress that. But it is not the most desirable way. The best way that you can give assistance to people who unfortunately find themselves in this position is on the outlays. That is why we do have a mobility allowance which is paid at $52.40 per fortnight, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that anybody who is buying a car for $19,640 or less is financially better off in taking the mobility allowance rather than taking the concession on the car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about today is equality of treatment for handicapped people. As a result of the amendment moved by the member for Boothby, people who do not have arms or people who do not have legs, who are in the work force and wish to buy a car to get to work, will now be treated in exactly the same way. They will have the choice of the tax concession or the mobility allowance. Perhaps debate on the underpinning philosophy behind assistance to people with disabilities can be left to another day. But I make the general point that when we are giving assistance of this kind it is much better done on the outlays, because for anybody who can afford to buy a car, for instance, for $40,000 the benefit that goes to that person is about twice that for somebody who buys a car for $20,000. The government will accept the amendment from the member for Boothby. I congratulate him on the way he has handled this matter, which is a model for others. </PARA>

<PARA>These items also relate to the increased tax on the building industry and on housing which has been the subject of some debate in this place so far. I want to address a couple of the remarks that have been made by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in relation to this measure. He is suggesting to members of this chamber, and to the people of Australia generally, that somehow this measure is not a new tax. The way he does that is by saying, `There is already a tax on manufactured goods and all we are doing is including some more manufactured goods under the schedules and, therefore, it is not a new tax.' But, of course, there is no tax at the present time on kitchen cupboards. There is no tax on the variety of other building materials which are referred to here, ranging from nails and bolts and screws and glue and plaster materials right through to taps and shower heads and nozzles. There is no tax on them at the present time. But, as of 1 July, if this measure passes, there will be a tax on those items. So it is using words in a very curious way to say that this does not involve a new tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which this tax is implemented actually distorts the market. If a person wishes to have his kitchen remodelled or get new kitchen cupboards, there are two ways in which it can be done. One is that he can have the kitchen cupboards made up in a joiner's workshop and then put together in his kitchen. If he does it that way, he will be charged 12 per cent tax on the final price. That price includes not only the materials that go into making the doors, walls, benchtops and every other component of the kitchen but also the labour that went into making them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer is not going to stand here and say that, if the kitchen supplier gives that man a bill which itemises labour as a separate component from the goods which are supplied, he will only charge sales tax on the goods supplied. Of course he will not. He is going to charge sales tax on the final price which is paid, and that includes the labour component. This is a tax on goods and services. There is no running away from that fact. It also distorts the market because, if a builder makes the kitchen from scratch in the person's house, he will charge the tax on the components that go into making the kitchen units, but he will not charge a tax on the labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes from a minister who has charge of the Hilmer recommendations for new competition policy in Australia. He stands up in parliament every second day and says, `We must remove the distortions in competition throughout the economy,' yet here he is introducing a distortion into the housing economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that a new tax is being introduced on materials which go into the building of houses. This completely changes what the government said prior to the last election. This government said before the election, `We won't do this,' and now it comes in and does it. Everyone in Australia ought to remember that the moral of this is that this is a government which cannot be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coming weeks and months&mdash;however long it is to the next election which is now looming&mdash;when the people of Australia think about anything that has been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or members of this government, they should remember this measure and the other measures introduced by this government which have reversed what the government had promised it would or would not do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the bill is to establish the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, as a Commonwealth authority with responsibility for aviation safety regulation. A separate bill, the Air Services Bill 1995, has been introduced in the House to establish Airservices Australia as a government business enterprise to operate Australia's national airways system and associated services. The two bills provide the legislative framework for the creation of two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed arrangements build on the government's announcements of 20 July 1994 and 12 October 1994 on new aviation safety arrangements. This included the decision to remove the aviation safety regulatory function from the Civil Aviation Authority and place it in a separate and entirely independent statutory authority; the decision to fund that part of the safety regulation function which had been identified as `public goods'; a direction to the CAA to establish a formal system which automatically triggers an increase in safety surveillance of operators who are known to be in financial difficulty; approval for the CAA to recruit an additional 57 staff to resource adequately its safety regulatory function in terms of both staff numbers and requisite skills; a request to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to conduct an inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors of the industry; and an increase in the maximum compensation available to fare paying passengers in the event of an aircraft accident to $500,000 per passenger for Australia's domestic and international airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will provide the regulatory framework for civil aviation in Australia. CASA's regulatory functions include standard setting, safety surveillance of the industry and enforcement of standards, entry control and licensing. Its additional responsibilities include regulatory oversight of the national airways system, air traffic services and aviation rescue and firefighting services provided by Airservices Australia and administration of the carriers' mandatory death or injury insurance arrangements which the government announced on 12 October 1994. CASA will also be required to place much greater emphasis on safety awareness and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, BASI, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia constitute a tripartite structure for providing safe aviation, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. The government also intends to introduce separate legislation to increase BASI's capacity to conduct more sophisticated, systemic investigations and analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The target date for the establishment of CASA and Airservices Australia is 1 July 1995. The separation of the regulatory and service provider functions, as proposed in the two bills before the House, will provide a much clearer focus on aviation safety regulation and ensure that there is no conflict with the more commercial goals of the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 March 1995, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for comment. The committee sought comments on the bills and took evidence at a public hearing during the week commencing 24 April 1995. It issued an advisory report on 11 May 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister and the government are grateful to the committee for conducting its aviation bills inquiry at short notice and for the constructive comments in its advisory report. I will address the committee's specific recommendations later in this second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing committee's 11 May 1995 advisory report noted that there was broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority, and endorsed this approach. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised board and a new director is a far better solution for the troubled world of aviation safety regulation in Australia than any reorganisation within the existing Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of safety is reinforced in both bills through a requirement that, in exercising powers and performing their functions, CASA and Airservices Australia must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CASA's leadership, strategic direction and management of aviation safety will be considerably enhanced through its establishment as an independent authority, the appointment of an acknowledged expert on aviation safety as its new director and the subsequent appointment of a small, expert board. CASA's board will comprise the chairperson, the Director of Aviation Safety and up to three other members. A major priority of the board and the Director of Aviation Safety will be to address the various management problems that have emerged over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may give CASA written instructions as to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers but, in respect of the performance of CASA's regulatory function, the directions shall be only of a general nature. The bill also provides that the minister may give CASA notices about its strategic direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes provision for CASA to provide a corporate plan that includes objectives, strategies and performance measures, an analysis of aviation safety risk factors and human resource and industrial relations strategies. The minister must respond to the plan and may direct the board to vary the plan. As recommended by the standing committee, the legislation will be amended to require the corporate plan to be tabled in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that the proposed responsibility and accountability framework in the bill provides a proper balance between the exercise of ministerial strategic direction and accountability and the day-to-day exercise by CASA of its functions and powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to safety being the most important consideration, CASA will be required to have regard to the environment in the exercise of its functions. This will ensure that, as far as possible, the community will be protected from any adverse effects of aircraft operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the importance of air operators' certificates&mdash;AOCs&mdash;as a safety regulatory tool in respect of commercial operators, the CASA legislation brings together the main requirements relating to AOCs in a single, integrated set of provisions. Currently, these provisions appear in a variety of regulatory documents, and consolidation of the provisions will make them more accessible both to industry and to the regulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision is made for CASA to be the body responsible for ensuring that all carriers of passengers are insured against their liability for death or injury to passengers. The government has already introduced legislation to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act to make it mandatory for all operators to be so insured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As announced in October 1994, the government will continue to fund that part of aviation safety regulation that has been identified as the public benefit component, for example, standard setting, enforcement and provision of safety awareness information. Other aspects of aviation safety regulation, which primarily benefit the travelling public and the aviation industry, will continue to be met by a combination of charges and levies on the aviation industry. These proposed cost recovery arrangements for CASA will be reviewed prior to preparation of the 1996-97 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to a number of initiatives for CASA to enhance its effectiveness in providing safety regulation to the Australian aviation industry. The most important include the aviation safety surveillance program&mdash;which will provide an assessment of the safety health of the aviation industry and enable implementation of follow-up responses&mdash;and a review of the system of flight crew testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision has been made in the bill for the transfer of assets and for the transfer of staff, under the same terms and conditions as apply at present, from the Civil Aviation Authority to the new authority. The government also intends that rights, debts, liabilities and obligations&mdash;including insurance aspects&mdash;will be allocated to CASA in accordance with the functions transferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides that both CASA and Airservices Australia must, where appropriate, consult with government, industrial, commercial, consumer and other relevant bodies and organisations, including the International Civil Aviation Organisation and bodies representing the aviation industry. Both the boards of CASA and Airservices Australia will be asked to provide the Minister for Transport with proposals for consultative arrangements with industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the standing committee's aviation bills inquiry, the government has accepted 10 of the 12 recommendations totally or substantially and, as necessary, will be moving amendments to accommodate these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recommended by the committee, the government will reclassify CASA's functions to avoid any confusion between the object clause and the functions clause. The government also proposes a number of technical amendments to accommodate, inter alia, suggested changes proposed by the other House's Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House committee noted that item 28 of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill omits subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act. That subsection requires the authority, in so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, to `have regard to any costs that would arise from complying with the standards'. Some industry representatives indicated concern that the ultimate issue of cost might not be addressed and that a focus on enabling more people to participate in aviation would recognise that regulation has its costs without explicit reference to costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee proposed that the object clause be a broad in-principle statement of purpose which should include reference to the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation and that, pending the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill, subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the committee's proposed changes to the object clause run the risk of diluting the safety intent of the bill. They seek to establish a dual mandate for CASA by requiring CASA not only to regulate aviation safety but to foster the aviation industry. They introduce uncertainty as to how CASA should `recognise the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation' and they could be used to challenge the validity of safety rules on the basis that they may have an economic impact on industry. In short, they involve the inclusion of the concept of `affordable safety' under another name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also present a real danger of what the committee described as `regulatory capture'&mdash;which could happen if CASA (the regulator) is seen to be `accountable' to industry (the regulated). As the committee itself noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CASA should be accountable to the minister, the Parliament and the courts and to no one else.</PARA>
<PARA>The government considers the question of costs is most appropriately addressed through the relevant provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill. Under this bill, CASA will be required to put in place a mandatory consultation process before any civil aviation regulation is made to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunity to comment. CASA will also be required to prepare a legislative instruments proposal which contains a summary of the proposal and its objectives, an analysis of alternatives to meet the objectives, an indication of relative costs and benefits to government and the affected public of the proposal and alternatives and reasons for the preferred approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government therefore proposes to respond to the committee's concerns by firstly amending the object clause so that it is a broad in-principle statement of purpose as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, a written direction will be issued to the CASA board immediately upon its establishment requiring CASA to comply with the relevant provisions in the Legislative Instruments Bill, pending its enactment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also proposed that the purpose of clause 28(2) be elaborated. This clause provides that the financial position of the applicant is one of the matters that CASA may take into account in issuing an air operators certificate. Clause 28BC(3) enables CASA to take into account the financial position of an AOC holder when making a decision to impose or vary AOC conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the government's broad strategy, to improve air safety regulation in Australia, the minister issued a written direction to the Civil Aviation Authority that it should establish a formal system which would trigger an automatic increase in safety surveillance of any operator found to be in financial defaults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that CASA has a safety regulatory role: it does not provide CASA with the powers of an economic regulator to control the entry and licensing of operators in the industry or to monitor their financial affairs. The bill, nevertheless, allows CASA to take into account information about financial viability in order to assess whether the applicant can meet other provisions, for example, the requirement to maintain an appropriate organisation, with a sufficient number of qualified personnel and an effective management structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial problems do not necessarily imply that safety standards are not being met. However, the bill empowers CASA to have regard to information about the financial viability of a particular operator in deciding whether or not to conduct a detailed safety audit of the operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it mandatory to consider the financial position of an operator would interfere with CASA's responsibilities as a safety regulator since CASA would be required to undertake a financial viability test before it could suspend or cancel an AOC, with consequent, and potentially damaging, delays in CASA taking the necessary regulatory enforcement action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 20A of the Civil Aviation Act contains offences in relation to the flying or operation of aircraft in a manner likely to endanger life or cause danger to person or property. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it was difficult in some circumstances to obtain a conviction under this section, principally because the risk of danger that would have to be proved would be substantial or probable danger, even to the extent of actual injuries being sustained. The bill therefore contains amendments to section 20A along the lines proposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have been raised that the proposed amendment casts the net too wide in that legitimate aviation activities, such as training pilots, could be in breach of the revised provision. Following advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the government proposes that the amendments to section 20A be withdrawn from the bill, that is, the current position be retained. The minister has asked the standing committee to look specifically at the issue as part of its broader inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors, with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between the public interest in preventing dangerous flying and  the legitimate  needs  of  the  aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, members will be aware that there are a number of inquiries into aspects of aviation safety at present, including the standing committee's aviation safety inquiry and the Staunton inquiry into certain aspects of the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to Seaview Air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the significance of the structural changes encompassed by these bills, the government is unwilling to delay their implementation until the outcome of these inquiries is known. However, the government will give careful consideration to the findings of these inquiries and report to parliament on its proposed responses, including any necessary legislative amendments. The minister noted that the standing committee accepted the need for the two bills to be passed in the current sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that this legislation package will give a clearer and stronger focus on aviation safety and restore public and industry confidence in the safety of aviation operations. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIR SERVICES BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech introducing the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and in past statements, it has been made clear that the two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia, together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, will constitute a tripartite structure, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to establish Airservices Australia as the airways service provider. Airservices Australia will be established as a government business enterprise. Its functions will include the provision of airways facilities and air traffic services, an aeronautical information service, a national aviation rescue and firefighting service, an aviation search and rescue service and radio navigation and telecommunications. Additionally, Airservices Australia will be required to undertake specified environmental functions such as noise monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the performance of its functions, Airservices Australia, like the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration. Subject to this requirement, the bill makes provision for Airservices Australia to perform its functions in a manner that ensures that, as far as is practicable, the environment is protected from the effects of aircraft operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia will be governed by a board comprising a chairperson, deputy chairperson, chief executive officer and six other members, appointed on a part-time basis. The finance provisions in the Air Services Bill, including those relating to the corporate plan, are consistent with provisions contained in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1995, which establishes core accountability and finance provisions for Commonwealth bodies. The provisions relating to ministerial direction, the board, the chief executive officer and miscellaneous matters are adapted from those provisions applying to the former Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure aviation bills inquiry in an advisory report, dated 11 May 1995, commenting on this bill and the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, recommended that the corporate plans of both organisations be tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days of the minister receiving the final version. The government has accepted this recommendation in relation to CASA because of the nature of its plan as a broad strategic document rather than a business plan. However, the government considers that such a recommendation in relation to Airservices Australia is inconsistent with government policy that such documents remain confidential between the minister and the GBE concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Civil Aviation Authority, Airservices Australia will be required to pay payroll taxes but will not presently be liable to pay other taxes under any law of a state or territory. The government proposes that a review be conducted next year to examine the nature of the Airservices Australia enterprise and its capital structure. The application of all state and territory taxes to Airservices Australia, consistent with the competition principles agreement agreed by Commonwealth, state and territory leaders at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in April 1995, will also be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill further proposes that Airservices Australia will inherit the rights, debts, liabilities and obligations, including insurance aspects, and assets of the service provider functions of the former Civil Aviation Authority. Relevant staff will be compulsorily transferred from the Civil Aviation Authority to Airservices Australia on its establishment under the same terms and conditions that apply at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of Airservices Australia, without the regulatory function of the former Civil Aviation Authority, will enable the new body to continue to serve Australia and international aviation by providing world class aviation services and facilities. The government looks to Airservices Australia to build upon these achievements in the future. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend the bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my remarks this afternoon on behalf of the opposition by stating that we will not be opposing these bills, the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill and the Air Services Bill. Indeed, we will be making some amendments, which I will outline in my speech this afternoon, which we think will add further force and meaning to the two bills we are debating this afternoon. These bills are an important moment for me. They are important because the presentation of these bills and the work that has gone into splitting up the CAA and creating two new authorities that have a function to perform in the aviation industry are much due to the work that I have been doing following on from the Monarch crash of June 1993. This Saturday will be the second anniversary of the crash at Young, of Monarch flight 301, in which 7 people were killed, five of them my constituents, six of them people I knew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that date there has been a lot of publicity and interest in the Monarch crash and subsequently the Seaview crash which occurred in October of last year. My speech in May of last year in this House was followed up with another speech in early June of last year in which I outlined my concerns about Monarch Airlines and the things that I felt needed to be done to overcome the problems that had allowed Monarch Airlines to continue to operate in an unsafe fashion and that ultimately led to the deaths of those seven people two years ago this weekend. So I feel a degree of involvement with this legislation and some responsibility for it and some degree of pride that, as a result of the efforts we have put in, these changes are now before the House in the form of the two bills we are debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when I started to look into the Monarch crash there was very quickly available to me a series of anecdotes and some evidence that indicated to me that the circumstances surrounding Monarch Airlines were not the iceberg but rather the tip of the iceberg and that there were other airlines operating in a similar fashion because of the failure of our Civil Aviation Authority to, in my view, correctly and effectively administer aviation safety in this country. In the speech that I made in May of last year I said there were other airlines posing a threat to public safety. One of those that I named was Seaview Airlines. As history will unfortunately show, that proved to be correct in October of last year, when nine people were killed in an accident on a flight to Lord Howe Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the things we have seen happen since the Monarch crash prove to a reasonable man that the body charged with administering aviation safety in our country was not doing the job that the public would expect of it. The evidence of that was there to be seen in the form of those two air disasters and, indeed, in other examples which came to me as I started to take a public profile in my concerns about aviation safety. It seemed that the CAA was an unusual body. It did not have many friends. The people in the industry disliked it intensely. Few people were prepared to say a kind word for it. People were frightened to say a bad word about it publicly because they felt the fear of persecution. We have seen plenty of examples of how the CAA can persecute people if it takes that idea into its head. We have seen how poorly administered the Civil Aviation Authority was, how bureaucratic it was, how expensive it was in some areas. We also saw how inward-looking the Civil Aviation Authority was and how self-defensive it had become. Indeed, those who looked at the Civil Aviation Authority witnessed an organisation that was prepared to shoot the messenger rather than listen to the message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an organisation&mdash;I think many people who have looked into the CAA over time would agree with me&mdash;that was a complete shambles. That shambles led to a chronic failure to properly regulate civil aviation safety in this country. I drew this matter to the attention of the parliament in May of last year and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) personally&mdash;I think it was the following day&mdash;when we talked about it over lunch. I said that I felt there was a need not only to have an inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority but also to make some very substantial changes. The minister listened to what I had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A short while afterwards&mdash;I think it was in June of that year&mdash;on the same day as the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's release of its findings into the Monarch crash, the minister announced that there would be an inquiry into the Civil Aviation Authority conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris); that the Civil Aviation Authority would be split; and that a whole host of other changes in relation to insurance and so forth would be implemented over the next few months as the government dealt with it in its legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told the minister at the time that I felt he had made one mistake: he was splitting the Civil Aviation Authority in two to differentiate between its regulatory and commercial functions but the new regulatory body was still reporting to the chief executive officer of the CAA and to the board of the CAA. I thought that was an inappropriate split and would not overcome one of the principal problems that had been identified in my work which was that the commercial interests of the CAA often overrode the regulatory interests of the CAA. To leave the structure in the way that he had originally proposed would mean that the commercial interests would still overlap the regulatory needs of the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having said that, following the Seaview crash in October of last year the minister then took the opportunity to follow that up. He decided to create two totally separate and independent organisations&mdash;the two organisations we are debating in the legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going into the legislation in more specific terms, I make the point that this legislation comes to the parliament before the completion of our aviation safety inquiry chaired by the honourable member for Shortland. The inquiry will not be completed for two or three more months. I hope it will be concluded by the end of August. The Morris committee has not fully finished the process of review and inquiry that it has been undertaking for quite some time now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would expect that we will be back in this House at some future date&mdash;I hope sooner rather than later&mdash;to add further amendments to these two bills which will reflect the findings and recommendations of what is commonly called the Morris committee. I take this opportunity to thank the chairman of that committee, the member for Shortland. He has been a good chairman throughout the process that we have been engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who has been a very diligent attendee of all of the aviation safety inquiry hearings. He has shown a great interest in this issue. I would like to thank him for his considerable contribution to the inquiry. Both of us, as well as other members of the committee, have put a lot of our time into this inquiry. Therefore, we want to ensure that, at the conclusion of our studies, our findings will be reflected in further amendments to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the honourable member for Shortland and the honourable member for Corio would agree with me that, in the course of running this inquiry, we have heard some incredible stories from people in the Civil Aviation Authority and those associated with the industry. These stories would lead us to believe that the CAA is an organisation at civil war with itself. There seems to be an enormous problem based around personalities and interest groups within the organisation which reduces the effectiveness and capacity of the Civil Aviation Authority to perform its duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a major problem. It leads to personality clashes and leadership problems. We have seen these problems created over time. We have seen the opportunity to make changes along the way. Some of the changes which have come before us are reflected in the legislation which was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), to which he referred in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of personnel changes have occurred since this process began. The most obvious one is the departure of the former chief executive officer of the CAA, Doug Roser, and the departure of the former head of the directorate of aviation safety regulation, George Macionis. Whilst my colleagues on the safety inquiry would agree with me that many of the problems of the Civil Aviation Authority hinged on personalities, we have seen some personnel changes there. But it goes beyond those people who have already left. It has been put to us that if we are to see the new organisations&mdash;CASA and AA&mdash;established and working effectively we have to see a marked change in the culture and attitudes of those people who switch across from the CAA to the two new organisations which are tasked with the job of overseeing safety in the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people say there is no point in introducing new legislation bringing administrative changes, unless the attitudes of those people change and change dramatically. That is where leadership plays an important role. The new head of CASA, Mr Leroy Keith from the United States, is already in Australia. He has been here since the end of March. A great deal of hope and expectation rests on his shoulders as people look to him to provide the much needed leadership that the CAA lacked. As we have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), Leroy Keith will be assisted by a small but, we hope, expert and effective board, but a great deal of expectation and hope rests on their shoulders. I for one&mdash;and I know many others&mdash;sincerely hope that Leroy Keith and his fellow board members are successful because, in the end, it is in everybody's interest that they are. It is in nobody's interest that they are not successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will continue to act as a watchdog over the operations of the new organisations&mdash;the CASA and AA&mdash;as I have done for quite some time now over the old CAA. I think I have proven to anybody interested in the subject that I have a capacity to find out what is going on, regardless of the wishes of people with contrary views. I will continue to be vigilant. I hope that others associated with this industry will also be vigilant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that one of the industry organisations, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, has undergone a considerable change in recent times. A new leadership group has taken charge of that organisation. I sincerely hope that they prove to be an effective watchdog and keep an industry eye on the operations of both CASA and AA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the unintended consequences of all these changes and revelations about aviation safety in Australia has been that the leadership of AOPA has changed as a consequence of all the public focus on aviation safety. A new and vigorous team, led by Dick Smith and his senior vice-president, Boyd Munro, is now actively engaged in stamping their mark on aviation in Australia at the moment in a way that we have not seen before. They have been very active and very persuasive in their lobbying activities. Aviation desperately needs an effective, capable and a fearless watchdog to speak out on issues of concern when it comes to aviation safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They need to be fearless because the track record of those who have spoken out in the past shows that people have been subject to persecution by the organisation that they have criticised, whether they are members of it or members of the aviation industry. For example, in my case, my actions have led the CAA to attempt to sue me and to silence me from saying what I have been saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA is an organisation with a proven track record of being prepared to attack people who speak out against it. That is why we need a fearless voice to keep a watch over what goes on. I believe the whole purpose of my activities over the past nearly two years has been proven worth while, and the proof of that is in this legislation before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the legislation that is before us today. Those of us on the Morris committee have had a chance to look through this legislation in some detail. We did it in the company of members of the industry who gave us their considered opinions about what changes needed to be made to the original legislation. I believe that was a very helpful and useful process. It pleased many of those people in the industry to be given the opportunity to participate in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the recommendations which the committee made and which have now been presented in the parliament by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Shortland, have been well considered by the committee and those in the industry. I am pleased to see that so many of these recommendations have been picked up by the government and added to its list of amendments. It is a good process which should be undertaken on other occasions when we have bills of this nature before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principal changes that the Morris committee put forward which was not picked up in its entirety relates to the main objects of the bill. The committee felt that it was necessary to enforce the views that the committee and people in the industry had about what the main objects of the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority should be. The main objects of the bill that we put forward in our recommendation specifically referred to an `economical and effective' way of operating the authority. It also referred to more people being able to benefit from civil aviation. That last aspect&mdash;that is, more people being able to benefit from civil aviation&mdash;was dropped by the government, and you have heard the parliamentary secretary's reasoning for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the purpose of our making that recommendation on the main objects of the bill was to reinforce the need to undertake a careful scrutiny of the costs of anything done by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority versus the benefits. It is always one of the major bugbears that people in the industry have that CAA does not always often carry out what you would call a rational cost benefit analysis of everything that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of one of the amendments that we will be moving today is to ensure that the CASA obtains the maximum safety dividend from every decision that it makes. The next amendment that we will be moving is (3)(1)(a), which reinforces the same point yet again. I want to make it quite clear that in that amendment we use the expression `economical and effective'. I am sure anybody who would look at these things would say that you could hardly get much of an opposition going to an amendment which asks an authority like this to be `economical and effective' in the way it carries out its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also use the expression `promotes and fosters aviation'. When we use the word `promotes', we do not mean that CASA should set up a promotions division. The use of the expression `promotes and fosters' is designed to reinforce the message that we have to get as many people enjoying the benefits of aviation in this country as possible. Despite the accidents of late, aviation is still a very safe form of transport in this country. The amendment is designed to ensure that everything is focused on maximising safety by increasing participation in the industry and, therefore, increasing the viability of operators, which in turn improves their capacity to operate in a safe manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our next amendment deals with clause 57&mdash;subsection 20A (1) and 20A(2). As the parliamentary secretary said in his speech, this has been an issue of some debate over recent times. The government's original legislation changed the old legislation to introduce the word `potential'&mdash;the potential to put at risk a person's life or the potential to put at risk a person's property. The parliamentary secretary has pointed out that, on the advice of the Attorney-General's office and on the urging of the new Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association executive team, this part of the amendments to the old legislation has been withdrawn and the old section will be reinstated, subject to a review of the whole proposal surrounding 20A(1) and 20A(2) by the Morris committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an interesting way of going about it, and it is one that many of us can see has some value. But it is the view of the opposition, as it is the view of people in the industry, that we need to address this issue quickly and effectively. The amendment the opposition will be moving later today is designed to ensure that we maximise the safety value of CASA operations and that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is in a position to adequately and appropriately prosecute people who are offenders and who put people's lives and property at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's amendments, which relate to putting the life or property of another person at risk, duplicate the regulations in other countries. We have an amendment which is exactly the same as the United States, the UK and New Zealand. Those countries have been operating an amendment similar to the one we propose to move for many years and have found it to be effective in running successful prosecutions, maximising the resources of the safety regulator to protect public safety and maintaining the respect of people who operate within the industry for the safety regulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that our amendment to subsections 20A(1) and 20A(2) will reflect not only the words used for the same purposes in other countries but also, almost identically, the words used in the ICAO agreement. Chapter 3.1.1 of the general rules of the ICAO agreement in annex No. 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An aircraft shall not be operated in a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger life or property of others.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the substance of the amendment the opposition will be moving today. It is part of the ICAO general rules and part of the responsibilities of the Civil Aviation Authority of old and CASA of new to actually pick up. The whole purpose of ICAO is to ensure that safety regulations are compatible from country to country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not been compatible in this particular aspect of safety regulation with ICAO. We could say, `That is fine. We don't have to adhere to every single word of the ICAO general rules.' But if a country chooses not to take up an ICAO general rule or safety regulation, there is a provision for it to do so by giving notice to ICAO that it chooses not to take up that particular regulation. CAA Australia has not chosen to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are wrong on both counts. We have not picked up the spirit of the ICAO regulations, as exhibited in annex 2 of its general rules, and we have not notified ICAO of the fact that we have failed to do that. What the opposition is proposing in this amendment is a reflection of the rules and regulations of ICAO&mdash;an organisation of which Australia is a leading member and an organisation with which we have a signed convention that commits us to the implementation of ICAO rules and regulations unless we otherwise give notice of not intending to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the amendment that the opposition will be moving later today is a key amendment&mdash;one which we believe shows that Australia has not been living up to its commitments under this international convention and that Australia has been allowed to fall behind in safety regulation standards that other countries have been enjoying. I know the concerns about this regulation and this amendment centre on the ability to prosecute, and I know that the government, people in the department and people in the industry are keen to ensure that this aspect of the bill&mdash;subsections 20A(1) and 20A(2)&mdash;gives the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority the maximum capacity to undertake prosecutions and to undertake them successfully.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience in other countries proves that, if the amendment that the opposition will be putting forward is adopted, this will be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter here from a United States lawyer, Mr Yodice. He has been general counsel to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in the United States for the last 35 years, defending pilots against prosecution by the FAA. He will tell you that the FAA is successful in between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of all of its prosecutions, that there is no concern about the way this part of the regulation works in the United States and that it is the most used regulation for the purposes of prosecution. Therefore, what we are proposing in our amendment has been used successfully and frequently in countries such as the United States, as exhibited by the letter I just referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we adopt this amendment, it will give the Civil Aviation Authority the opportunity to direct its resources to the areas where they are most needed. Indeed, if you listened to the evidence put before the Morris committee, the Monarch coronial inquiry and the Seaview judicial inquiry, you will realise that one of the great problems that the Civil Aviation Authority has confronted in the past has been a lack of sufficient resources, despite some glaring deficiencies in the way airlines operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment quite unambiguously tells the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority that its first and foremost priority is to protect the lives of the travelling public and to let pilots be responsible for their own actions so long as they pose no risk to another person's life or another person's property. We believe this amendment will save the lives of innocent people. So we think it is an important amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be proposing some other amendments, and I will foreshadow those in the concluding moments of my speech. The amendments relate to ministerial directions. We would like to see ministerial directions tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days of their being given, rather than, as proposed by the government, their being published in the annual report of the relevant authority. We believe it will promote good and open government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have some amendments to the Air Services Bill that relate to the tabling of Airservices Australia's corporate plan. We believe again that this is important for good and open government. They are some of the amendments that we will be moving later in the debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the key amendment we will be putting forward recognises the need to make Australia's air safety regulations compatible with those of ICAO and of other countries that have adopted a similar amendment&mdash;an amendment which in those countries has been operating successfully, and is the most used regulation, in prosecuting people who offend against their air safety laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, at the end of the day, the passage of this legislation will prove that those people who were killed on Monarch flight 301 just on two years ago this weekend did not necessarily lose their lives in vain; that the subsequent fallout and changes that have followed from the crash of that Monarch flight have led to the saving of lives of other people in other commercial airlines around the country since that date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate and to indicate my support for the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill and the Air Services Bill which are now before us. At the outset, let me express my appreciation to the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) for the very great effort that he has put into the inquiry into aviation safety, which we are conducting. His contribution and that of the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) have helped to provide consistency and a very solid base to the work that we have been carrying out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After listening to the member for Hume I am disappointed with some of his remarks, I will come back to them later. He has played, and is playing, a very valuable role in this work that is being adopted on a bipartisan basis. Having unanimously endorsed the report brought to us&mdash;and I understand this is the way things work sometimes and I understand the difficult position he finds himself in&mdash;he now has to make some presentation to the House on behalf of his colleagues. I know from discussions across the table that his heart is not really in it. He has to present those cases and those words. I am sure he would agree with me, and by the way he smiles at me now I know that what I am saying is correct. We understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I repeat that he is a very valuable member of the committee. The parliament and the aviation industry are fortunate to have a solid core of members conducting this most important inquiry. There can be no more important inquiry into public transport safety than the inquiry that we are conducting. It is the first opportunity for people who have lived for years, for decades, to make a clamour about the aviation industry and push their own particular barrow when making allegations. It is the first opportunity they have had to be able to provide evidence to support the allegations in that clamour. I am sure, more than I am disappointed, that in many cases they have not been able to substantiate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our task is very much about sorting the oats from the chaff&mdash;that is, what are the substantive problems; in simple terms, what is the best system for Australia; and how ought it be paid for? That is virtually the brief that we have been given in the reference from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us is seen as essential as it puts into place two new authorities, which time and circumstances demand must be established from 1 July. We understand that those new structures may well go into place, but there is an expectation that the legislation may be modified subsequent to the receipt of our report and the report from Justice Staunton and his commission of inquiry into the Seaview tragedy. On page 11 of our report, we refer to what the Department of Transport said in a submission to the committee when inquiring into this legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One should not expect the establishment of CASA to be the only cure for the problems that beset the administration of aviation safety in Australia. The Department of Transport recognises this. The government may amend the legislation following consideration of the recommendations in the aviation safety report from our committee and the outcome of the commission of inquiry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry is being conducted by Justice Staunton. The bills before us were the subject of an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As the member for Hume said, that is a new process. I would like to underline, as I said in my tabling statement, that it is a very healthy process. Not all legislation lends itself to this kind of treatment but on issues like this where there is a wide public interest, and a wide public priority, you can be sure that the organisations being established and the legislation being examined go to the very heart of protecting the public in the use of transport services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the tabling statement, we mentioned the recommendations we were making to the government. I come before the House this afternoon confident that the treatment we gave to that legislation and to the report was correct and appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry thus far we have had more than 220 submissions; over 100 exhibits; 93 witnesses, with more to come; 16 days of hearing, with more to come; and almost 8,000 pages of evidence. Departments like the Department of Finance have yet to give evidence. We have had various committees, groups and associations come before us and they have all made contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that when you look at the whole area of aviation safety, the starting point is not the regulations but the state of the industry. In many ways, it is very similar to the state of the shipping industry when we started the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry. In this inquiry we are looking at general aviation and commuter services. It must be remembered that this legislation is not about the operation of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association alone and it is not about general aviation alone, it is about all aviation services operated in this nation. The legislation before us provides for the whole industry and within that some of the lesser activities of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear from the submissions and the evidence that we have taken thus far that the industry is in oversupply in the general aviation sector. The general aviation sector has, with the exception of supplementary air licences and commuter services, to the best of my knowledge, always been a deregulated industry. Aviation safety requirements are set out in the legislation, but there is no economic regulation of the industry. There is free entry and free exit as long as you can pay the required fees and obtain the necessary licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told in Moorabbin a few months ago that if you have $800 in your pocket in the morning, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, we can have Hollis Airlines in operation this afternoon. It can be done that fast. You do not need a pilots licence because we were told that that would be fixed for you. That is the way the industry operates. That freedom of entry and exit is a factor in the oversupply. This oversupply within the industry means that we have too many aeroplanes chasing too little business for too little return. That generates pressure to cut corners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been told in evidence that there is selective observation of the regulations. No amount of bashing of the chief executives of the CAA, regional inspectors, flight worthiness inspectors, airworthiness surveyors or district flying operation inspectors is going to fix the problem. We have an industry, albeit a small element of that industry, that thinks it is quite all right to observe those regulations that it feels are appropriate to its line of business. If anybody questions what I am saying now, you only have to look at the transcript of our hearings in Brisbane on 7 April last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this issue of the observation of the regulations where the problem starts. The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by continuing instability within the management and leadership of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is very difficult for people to give their best day after day and week after week no matter what slings and arrows and abuse are directed their way from all quarters. They are totally unable to defend themselves. These are cheap shots by some people in the media and some people with vested interests in the industry. These are the things that we have become aware of&mdash;and I am sure the member for Hume agrees with me&mdash;during the inquiry. That is the observation we have made from the evidence that has come before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the regulations are stupid. Responsible regulators do not observe those regulations because they are stupid. I do not know of any other industry in this nation that operates in this fashion. We must remember that we are talking about a small segment of the industry, not the industry as a whole. We are talking about a sector of the general aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to the committee as though the instability in management and leadership is an infection that goes down the line and it is then exploited by people at the coalface&mdash;that is, those who are required to observe the regulations. This can result, as it seems it has, in variations in the application of regulations and responsibilities. A sector of the general aviation industry seems to be happier to be at war with other sectors of the industry and the Civil Aviation Authority than it is to work together to try to create a better performing industry&mdash;an industry in which there could be pride about its performance and an excellent public image generated so that it would attract more business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have noted some journalism and media performances in the general aviation sector. The industry seems to have lived for years&mdash;even decades&mdash;on conflict and generating conflict within the industry and about the industry, the regulators and the regulations. Everyone says that it is always the regulations which are to blame, rather than some of the participants, but most of the time it is a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view is that the industry would be in a much better state and probably much better off commercially if a lot more time was spent promoting the positive aspects and the achievements of the industry, rather than creating division, alarm and exaggeration. Much of the input from the general aviation sector appears to be from vested interests or from journalists in one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem in this area is that there has virtually never been any input from the people who use the services. I ask my colleague the member for Hume&mdash;through you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;whether he feels the same about this. I know that it was very difficult to find a point of view or a submission from a passenger. There is no passenger association or organisation that has a voice for the people who pay for the services at the end of the procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the problems that organisations like the Civil Aviation Authority have had, and the CAA's successor will have the same problem. They have been trying to guess what it is that the public wants. I see that as being a very valuable role for our committee to play. I know that members of the committee have sought to think along the lines of what is right for the passenger and what is the public entitled to expect in terms of safety and efficiency standards from services within the industry. That is something we have to be vigilant about&mdash;especially as we conclude our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor that grows out of that is that the bureaucrats sitting in the middle get bashed. They are asked questions along the lines of, `How could you possibly let this happen?' The minister gets the same. He is asked, `How could this possibly be allowed to happen?' So regulations get tighter, things get tougher and the bureaucrats build more and more rings of defence around themselves, until we get to the point where there is over-regulation and over-rigidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch quickly on the section 20A amendment, which will be moved later by the member for Hume. I am puzzled about this, and I will relate the circumstances to the House so that honourable members are fully aware of what happened. When the committee was asked to look at these two bills, we invited what we believed to be all interested parties&mdash;including the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association&mdash;to make a submission. It did not make a submission. Its vice-president was in the audience at our public hearing on 26 April, and we exchanged some courtesies and nice words to each other after the hearings were over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that AOPA did not have this information available to it at the time. I am at a loss to understand why my colleague the member for Hume, for whom I have great respect, is now being asked to move that section 20A be amended; rather than, as the minister decided, referring the matter back to our own committee for consideration. I have confidence in the honourable member's judgment and his investigative capabilities. His colleagues also ought to have confidence in his investigative capabilities, his performance and his contribution to the work of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section deals with an area which was put to us a number of times during our inquiry. We questioned the CAA about the number of prosecutions&mdash;that is, how well it was doing its job&mdash;and we found that there were very few prosecutions, relatively speaking. When we followed that on, the answer we got was that it was difficult to get the evidence required for the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate an action. The DPP then referred that to the minister and the department, and the amendment that came forward is the amendment to the bill, which is now going to be proposed to be deleted and the matter referred back to us for examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand the process that takes place here. There is a defect in the existing legislation. It is difficult to put into practice. The process then is that the minister gives drafting instructions to parliamentary counsel. Parliamentary counsel&mdash;the lawyers that they are&mdash;drafts the legislation. The legislation is before us; it is parliamentary counsel's version of words that are appropriate for the task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step is that it is being questioned here. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) provides some other advice. One, I think, Laurence Gruzman QC provides some other advice. I suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that however many lawyers you ask for advice will be the number of different views you are likely to get. Given the special circumstances of that clause and its importance, the most appropriate course is to send it back to us to be looked at in the continuing activity of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that section 20A does not conform with the ICAO convention&mdash;in particular, paragraph 3.1.1 of annex 2 to the ICAO convention. The ICAO convention deals with international civil aviation. Whilst Australia adopts standards contained in the convention as Australian law, it is not obliged to do so. Section 20A, while not in strict conformance with annex 2 of the convention, does not place Australia in breach of its international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really puzzled that suddenly this matter&mdash;a matter that was not raised by any of the major operators in the aviation industry in this nation who participated in our inquiry into the legislation&mdash;is now raised at this late hour and put forward as a matter of great urgency. I am afraid that I cannot accept that. It has been there for a very long time. It did not suddenly become a matter of urgency in the last 14 days upon this advice from Laurence Gruzman QC being secured; it has been there for a long time. That legislation does not put us in conflict with convention, and it is peculiar to Australia. But we know that the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has carried out a vigorous campaign during the last few weeks about that section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has acknowledged some of those concerns which have been raised in relation to the amendment. That is why the minister has decided that it be referred to our committee for examination and report to the parliament. What we will have to do is strike an appropriate balance between the public interest in preventing dangerous flying, on the one hand, and the legitimate needs of the aviation sector, on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, when all those in the aviation industry in this nation&mdash;except for those people who fly because they love to fly&mdash;do not have any problem with the legislation, we will have to be convinced about why there is suddenly such an horrendous problem for those who love to fly and not for all the major operators in the airlines who really are the great bulk of the aviation industry in this country. That is not to say that those who love to fly should not be listened to. Yes, they have to be listened to, but it will be done in a context of all Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on that basis that we will be looking at this. I would like to invite everybody who has a view about it to make a submission to the inquiry, particularly the larger organisations and some of the lesser organisations in which private fliers and pilots are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US legislation has been referred to, and it has been said how wonderful that legislation is. That legislation is suitable for a US climate of civil aviation and private flying. It is a totally different climate in legislative terms, commercial terms and general environmental terms to the climate in Australia. Certainly, it is vastly different in terms of the climate in relation to the industry itself and where each of the sectors of the industry fits together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look forward to that examination of legislation that is ahead of us. I believe that it is the most appropriate course to be followed by the government. I am sure that, when we come back, we will have had a chance to have a good look at that, with the interests of all parties in clause 20A of the legislation before us having been adequately dealt with and the interests of all aviation best served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations that were made by the committee, we believe, received excellent treatment from the government in that most of those recommendations are being picked up. There was, as we understood, very considerable detail given to how the government treated them. We look forward, as a committee, to the same positive reaction from the government when our final report comes forward, hopefully, later this year. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better illustration of the shame of the Labor Party in this matter than what we have read in today's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. Mrs Sarah Milera, one of the central figures in the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair, came out in an interview with the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> yesterday and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the "women's business" was fabricated after it became obvious a legitimate claim based on two archaeological sites, including a burial ground, was not enough to convince the Federal Government to stop the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This woman is of particular significance. Most of you will not know this because you will not have been told this by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who has not got the decency to turn up today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will be familiar with Cheryl Saunders's report. In her report she basically used two sources as the foundation for her support for the secret `women's business' claim. One of those people was Doreen Kartinyeri and the other was Sarah Milera. What Cheryl Saunders said about Sarah Milera was that Sarah perceives herself and is accepted by others as a custodian of the law of the land. She spoke of Dr Fergie, the anthropologist, who argues that `Sarah's experiential spiritual knowledge provides a complementary emphasis on the particular significance of this area in Aboriginal tradition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point here is fundamental&mdash;Mrs Milera was a crucial figure in supporting the Tickner case, if you could call it that, to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge.

She has been supported by her estranged husband, who yesterday wrote to the minister&mdash;and you will be pleased to know this letter was copied to others, such as the Premier of South Australia and the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

<PARA>They are pretty damning words from Mr Milera but, above all, they are damning words for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. These are words that must ultimately lead to the resignation of that minister. That minister has been exposed as being grossly irresponsible in the fulfilment of his duties. He is a man, supported by the rest of the government&mdash;not least the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon)&mdash;who has set Aboriginal person against Aboriginal person. That is a pretty deplorable record for a minister for Aboriginal affairs to boast of, which no doubt he does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These interviews, this evidence, are in my view and in the view of this side of the House extraordinarily damaging and damning. The minister's record in this whole affair has been a very bad record in many other respects. One of the respects in which his record has been bad is revealed by the judgment of the Federal Court judge Justice O'Loughlin. Justice O'Loughlin said that the minister had failed to properly consider the representations that were made to him. He said that as a matter of probability the minister did not give any consideration to the representations at all. It is quite clear that the judge was right and the minister was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has not been listening to a large number of Aboriginal people in South Australia on this affair. He has been ignoring them. Indeed, it is perfectly obvious that he made up his mind to ban the bridge long before he said he made the decision to ban the bridge. We ought to think about this. The minister said he made the decision to ban the bridge at 11.15 on 9 July 1994. The minister said that he had a phone call with Dean Brown, the Premier of South Australia, and that in that phone conversation they discussed the bridge and the minister had, as the minister himself admitted, not made up his mind as to whether to ban the bridge or not at the time of that phone call. That phone call finished at 11.08 and the minister made up his mind at 11.15. So in seven minutes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. In doing so, there are many other reasons why this censure motion should be brought forward and why the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should come into this House and answer these questions.

Why does he not come in here and say, `I knew because Doreen wrote me a letter, yet I chose not to pass that information on to my reporter Cheryl Saunders'?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the minister not come in here and tell us why he did not give discovery of documents to his opponents, when he was using the might of the Commonwealth against the citizens of that Commonwealth? If he had nothing to hide, why would he not have given discovery? He does not have to give discovery in a judicial review, as we know; but, when discovery was asked for on three occasions and six FOIs, every time that was resisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has he not chased up the people who have come out in the last few weeks: Dorothy Wilson, who was there at all of the meetings; Dulcie Wilson, 63 years old; and Bertha Gollan, 75 years old&mdash;very respectable people? Why has nobody been to see them? They are very senior Ngarrindjeri people, much more senior than the source of the information, Doreen Kartinyeri. Why has nobody been to see them? Do you know why? Because it just might be that this thing is a fabrication and a hoax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now quite clear, as Doug Milera has said again this morning, that the women's business is all fabricated. You might say: who is he? Who is Doug Milera? Doug Milera is one of the litigants against the Chapmans in this Federal Court case. He is not just somebody who has walked in off the street; he is one of the litigants. Who is his estranged wife? She is quoted by Professor Cheryl Saunders in her report as being one of the two people who are seminal to the whole of the women's business&mdash;that is, Doreen Kartinyeri and Sarah Milera. Both of them have now said, `It's a hoax.' There are not going to be many left by the end of next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this time the minister simply refuses to answer these questions. For example, did it not occur to him that this was overturning 140 years of anthropological history? Did it not occur to him that his reporter had never been near the Adelaide Museum, the greatest repository of anthropological information? That has been confirmed by the director of the museum. It has now also been confirmed by the senior anthropologist, who said last Friday, `Well, sometimes these ideas blow in from the desert.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the minister refuse to pay compensation to the Chapmans? Here is the might of the Commonwealth being used against citizens who are investing money in this country, and all of a sudden the minister says no compensation. On the other hand, he was writing to ATSIC at the very same time saying, `If we get sued successfully or we have to compensate the South Australians, just tell us whether you will pay us some money because the Prime Minister and the cabinet want to know how much it will cost'&mdash;not whether the women's business was true but how much it will cost. He says, `So we will break the people down there'&mdash;my constituents&mdash;`and then when we have done that we will make sure that, if somebody has to pay, ATSIC has to pay because, after all, don't forget they were one of the protagonists in the matter.' This minister will not come in here. He himself should be censured. He should resign because he has not answered any of the answers in the last three weeks. My guess is that he will not answer them because he knows that, if he does, he will have to resign. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware of any recent international commentary on the government's Working Nation employment and training initiatives? How does that commentary rate Working Nation in terms of meeting the needs of Australian job seekers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1392" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The OECD has commented very favourably on the Working Nation statement and other initiatives of the government. I will read to the House some of the appropriate quotes. This is what it said at page 62:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's measures involve a far more comprehensive strategy of active labour market assistance with close linkages with education, training and skill enhancing measures than has ever been attempted before in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It silenced the talk of the jobless recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a package which will, in a relatively efficient way, help ease the difficulties the long-term unemployed have experienced in obtaining a job.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's measures, including substantial expansion in the number of entry level training places and the introduction of the training wage, are intended to improve Australia's skill base and hence the growth potential.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It applauds its initiative on competition in the provision of case management, as was seen through the innovative initiative in opening up that area for competition.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same document which those on the other side label a failure. Some failure! In terms of the international recognition of what has been achieved here, that is what the OECD had to say. But that is not what the opposition has to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we heard the Leader of the Opposition deliver his so-called headland statement. What did it say about employment and training initiatives and Working Nation? Absolutely nothing. At least The Things That Matter&mdash;and I see the former Leader of the Opposition has already left this place&mdash;allocated the first chapter to employment and education. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: is that an indication that these things no longer matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was nothing in the headland speech on skill formation and training. There was nothing on the Working Nation, despite the fact that members on the other side of the House are going to their area consultative committees and coming forward with initiatives under Working Nation saying that they would support it if they got back in office. Where is the commitment to that in the so-called headland speech?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do see a reference to the opposition being prepared to resource voluntary organisations to look after the unemployed. In other words, if they got into government they would give up; they would hand the lot over to the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence. They would give them no guidelines in terms of the direction that they would expect them to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we do use those organisations already. We use them and accredit them through the Employment Services Regulatory Authority to help us in terms of getting unemployed people, the long-term unemployed in particular, back to work. Those opposite say that they will resource them but they do not say how. Those organisations, and many other programs, are currently being resourced under the Working Nation initiative. There is not one mention of that in this document, despite the fact that the OECD has endorsed it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts say they are concerned about the battlers, and well they might. The only people who have been battling of late are those who have been trying to put a policy together in the Liberal Party. They failed in this statement last night. It is a headland in a haze with no lighthouse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Leader of the House. I ask whether he is aware of comments made by Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the Chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, who has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would really like to see the government promote and support a grassroots discussion on the issue of our constitutional arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The republic shouldn't be something handed down from on high. We the people should decide what we want.</PARA>
<PARA>Why will the Prime Minister not give Australians a people's convention so that all options about our constitutional future can be examined? Why is the Prime Minister so determined to give Australians the republic he wants rather than let them have the constitution they want?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1393" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition leader loves a throwaway line. He ought to know, and indeed the Australian public knows, that nobody can give to the Australian people a constitutional change that the Australian people do not want. The Australian constitution cannot be changed to create a republic, to change federal-state relations, to put in a bill of rights or whatever unless a majority of people in four states decide that that will happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing the Prime Minister says tonight is capable of being implemented without a full and total discussion with the Australian people when, at the end of the day, they will either give it the thumbs up or the thumbs down. That is the end of it. There is no possibility that the Australian people can have foist upon them the republic that they do not want. That is the sort of glib suggestion that the opposition leader has put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition leader tries to turn his process into a policy. He did a deal of policy pinching in the remarks that he made yesterday. Virtually any area of substance in the remarks that he made yesterday was a policy pinch. The proposition that we should have a people's convention happens to be one that he has stolen from the unfortunate member for Mayo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are risks with a people's conference. The risk is that a people's convention could rapidly come to be seen as a very expensive fraud. Unlike the people's conventions of the 1890s, it would not take place in a policy vacuum or in a structural vacuum. The people's conventions in the 1890s were formulated against the background where the Federation of the Commonwealth of Australia did not exist. There was no process therefore for them to determine the shape and structure of a constitution and no process for them to amend that constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They had to determine a constitution of their own. They started with conventions and ended with a constitution. The subsequent amendment of that constitution requires a process. The process starts not with a people's convention because it has no constitutional standing; it starts in the federal parliament. The federal parliament determines whether or not a referendum will be put to the Australian people. The referendum is then put to the Australian people and they determine the constitution they want. The constitution the people want is not determined for them by a people's convention, it is not determined for them by the federal parliament; it is determined by them when they reach judgment upon it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk you have with a people's convention, which would be enormously expensive to get together, is that at the end of the day you have a set of recommendations which, if they are going to be of any effect whatsoever, must be accepted and passed through the parliament for the purposes of a referendum. The parliament will decide what is put to the Australian people not anybody else and then the Australian people will decide whether they will have it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever merits you might think lie in this proposition for a people's convention, we know that the origin of it was not respect for the thinking of the average Australian and it was not a concern that the average Australian needed an opportunity to put forward suggestions to change the constitution, it was an attempt to get out of a divisive debate within the Liberal Party. That may have merits from your point of view, but the problem you have within the Liberal Party is not necessarily a problem for the rest of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before you go down the road of trying to convince people around the place that somehow or other they are going to be capable of determining a change in the constitution by an elected people's convention, consider the fact that you have the potential to create a very expensive fraud. As for the Prime Minister's views and the government's views about what proposition on the republic ought to be put to the Australian people for discussion and their determination, I suggest you wait to hear the Prime Minister's remarks.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amongst other things, the Leader of the Opposition claimed, `Existing taxation and welfare provisions disadvantage sole income families who have decided that one parent should be at home whilst children are very young.' That statement is completely false, in so far as having any supporting argument put forward. It is based on the maximum amounts payable under the child-care cash rebate compared with the home child-care allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if we look at what is paid under those provisions, we see that the average amount paid under the home child-care allowance exceeds the average amount paid under the child-care cash rebate. In aggregate terms, around seven times as much is paid in the form of the home child-care allowance than is paid through the child-care cash rebate in each  financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more fundamental point is that this sort of analysis completely ignores the very substantial amounts paid through the family payment system&mdash;separate from HCCA and the parenting allowances. That amounts to some $6 billion a year, with the inclusion of the new maternity allowance which will come in next financial year. Those payments are targeted on the basis of income. By virtue of the fact that they are targeted on the basis of income, a much higher average level of benefit goes to single income families than to dual income families. In an earlier question, I quoted the specific numbers on that. It is overwhelmingly the case that family assistance goes predominantly to single income households.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system of assistance is about to be very substantially enhanced from July this year, with the introduction of the new parenting allowance. The introduction of the parenting allowance in aggregate terms means that the total amount being paid on assistance to families will increase by around $400 million a year. I would have thought that that was a pretty good commitment for families. That comes into effect next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is very much targeted to families that could be reasonably described as battlers&mdash;if that term has any meaning at all. Low income, working households&mdash;there are around 120,000 such families&mdash;stand to benefit to the tune, on average, of $117 a fortnight. This is an average of $117 in additional benefits which is going to be provided to these battling, low income, working households. I would have thought that was a pretty substantial commitment which builds on the very considerable measures we have already made. This new payment will subsume, absorb and enhance the existing home child-care allowance, which was itself a major improvement on what it replaced&mdash;that is, the with-child dependent spouse rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure that comes into effect from July is a much better income test structure for this payment. The old home child-care allowance imported into the social security system the income test that previously applied to the with-child dependent spouse rebate. This meant that people could earn only $10.80 a fortnight before the taper cut in and they started to lose the entitlement. Under the new income test, they will be able to earn up to $60 a fortnight before the income test cuts in. So it is a vastly superior income test arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, we have gone from the with-child dependent spouse rebate to the home child-care allowance. The home child-care allowance meant that some 55,000 low income, working households got a significantly enhanced benefit because they did not have enough income to benefit fully from the tax rebate. It is a much more flexible system that enables people to enter and exit the work force. From July we will be enhancing that with a much higher level of assistance targeted to low income working households and a much superior design of the income test, which will be much more conducive to people putting forward work effort. So this is what this government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we have had from the opposition in the Cape Barren speech are some platitudes about assistance to families. What it has singularly failed to do is come to grips with just exactly how such assistance would be delivered and how any possible assistance&mdash;whether it be through the tax system or the social security system&mdash;can be reconciled with its objective of tightening up, very considerably, on government outlays. It has an incoherent vacuous position, and nothing that was said last night in the Cape Barren speech does anything to rebut that proposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to media reports today concerning the plight of Australian families.

Is the government intending to take additional steps to assist Australian families?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1395" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent budget was fundamentally focused at locking in sustained economic growth, ensuring ongoing job growth, keeping inflation low and ensuring downward pressure on interest rates. Basically, all those propositions advance the interests of Australian families and, indeed, all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some specific measures in the budget. One of those measures is that families will benefit from a number of measures, such as targeting of child-care assistance; an extra $17 million to support women caring for children with special needs in 36,800 families; an additional $10 million over three years for carers of frail older people, the chronically ill or for people with disability. Included in the budget too amongst the measures to assist families was a proposition to spend some $24 million over two years for the childhood immunisation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do notice, in what was referred to as the Cape Barren speech, given last night, that there was some mention made of a childhood immunisation program. Little bits of vignettes, tiny little elements of policy popped out of that speech. The only problem with the tiny little elements of policy which popped out almost unobtrusively from that speech was that they happened to be our policies. So out popped childhood immunisation as the one health initiative in the speech, while everything else that we did on health was given a big tick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also popping out from the speech last night was a policy for a committee of audit, a commission of audit&mdash;as I mentioned yesterday&mdash;which went through with a set of specifications exactly the same as I named in the House yesterday. That set of specifications popping out just happened to be covered by actions of this government in their entirety. So there are little bits of policy popping out every now and then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we were doing, as far as families are concerned, was building on in this budget. And, of course, there were moneys in this budget for a substantial number of additional support measures that have caused families to find themselves in this situation. Their real household disposable incomes&mdash;in part, because of the social net underpinning that they have been given&mdash;have increased by 40 per cent since we have been in office. The additional family payments since we have been in office are up 150 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister who answered a question previously pointed out the implementation from July this year of a parenting allowance, where some 115,000 low income working families will make an average gain of $59 a week. Those are things that have been done in the budget, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what sustains the bulk of a family income is not what appears in the budget, but that can be absolutely critical to an advance in its standard of living. What underpins family income is what goes on in the wages system of this country&mdash;whether an ordinary battler in society can be effectively protected by the wages system from any conceivable exploitation&mdash;and what underpins that is awards. What underpins that is a capacity on an enterprise basis to collectively bargain. That, more than anything else, sustains family income in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you draw out from what the opposition had to say in that Cape Barren speech not policies but tendencies, you find two tendencies. One tendency is that the public spending to GDP ratio that forms the underpinning of the social safety net must be carved back. That is there implicit. The other tendency is that the wages system, which underpins the capacity for wages to deliver things like overtime, holiday leave loadings and a capacity to underpin via the award process a wage structure at all, is quintessentially the new policy. It is a continuing old Liberal policy but a policy at least that is not being implemented by this government; that is, the capacity to knock over wage justice for the average Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the press commentary this morning, I thought one of the most effective expositions of this was by Tom Dusevic. I conclude with a paragraph that I think is worth recounting. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet there is a danger for Howard. At some point he'll have to outline beyond the rhetoric of last night why things will be better for families under a Coalition government. Voters will want to hear how a deregulated labour market will produce better outcomes. And they'll want to see a firm commitment to the social safety net, the great equalising mechanism in our society.</PARA>
<PARA>What a wonderful expression: `the great equalising mechanism in our society'. The opposition discovered battlers one week ago. In that one week they sought to belittle the social safety net, which we have been talking about for a very considerable length of time. They have got darned unlucky because their very belated interest, compared with our 10 years of interest, has actually coincided with a quite substantial piece of decent new analysis in the academic communities, think-tanks and commentaries on the social safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whereas we have been routinely blackguarded over the last five or six years on that issue, there is now a serious, detailed, decent, academic and well-structured analysis going on of what is meant by the social safety net. Unfortunately for the opposition, this coincides with precisely the point in time when they decided to persist with a challenge to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a great expression Tom Dusevic had for it: `the great equalising mechanism in our society'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing Professor Gregory's work, he makes reference to the situation in the bottom one per cent of suburbs and his basic unit of account there is the census collection district, which is 200 to 300 households. It is important to bear in mind that in this country around about 5 1/2 per cent of the dwelling stock is accounted for by public housing. Over the last 15 to 20 years or so, there has been a major shift in public housing policy towards targeting public housing at those who are right at the bottom in terms of income distribution. That represents a major change, and I can give you a whole raft of figures on that if you like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of that is we have seen a compositional change in the sorts of people who live in public housing. It is now much more the case that people in public housing are unemployed, on sole parent pensions and so forth. To the extent that that occurs and you get a compositional change in the bottom one per cent&mdash;when a wage earner moves out of public housing accommodation and is replaced by an unemployed person or an unemployed couple&mdash;obviously that means the income of that household is going to fall. I discussed this with Professor Gregory and he agreed and accepted my analysis of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the opposition has been grossly misquoting Professor Gregory's work. The reality is that, if you are talking about people who depend on the social safety net, there is no question that their situation has improved very significantly under this government. It went backwards under you. If you are talking about people on low wages, say, two-thirds of average weekly earnings, there is no question that their disposable cash income has improved as a result of the improvements in the safety net. Such people, if they are in private rented accommodation, would be around about $88 a week better off than they were under you in real terms. That does not include the great enhancements in the social wage that have been made, particularly child care, education, health and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those four elements of the social wage, according to Professor Harding at the University of Canberra and the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, are worth on average for a couple with two children around $200 a week. What has happened to those social expenditures under this government? Take health&mdash;expenditure has increased by 180 per cent. Take education&mdash;expenditure has increased by 40 per cent in real terms. Take child care&mdash;expenditure has increased by a whopping 495 per cent. These are all in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means is that the total social wage expenditure has doubled in real terms. That represents a real increase of 73 per cent per head of population. That follows a significant real decline in social wage expenditure per head of population under the coalition. It is, as I have said repeatedly, the case that in this country, as throughout the developed world, earning disparities have increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is the case also, as I said in answer to your previous question on the last sitting day, that those disparities are far less in this country than they are in virtually all developed countries bar the Scandinavian countries.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. This government is very proud of its industrial relations record and its industrial relations reforms. I remind the House that since the introduction of the Industrial Relations Reform Act there have been about 2,300 certified agreements in this country covering almost 60 per cent of workers covered by federal awards. The most pleasing aspect is that the duration and quality of those agreements have been steadily improving. The speed of enterprise bargaining, as you would be aware, continues apace, also under the guise of enterprise flexibility agreements. At the same time, though, through the operation of the award safety net and the no-disadvantage test, workers' rights and entitlements to decent wages and conditions have been protected via legislation. Also, the level of industrial disputation remains at historically low levels as real unit labour costs have decreased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that record and despite the soothing words of the Leader of the Opposition, he still maintains that there is great work to be done. The trouble is that in his policy-free speech of yesterday he does not tell us what that great work ought to be. Let me suggest what it might be, though. It appears that the Leader of the Opposition is still suggesting that he would place great reliance on individual contract employment and that he would rely on awards to fade out of existence within a few years. As an individual left their job and went to another job they would lose the protection of awards and move onto a single contract employment. That means that the very struts underneath our system of awards and the no-disadvantage test would be kicked away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian workers will ask of the opposition: will they keep Australian awards secure, relevant and up-to-date, to make sure that they underpin any enterprise bargains or indeed contracts, and will they make sure that the no-disadvantage test that we have written into our act remains integral to the system and maintains its integrity? These are two questions that we will continue to put to the Leader of the Opposition from now until election day. The integrity of our system is based on the security and the integrity of awards and the no-disadvantage test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is also the matter that they seem to be cocky about recently of unfair dismissals. The reason why we have increased the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth in the area of unfair dismissals is simply that we are sick of workers being sacked unfairly. There are a whole lot of examples that I would like to give to the House&mdash;but we do not have time&mdash;whereby it needs to be reported that there are people who are cruelly treated by the employers in this country and who need the protection of federal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example. Recently there was a case where a man was employed as a school bus driver. One day he complained about an aggressive guard dog kept on the premises where the buses were parked. Other people had also complained about this dog. A week later, while getting a bus ready to be taken out the man was attacked and bitten by the dog. He attended a doctor who gave him a tetanus injection. The man's employer saw the attack but did not speak to the employee about it at the time. When he returned from his round the employee spoke to the manager about the attack, saying that he felt unable to continue working while the dog was present. The manager said that the employee would have to go because the dog wasn't. That is the position of that employer. He sacked the worker but not the dog.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you just hang on and listen, I will tell you about that later. I thank the honourable member for his question. The pilgrimage to North Africa and Europe for VE Day commemorations by a group of 10 Australian veterans was very successful, as many Australians would be aware due to the intense media interest that was shown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can advise the House that I have arranged two additional pilgrimages during this important commemorative year, to Papua New Guinea and to Borneo. In selecting the destinations of the three pilgrimages, no judgment has been made concerning the relative significance of the associated campaigns over those that will not be included. It is just not possible to include them all. Rather, I have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in terms of Australia's involvement in World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilgrimage to Papua New Guinea will sail from Sydney on 29 June on a Russian cruise ship. There will be approximately 120 veterans on board, an ADF ceremonial contingent, a medical team and media representatives. The ship will sail via Brisbane to Port Moresby, then to Milne Bay and Oro Bay, with side visits to Kokoda, Rabaul, Buna, Gona and Sanananda; and also to Lae, with side visits to Wewak and Madang&mdash;returning to Australia on 11 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major commemorative ceremonies will be conducted at the war cemeteries at Bomana, Lae and Bita Paka. Other ceremonies and events are planned for Milne Bay, Kokoda, Popondetta, Buna, Gona, Sanananda, Wewak and Madang. Mr Ted Kenna VC, who is the sole surviving army VC winner of the campaign in New Guinea, will be on board this pilgrimage. He will be taken back to Wewak where he will unveil a plaque at Mission Hill where he won his VC on 15 May 1945.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilgrimage to Borneo departs on 5 July to visit Jakarta, Balikpapan, Tarakan, Sandakan, Kota Kinabalu, Labuan and Singapore. Ceremonies will also take place at each of these locations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 35 veterans will participate in this pilgrimage and will include at least one survivor of the death march. Given that a large media contingent will be travelling with both pilgrimages and the interest shown in the previous pilgrimage, I can state quite confidently that there will be an appropriate focus on the role of Australians in the war against Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of both pilgrimages have been selected and written to. I will be releasing their names closer to departure date, as medical considerations may dictate that the list may not be finalised for several weeks.</PARA>

I must admit that at the time I did get a little emotional, but I have to say that it is very hard not to get emotional when you are on Anzac Cove at Gallipoli. That day we had with us 13 pilgrims who would give their eye teeth if they could go back and experience again today what they experienced that day.</PARA>

Ted Kenna lives in Hamilton, which is in the middle of my electorate. Hamilton has held a number of special occasions for him in the last month. My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. Recently I was approached by the exasperated owner of a small trucking company who had taken on a young woman as a new office manager. In her three months at work, the woman was absent for 11 days without producing a medical certificate, and on many other days arrived late and drunk. After being given five verbal warnings, the woman was dismissed, with two weeks pay in lieu of notice. Despite this, she was still awarded $2,500 after her case was judged an unfair dismissal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that. Don't be silly. I referred to a previous example, as well you might have heard. The fact is that we have not changed the law in Australia on dismissals. We have taken into the federal arena the ability to hear cases where people previously did not have coverage. We have given a remedy to people who did not have an adequate remedy.

Since that time, Labor has increased the total number of jobs by almost two million. Do you know what the Leader of the Opposition achieved as Treasurer in five years? He achieved 262,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been interesting to do a bit of research on the background to these two pieces of legislation that are now before the House&mdash;that is, the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Air Services Bill 1995. Effectively, these bills are splitting the functions of the former Civil Aviation Authority into two separate bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an action that the government is belatedly taking. I think many commentators&mdash;not just from our side of politics or from this side of this House, but people generally who have been interested in air safety, air travel and air safety regulations for a number of years&mdash;have been pushing for this. We on this side of the House believe that the responsible minister, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), has been a little slow in moving to bring this legislation on to accommodate these changes. We agree with the majority of changes. The shadow minister earlier today highlighted a few amendments that the opposition is going to deal with at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the purpose of this legislation. Both these bills were referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I suppose it is worth while commenting briefly on the fact that, on a number of occasions, the government has referred legislation to House of Representatives committees or joint standing committees for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the main features of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Civil Aviation Act to establish the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a Commonwealth statutory authority. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says that the separation of the regulatory and service provider functions will ensure that aviation safety regulation is not compromised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from this, the bill has three major characteristics. Firstly, the CASA bill attempts to describe the purpose of aviation safety regulation and the functions of CASA; secondly, the bill increases the powers of the minister; and, thirdly, the bill transfers civil aviation regulations into this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Air Services Bill is to establish Airservices Australia as a government business enterprise to provide Australia's national airways system. AA's functions will include the provision of facilities to permit safe navigation of aircraft, provision of air traffic services, an aeronautical information service, an aviation rescue and fire-fighting service, an aviation search and rescue service, aeronautical communications, and specified aviation environmental activities and regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, the purpose of these two bills is certainly to separate the commercial activities of what was the Civil Aviation Authority from its very important safety regulatory activities. As I also said at the outset, a number of different organisations, commentators and people around Australia who are interested with air safety have been promoting this for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the government bringing this legislation before the parliament now? I think two very strong and important reasons for the introduction of this legislation are two extremely serious air accidents which occurred over the last couple of years. First, there was the crash of a Monarch Air Piper Chieftain near Young on 11 June 1993. While there was much media comment regarding the cause of the crash, the BASI report of the investigation was not released until July 1994. The report found that the cause of the accident was controlled flight into the ground. It also found a number of defects with the aircraft and inspection procedures, and concerns with the operator and the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the major aircraft defects were that the autopilot had been removed for maintenance and had not been refitted by the time of the flight. Also, the absence of the autopilot rendered the horizontal situation indicator inoperative, which was particularly important in the low cloud weather conditions that prevailed at the time of the accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inspection program for the aircraft was found to suffer from a number of defects. One was that, when informed that the autopilot was unserviceable and that repairs had been delayed, the CAA, at Monarch's request, issued a permissible unserviceability approval, PUS, that was valid until 16 May 1993 to allow the aircraft to operate, subject to conditions&mdash;including that two pilots be on each flight. A permissible unserviceability approval is intended to be an interim measure until a defect is rectified. The PUS applied only to the inoperable autopilot and not to other instruments. A further PUS was issued on 14 May 1993, as the autopilot had not been fixed. Again, the PUS related only to the autopilot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aircraft underwent a regular maintenance check beginning on 31 May 1993, during which the autopilot was removed for repair. The engineer carrying out the check on the instruments and electrics, on a subcontract basis, noted that the horizontal situation indicator and autopilot had been removed. He was unable to complete the check as the horizontal situation indicator had been removed, although the check could be completed without the autopilot as this was covered by the PUS. The engineer requested to be informed when the horizontal situation indicator had been replaced so that the check could be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 June 1993, the engineer checking the instruments and electrics learned that the aircraft had departed. He was informed by a Monarch engineer that the HSI had been refitted and tested by a radio engineer and a pilot. Consequently, the engineer inspecting the instruments and electrics certified his work. This was after the aircraft had been returned to service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that at the time the BASI inquiry was being undertaken, and when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure was also inquiring into the circumstance of that particular crash, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was undertaking an inquiry into GBEs. That inquiry included the Civil Aviation Authority as one of the government's major government business enterprises. The terms of reference for this inquiry by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, whose report was ultimately tabled in this parliament as report No. 336, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>, state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 16 June 1993 the Committee resolved to conduct an inquiry with the following terms of reference:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To inquire into issues raised by the provision of goods and/or services on a commercial basis by Government agencies, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the efficiency, effectiveness and appropriateness of corporations as a means of service delivery to the public; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the accountability of commercialised Government agencies and the mechanisms needed to ensure their accountability.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While not limiting its scope, the Inquiry will focus on three Government agencies:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Civil Aviation Authority; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the Federal Airports Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>A major part of that inquiry was into the efficiency, effectiveness and appropriateness of the Civil Aviation Authority conducting its business as a government business enterprise. Some of the evidence of a lot of the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority was certainly very interesting in terms of looking at the modus operandi of that department&mdash;whether they were looking at the imperatives of air safety as opposed to those of complying with the government's requirements in undertaking their commercial activities in returning a dividend to the government and how that prejudiced the implementation of air safety in Australia by the Civil Aviation Authority. Report No. 336 of the JCPA stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes, however, that, until recently, the Department of Transport (Transport) had not recognised that separation was also needed for the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) dual functions as a commercial provider of aviation services and an air safety regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of this Inquiry, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Civil Aviation Act 1988</EMPHASIS> required the CAA to provide services to the aviation industry and to regulate it. At that time, the CAA was classed as a GBE because it charged for most of its services. However, its main function was regulatory. At a public hearing, the CAA's Chief Executive Officer described the Authority's roles in the following terms.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I highlight to the Committee and the public that the CAA has two very distinct roles. We are first and foremost a safety regulator. We regulate the Australian aviation industry to achieve high levels of safety. That is a requirement under our Act and we also provide services to the Australian aviation industry. . . . our safety regulation functions account for about 10 per cent of our staff and about 10 per cent of our budget. The service side of our business, which is the provision of aviation services such as air traffic control, rescue and firefighting services and technical support, is about 90 per cent of our budget and business.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The opening comment of the CAA's chief executive officer, Mr Roser, was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are first and foremost a safety regulator.</PARA>
<PARA>But safety regulation made up only 10 per cent of the operations of the CAA and 10 per cent of the budget of the CAA. That evidence was given on Friday, 20 May 1994. I think the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) spoke about what means the CAA had at its disposal, as far as forcing compliance of safety regulation is concerned. We took evidence from representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;and bear in mind that that public hearing took place after the Monarch crash and prior to the Seaview Air crash. I asked both Mr Roser and Mr Macionis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the compliance officers, you are basically the policemen of the aviation industry. In your total budget for 1993-94, how much was set aside for compliance and prosecutions?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Roser responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not prosecute.</PARA>
<PARA>So for recalcitrant operators in the aviation industry, putting innocent people's lives at risk, Mr Roser stated, `We do not prosecute.' Mr Macionis interrupted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, technically Mr Vaile is quite right, and details can be found on page 12 of the booklet we gave you yesterday. Details of this are in the section relating to the administrative action of prosecutors. However, it is up to the Director of Public Prosecutions. We only submit briefs of evidence. In relation under-compliance activities, there are four items, which are planned surveillance, unplanned surveillance, advice on regulatory requirements, and prosecution and administrative action. That makes up a total of about $24 million or $25 million out of the $58.4 million . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting point is: they do not prosecute. As one of the travelling public in Australia who buys tickets and travels regularly on aircraft in this country that are regulated and checked by our safety regulators, under the Air Services Bill, I hope that these checks are enforced much more stringently than they used to be. From the evidence that was taken at the BASI inquiry, the equipment that was missing from the Monarch aircraft was missing for in excess of 100 hours while that plane was operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unbelievable to think that those people who lost their lives in that crash boarded that plane in Sydney with the expectation that they were going to arrive safe and sound at their destination. One would think that regular transport operators have the imprimatur of the Commonwealth government on their activities and their operations, that they have been checked out, that they are safe to travel with. That certainly was not the case. It certainly did not come across that way in the evidence we received at the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when we looked into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important recommendation in report No. 336 was recommendation No. 4, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance should coordinate a review to examine all agencies with regulatory and commercial functions, with a view to separating these functions.</PARA>
<PARA>This is for very obvious reasons. Hopefully, with the legislation that is being discussed in this place today, we are going to see a major improvement as far as air safety in this country is concerned. I certainly hope so. It has been highlighted on a number of occasions that this action could have and should have been taken a long time ago, certainly immediately after the Monarch crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence we took from Mr Macionis and Mr Roser indicated that everything was hunky-dory, that everything was sweet in the garden, that there were no problems and that these people were being checked out. Yet they were being allowed to fly. At the time I think the shadow minister, the member for Hume, highlighted the possibility of some problems with the next regular transport operator that ran into strife, Seaview Air. That was after this inquiry, which was after the Monarch crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it took those two major aviation catastrophes in this country to bring this government to where we are today, to realise that its process of reform, which I think started in 1988 with the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority, was not working. There were not the checks and balances. There were not the controls. The commercial imperatives had taken over from the safety imperatives. Management was confused as to whether the lives of the travelling public in Australia&mdash;who were boarding planes under the perception that nothing was likely to go wrong because the planes were operated with the stamp of approval of the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;or the commercial imperatives of providing government with a dividend or running to a budget were more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hark back to some of the recommendations in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that a number of areas of government operation in this regard certainly need review. There are some core activities of government that nobody is going to argue against hiving off or commercialising&mdash;get them out there, separate them, let them stand on their own two feet and make sure they compete properly on a commercial basis with the private sector. But there are certainly areas that should remain as government agencies under the direct control of the line agency or the government department so that they can be suitably funded by the Commonwealth of Australia to ensure those safety aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major discussion has taken place as to whether portfolio ministers should also carry responsibility, as the taxpayer's representative, as the shareholder&mdash;the only shareholder with responsibility to GBEs. This highlights the point that a number of us on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts have discussed at length&mdash;that those responsibilities should be separated. The portfolio minister, the minister responsible for establishing the regulatory control over these organisations, over these GBEs, should not also be the minister responsible for their commercial activities, who sets the height of the hurdle when it comes to the dividend that must be provided back to government. There is a conflict of interest there. Ultimately this country will follow other countries around the world which have gone down this path and will separate those responsibilities. This case with the CAA highlights the fact that the portfolio minister should not be the minister responsible for extracting dividends. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with many of the remarks that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), made. Throughout most of this current saga of the CAA I have agreed with many of the things that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has said, particularly in relation to the Monarch Air matter. In September 1993 during an adjournment speech about noise abatement at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport I said to the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next 12 months I will be paying particular interest to this organisation, working to ensure that it is made accountable to this parliament and to the public, including the people of my electorate, whose lives the CAA, in cahoots with the Federal Airports Corporation and at the industry's bidding, have so consistently disrupted&mdash;and more seriously&mdash;unfortunately, at times potentially threatened.</PARA>
<PARA>In those remarks I was referring to the current Civil Aviation Authority. I said on that occasion that this abrogation of accountability by the CAA to the government and the parliament and its lack of regard for regulations had to cease. At that time I was responding to an article which had appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning-Herald</EMPHASIS> in August 1993 where the CAA admitted that it was systematically authorising breaches of regulations. The CAA admitted that it had authorised breaches of noise abatement procedures to accommodate industry imperatives during what it termed `peak periods'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the CAA covered up for the FAC figure fiddling on the impact of the third runway. As members will recall, on 18 November 1994, another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> revealed that the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;again conspiring with the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;had deliberately set out to mislead the public about the impact of the third runway. Civil Aviation Authority documents confirmed that they knew that the FAC noise contour maps and statistical projections in the environmental impact statement were wrong. What did it do? Nothing. It said nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidents like these, I believe, were serious breaches of the duty of this authority to provide reliable information to the minister, the government, the parliament and the public. Unfortunately, the legislation at that time governing the Civil Aviation Authority did not specifically set out this requirement. These actions of the CAA were symptomatic of the deep-seated problems and culture of this GBE&mdash;a GBE that was out of control; a GBE that had a cowboy approach to life; and a GBE which, in many ways, acted according to its own agenda, and clandestinely did so in the name of what it thought were its corporate responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the CAA it was the best of all worlds. It could do what it liked and in the end had none of the responsibilities that a line department might have had for its actions. It had escaped the government after it ceased to be the old Department of Civil Aviation and was out there on its own unencumbered, irresponsible and uncaring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today is about ensuring that the government, which, quite correctly, is responsible for public safety, has the power to enforce strategies and regulations&mdash;putting safety and the community before industry concerns and, most important of all, something the opposition is having difficulty grappling with, above monetary concerns. The opposition's monetary bias to safety is no doubt stolen, as are many of its other policies, from someone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, those opposite still seem to be under the sway of the discredited former chairman of the CAA, Dick Smith. In 1990, when the CAA became a government business enterprise, the then chairperson Dick Smith said in the CAA annual report that there was a need to balance the cost of safety supervision. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasingly over the last 12 months the media&mdash;and therefore the community&mdash;have come to understand the complex balance between safety and cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result is that there is now less pressure to spend the limited amount of money available for safety as a reaction to newspaper headlines. The Authority's safety experts are now able to concentrate on areas where the best value is obtained for the safety dollar.</PARA>
<PARA>This ethos of valuing safety in dollar terms was, I believe, the wrong approach. I think subsequent events, such as the Monarch and Seaview disasters, highlighted just how wrong that approach was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Concerns over the CAA's safety performance had been expressed for a number of years. There was a need for action to be taken. In 1992 the government established a safety regulation forum which reported in August that year and raised a number of concerns. However, concerns continued, and in February 1993 the board's safety committee was requested by the government to examine the CAA's Safety Regulation and Standards Division. It is needless to restate how public concern came to a head following the fatal crash of the Monarch Air Piper Chieftain near Young on 11 June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a part of its investigations, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation investigated the role of the CAA. It reached a number of negative findings against this government authority, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The activities of the safety Division appeared biased toward promoting the viability of the operator rather than on promoting safety.</PARA>
<PARA>To my mind, this was a cultural change in the organisation which had occurred at the urging of the former chairman, Mr Smith. In my opinion, it was this cultural change of moving to affordable safety which led to less stringent safety checking. It is no good Mr Smith saying in the newspapers how there were no aircraft crashes when he was the chairman. That had nothing to do with him; it had more to do with luck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in this organisation is an ethos which has changed from stringent safety checks, which would result in the grounding of aircraft if they were unsafe, to allowing them to fly as long as they could get into the air. I believe that that ethos and cultural change occurred after the urging by Mr Smith that you could put a price on safety. It is a ridiculous proposition and one that the government is rejecting in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 July last year, after these disasters, the government established the Aviation Safety Agency within the CAA and initiated an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. Further concerns were highlighted again following the Seaview aircraft crash en route to Norfolk Island on 2 October 1994. That incident prompted the government to take a number of harsher steps, including the transfer of the then director of aviation safety and a judicial inquiry into the operations of the CAA independent of the ongoing House of Representatives inquiry. That inquiry is continuing. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) is doing a very important job with that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the firm belief that there are other people whom the committee ought to have a look at. I believe the committee should look at the New South Wales Air Transport Council, which is not very well known to members of the public or members of parliament. That body was set up by the New South Wales government quite some time ago. It exists to grant intra-state licences on behalf of the New South Wales transport minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can trace back the particular problems of Monarch Air to the decisions of the New South Wales Air Transport Council in the late 1980s and early 1990s to grant willy-nilly commuter licences in New South Wales which ensured that safety was the first victim of the cutthroat competition which developed between operators. We saw that happen on larger scales in the United States when deregulation occurred there. Some of the very significant safety problems which have shown up in New South Wales have been a result of that willy-nilly deregulation that that body allowed. That caused the Commonwealth, as my colleague said earlier, to put its imprimatur on it. Those licences to operate in New South Wales were granted by the New South Wales Air Transport Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the honourable member for Shortland has come into the House. I commend to him and his committee that they look at the New South Wales Air Transport Council to see what sort of role that deregulation had in what might have been avoided with Monarch Air and to find out how that council made those decisions. Were they at the behest of the New South Wales government, commuters or industry? What drove the council to change its policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most unfortunate outcome of that policy change was the fact that three operators were flying into a small town like Young. Anyone with half a brain would know that a small town like Young could not sustain that sort of activity. The only way those operators were able to keep themselves in the air was to slash things which in the past the Civil Aviation Authority would not have allowed them to slash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfortunate combination of the changed culture at the Civil Aviation Authority, which allowed inspectors to feel that they were under pressure to let people get into the air rather than keeping them on the ground, and this deregulation which occurred in New South Wales at about the same time meant that safety became the first victim. The people on the Monarch flight became the second victim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation we are debating here today will replace the CAA. I hope that, when the bureaucratic changes occur, the people who move from one authority to the other might leave behind some of the baggage that they have accumulated over the years. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will assume responsibilities for aviation safety regulations, while Air Services Australia will be the industry's service provider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other important things that this legislation does is to strengthen the hand of the minister. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority is directly accountable to the minister and, through him, this parliament. It is required to report to the minister, and the minister has the discretion to issue strategic directions as to the manner in which the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should perform its functions. I think that is right and proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with a number of these GBEs is that they have just decided they are a law unto themselves. They have become captured by industry groups. If ever there was an example of a GBE that has become captured by industry groups it is the old Civil Aviation Authority. Hopefully, this legislation will break that nexus and restore some accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will be required to take into account the views of the minister when performing its functions. A key aspect of this accountability to the minister and the parliament is the requirement of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to prepare a corporate plan each year. It seems to me that, since its inception in 1988, the CAA has always had difficulties in understanding that it was accountable to the government, the parliament and the people of Australia. Somehow it seemed unable to reconcile its obligations to the community, which paid a lot of its salaries, with its obligations to the industry. It seems that it thought its obligation to the industry and its commercial concerns were of a higher priority. The CAA saw this as being as flexible as possible&mdash;bending rules and putting corporate dollars before lives&mdash;to accommodate corporate imperatives, the imperatives of the industry that I believe it thought it should be serving rather than the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has come to terms with the CAA's problems for it, as it was unable to reform itself. We have separated the corporate from the regulatory responsibilities. By having that circuit-breaker in place, we think that at least might inject a little bit more responsibility into this organisation. So you will have one body focused on service delivery and the other appropriately resourced to develop and secure compliance with aviation safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's job will be to make sure that the flying public are given a safer approach to flying rather than having aircraft operators allowed to operate to keep their business going. One of the main gains from this initiative is that it places a central and unambiguous focus on safety. The baggage that these bureaucrats had from the Smith days should be jettisoned&mdash;and jettisoned quickly. There will be a much greater clarity in the delivery of the functions and much greater accountability and greater separate reporting to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a positive approach, and I hope those public servants will realise that they have an obligation to ensure that the future does not replicate the past. Even if the attitudes of people remain unchanged, I believe the legislation will ensure that public safety is given the priority it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has moved away from the idea of affordable safety and cost recovery, which Dick Smith talked about. I am sorry to see that the opposition is still going down that track with respect to cost recovery. But the government will increase its contribution to the administration of safety regulations by $11.8 million above the previous cap of $22.8 million, which will bring the government's total contribution this year to $34.6 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry and the travelling public will make a contribution, and that will be increased by $17 million, funded by an increase on aviation fuels of approximately 0.9c per litre, bringing the price of fuel to 2.38c after some reductions in fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taken together, the increased government and industry contributions represent a 39 per cent increase in the spending on aviation safety. An additional $1.6 million will be allocated to enhance the capacity of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation to examine aviation accidents and incidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will go a long way to getting Australia back to the reputation it used to have as one of the safest countries in the world in which airline commuters can safely take to the skies. We need to debunk the myths that Dick Smith sent forth about the wonderful job he did. We need to say to the people who are going to work for these two new organisations that they are getting a second chance and they must ensure that the interests of the travelling public are put ahead of the interests of the industry or we will be back where we started. That would have a detrimental effect not only on people from country areas who use small commuter operations but also on people in the larger cities to where they fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might sound cruel and unconscionable to say that while a Monarch disaster and a Seaview disaster were exceptionally bad at the time, imagine the effect it would have had if they had been going in the other direction. Both disasters are the fault of cultural change. There is no point trying to finger some poor inspector and say that he or she did not do the right thing. The reality is that this cultural change came down from the top of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might not find anything in writing, but the people at the coalface knew that the mood had changed. Their job was no longer to do ramp checks and stop these pilots from flying but to let them go if it looked okay. This legislation says that we are going back to the way it was. The safety of the travelling public is important, not the financial ability of operators. I think the authority and the House should take account of those matters. </PARA>

<PARA>I commence my remarks by thanking all the people who have participated in the debate to date. It has been an interesting exercise because virtually everybody in this debate has approached the legislation from the same point with varying degrees of passion. I thank the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) for the remarks he just concluded because, whilst he has some different views on a couple of minor points, he and I share sentiments about the outcome, the reasons and the need for this legislation to be introduced into parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the legislation, if it goes through the House and ultimately the Senate, will make aviation safer and will lead to lives being saved. It is for these reasons that we will move a number of amendments this afternoon. We believe our amendments will add additional force to the government's legislation to achieve that overall goal of making aviation in Australia safer. This amendment relates to the main object of the act and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`3A. The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation in an effective and economical way, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents whilst recognising the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation.'.".</PARA>
<PARA>This is a direct pull, if you like, from a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shorthand (Mr Peter Morris) and of which I am a member. The report was made to this House only last week following our deliberations in consultation with members of the industry. The members of the committee who deliberated during those hearings felt that was an appropriate set of words to outline the objectives of the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It was a neater, more effective, more comprehensive way of saying what was originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of the House who have been listening to the debate would know, the government has chosen to adopt nearly all of the Morris committee's recommendation, with the exception of the last few words&mdash;`whilst recognising the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation'. The opposition has proposed to include the phrase that was omitted by the government from the Morris committee's recommendation because we believe that, by encouraging more people to participate in aviation, it will ensure that anything that acts in contrast to that will not be undertaken by the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the accidents and problems of the CAA, aviation is a very safe form of transport when compared with driving a motor car, travelling on a bus or whatever. So, in the interests of safety, we want to encourage people to participate in civil aviation and in turn that will enhance the capacity of aviation operators to maintain their operations in a viable sense. If aviation operators maintain their viability, they are more likely to maintain their aircraft and flying operations in proper order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the amendment I have moved picks up the full intent of the House of Representatives standing committee's original objective as put to the parliament last week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has made it clear in his response to the Morris committee of 31 May 1995 that he is opposed to this amendment moved by the opposition. It is our belief that the amendment will dilute the safety intent of the new act by refocusing on the commercial interests of the industry. It will set up a dual mandate for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by requiring it not only to regulate aviation safety but also to foster the aviation industry. In that regard, we believe it will introduce uncertainty as to how the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should recognise the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment could be used to challenge the validity of safety rules on the basis that they may have an adverse economic impact on the industry. We believe that the proposal would also make the safety authority accountable to the industry, which is inconsistent with the committee's views as reflected in its report. In short, the proposal is likely to invalidate the government's major purpose in separating the service provider and the safety regulation functions of the Civil Aviation Authority and create a safety authority with a clear and unambiguous focus on aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry expressed concerns that the bill could be used as a vehicle to promote a policy of safety regardless of costs, but that is not the intention of the bill. As the second reading speech explained, the government decided that the industry concerns would be best addressed if the relevant provisions in the Legislative Instruments Bill were brought forward in their application to the safety authority. Those provisions provide for full public consultation and cost-benefit analysis of regulatory changes, and represent a clear and unqualified means of taking costs into account in developing safety regulations. The second reading speech indicates that the minister will issue a direction to this effect immediately the authority is established. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of the complaints that we have heard over time in our inquiry, and in my own investigations, is that the Civil Aviation Authority of old had lost its way, that its commercial function had overtaken its safety regulatory role. This had led to a deterioration in the standard of aviation safety regulation in Australia and in the standards within the industry. As a consequence, it had actually damaged the regard and/or respect that people in the aviation industry had for the regulator, which in turn led to people in the industry disregarding much of the CAA's actions and decisions. We all appreciate the need to focus as much as is possible this new legislation on the need for safety to be the primary role of this new Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we also have to remember that we are dealing with people about whom we cannot always be confident will be doing everything the way we want them to. We have seen examples in our inquiry, and again in my own investigations, of how the Civil Aviation Authority of old has often done things that have related to expenditure, or the introduction of new regulations, which do not take into account, or do not take regard of, the cost of those regulations or decisions. In effect, not regarding the costs involved in the end reduces the amount of safety in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, many people do not like using the term `affordable safety'. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and I have heard people saying in 1,000 words the very thing that affordable safety means without using the term `affordable safety' because it has become a term that many people do not like, and I can understand that. However, we have to recognise too that at the end of the day there must be a limit to the amount of money you can spend without prejudicing safety in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take an extreme example. The new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, in cahoots with the new Airservices Australia, may decide that it would be a damn good idea to put a full air traffic control system in at Wagga to control the three, four or half dozen commercial flights that come in there each day. One has to ask: is that a sensible allocation of the limited resources of our aviation industry when perhaps the same amount of money could be spent upgrading the radar system at Sydney airport, Tullamarine airport and any other airport, which have a greater number of commercial services going into and out of them and where many more people's lives depend on having an adequate radar system? We need to consider whether the dollars could be better allocated to another area to provide a better safety dividend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the opposition, and I know members of the committee, felt it was necessary to put into the wording of the legislation something that called on the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority to take into account costs and to have some kind of cost-benefit analysis. I am pleased to hear that the minister will, with the commencement of the new authority on 1 July this year, give a direction to the authority to ensure that any new regulations or any decisions that are made by the authority are accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives us some heart to see the sentiment of the opposition's amendment brought into effect. However, we make the point that, if the government is going to do that via a different means, why do we not do it via a direct means by having it worded in the legislation to ensure that it reflects what the minister proposes to do on 1 July and what the Legislative Instruments Bill will enforce from 1 January next year?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hate to think from the remarks of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) that anyone thought that the primary consideration in the performance of the duties of the CAA would be to ensure the viability of what could only be described as marginal operators. You may not have intended that meaning, but that could be construed from your opening remarks. I would not want to see a situation where that was the case. The suggestion that the survival or success of someone in the general aviation industry is dependent upon the fees they pay to the Civil Aviation Authority or CASA means that we have to deeply consider and evaluate our public priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to bear in mind that the House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure made one recommendation which has become the content of the amendment moved by the opposition. The opposition gave the government a choice to have a second objective. Most of that has actually become part of the amendment we have before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This needs to be seen in context of the next set of recommendations from the committee which will not only set out a broad objective for the authority but also set out specifically the classes of functions. Some of the government's other amendments point to an adoption of the committee's recommendations about the major and minor functions. They need to be read in context with the objectives. Therefore, there will be a simplified broader objective and a very explicit and streamlined description of the functions of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct those who have a doubt about the consultation process&mdash;and I recall our public hearing on 26 April where we talked with the industry about this section of the bill&mdash;to page 8 of the second reading speech where this is as explicit as it needs to be. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this bill, CASA will be required to put in place a mandatory consultation process before any civil aviation regulation is made to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunity to comment. CASA will also be required to prepare a Legislative Instruments Proposal which contains a summary of the proposal and its objectives . . . an indication of relative costs and benefits to government and the affected public of the proposal and alternatives and reasons for the preferred approach.</PARA>
<PARA>That is explicit; it is very clear what it is about. I think the two recommendations together cover the issue completely. There is no need for concern on the part of industry. It is probably tighter than what was originally proposed, because my colleagues and I&mdash;including the member for Hume&mdash;operated under the impression at that stage that the Legislative Instruments Bill was coming forward. We were not sure when, but it was to come forward at some time and pass through both houses of parliament. What the minister has done is give a directive to the new authority to behave as though the bill had gone through. I think that very much strengthens the position, and I am quite happy with the amendments as moved by the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish to clarify the issue raised by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) in his initial remarks. He made the comment that he thought I was in some way or another trying to say that we need to take into account marginal operators in relation to costs imposed by the CAA or the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority. That is not my intent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns I always had with Monarch Air, for example, was that the old CAA spent too much time worrying about the cost of its charges to Monarch and allowed Monarch to operate for much longer than it ought to without drawing it to a confrontation on the failure to pay its fees. For example, from November 1991 to the flight 301 Monarch crash on 11 June 1993, as I understand it, Monarch paid no fees to the CAA. Certainly, it did not pay a lot of its landing fees to some of the local councils that owned the airports that it used. Obviously, for those sorts of people, protection is not the answer. It is certainly not my intent, by putting forward this amendment, that that would not be so. I am sure the honourable member for Shortland understands that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the opposition and the government are taking a similar path in this regard. The government has chosen to go down the path of giving a direction to the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority to come into effect on 1 July. That will be, in a sense, superseded by the instruments legislation which will come into force on 1 January next year. That will require the new authority to undertake a cost-benefit type of analysis of everything it does. We do not argue with that view. We think it is a sensible way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing we are doing is wanting to do it directly in the form of the amendment that we have proposed, rather than doing it via a somewhat indirect path that the minister is putting forward. At the end of the day, the outcome will be the same. Our path is perhaps more direct, while the government's path is somewhat less direct.

<PARA>I think that amendment is fairly self-explanatory. We can hardly mount a major argument against using words like `economical and effective'. With any government owned organisation, such as this, where we as parliamentary representatives of the people of Australia are concerned to ensure the maximum benefit for the dollar, we could hardly argue with the inclusion of words such as `economical and effective' as a requirement of the manner in which the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority should perform its functions. I think it would be very difficult indeed to oppose such an inclusion&mdash;particularly of the words `economical and effective'. In addition to that we have `promotes and fosters civil aviation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would make these points: firstly, my colleague Senator Parer, our shadow minister for aviation, will no doubt be putting a more substantial argument in regard to this. However, it is important for us to recognise that the opposition is not, at any stage, proposing that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority engage in the physical promotion of civil aviation. We do not intend for there to be a promotions department set up within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. That certainly is not our intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of that would be that further revenues would have to be raised in order to pay for it or, alternatively, revenues from the existing revenue base would have to be drawn upon to pay for it. Of course, those are revenues that would otherwise be directed towards things such as safety surveillance. It is not our intention in any way, shape or form to diminish the capacity of the new organisation to undertake safety surveillance. For that reason we are not, in any way, shape or form, suggesting the establishment of some type of promotions department within the new CASA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply a statement reflecting the view that many people in the industry have been putting to me for a long time now&mdash;from as early as the middle of last year this view has been put to me by a number of people in the aviation industry&mdash;that is, it would be a useful adjunct to have an organisation, which is now CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, recognise the need within its operations to do whatever it can to assist in fostering the industry; to assist the industry to, if you like, remain viable; to assist the industry to encourage people to participate in it. I guess this is the basic sentiment behind `promotes and fosters civil aviation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again that it would be very hard to reject our first point `is economical and effective'. I imagine that anybody would find it difficult to put forward an argument that really disagreed with the need for any government facility or service to be anything else but economical and effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that we put this amendment forward, recognising that in so doing it again ensures that the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority keeps in mind the need not to waste money, not to redirect resources from the aviation industry into areas that do not achieve, to maximum effect, the overall goals of everybody in the aviation industry&mdash;that is, to maximise safety. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments are very significant and go to the heart of the problems that the Civil Aviation Authority has had in the past. In the original version of the government's legislation, the old wording was changed to include the words `potential to endanger the life of a person' or `potential to endanger property'. The government has quite sensibly withdrawn those original amendments to the old bill and reintroduced the old legislation with regard to subsections 20A(1) and 20A(2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this is simply to ensure that the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority places as its first and foremost priority the safety of people who are involved in commercial aviation&mdash;the travelling public. They are the people who buy a ticket to fly in an aeroplane and in the process put their faith in the system of aviation safety regulation in Australia and expect that system to have sufficient resources and sufficient direction to ensure that the sector of aviation that carries the paying travelling public is receiving the maximum safety surveillance and the maximum degree of regulation that is humanly possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time, unless we focus on the need to protect the life of another, we will fall back into the trap that the old CAA fell into; that is, directing an enormous portion, some 27 per cent, as indeed the old CAA did, towards regulating a sector of aviation which is not represented and used by the travelling public. I am referring to sports aviators, people like parachutists and gliders, and general aviation&mdash;the sorts of people who, if they do make a mistake, are only likely to endanger their own lives, not the lives of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we can focus and direct all of our energies and resources towards protecting the lives of other people and not trying to  protect people from themselves. We do not do it in other facets of life. For example, we do not do everything we can to stop people from abseiling in Bungonia Gorge in my electorate where three or four people are killed every year by falling as they abseil. We do not do it in other facets of life. What this amendment is designed to do is ensure that we focus all of our efforts on protecting the lives of other people who engage themselves in aviation and in the process ensure that we bring our regulation in regard to the protection of persons and property in line with ICAO. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendment that we propose is very strongly supported by AOPA and one which its members have taken a strong strand on over recent times. There has been, as I mentioned earlier in my speech today, a change of leadership at the AOPA organisation based around the sort of issue that we are talking of here in subsections 20A(1) and (2), which is the need to ensure that people in aviation have the regulator focusing the maximum amount of attention on people who provide a commercial service to ensure that we protect the lives of other people, rather than focusing an enormous portion of the regulator's resources on protecting people from themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no amount of regulation you can introduce to really protect people from themselves. The problem with the old CAA is that it spent too much time focusing on protecting people from themselves at the expense of protecting people in the commercial and regular public transport sector. Many people would say that one of the problems the Monarchs and Seaviews have highlighted to us is that the regulator was not focusing enough attention on those operations whilst at the same time was focusing enormous amounts of attention on those people who were really only likely to kill themselves, if they were going to hurt anybody at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, many lives were put at risk whilst the CAA was focusing on pouring its resources into a very small sector of the overall industry that, if anything was going wrong, was only putting the lives of the people who were actually flying the aircraft or jumping out of aeroplanes with parachutes on their backs at risk. In other words they were not risking anybody else's lives. So this amendment is designed to ensure that we can put our focus for regulation on protecting the lives of other people, not trying to protect people from themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us into line with international practice. One of the things we discovered in listening to people in the aviation safety inquiry is that many of the regulations are regarded with derision by people in the industry. Many of the old CAA regulations are simply unworkable; they contradict each other or they do not have the respect of people in the industry because they are seen to be ridiculous. One of the things that would enhance people's respect for the regulations is to adopt amendments such as the ones that the opposition is putting forward here today in regard to subsections 20A(1) and (2). This would be overwhelmingly supported by people in the industry. It would enhance their regard for the regulator and their regard for the regulations overall and, by so doing, increase the likelihood of people actually giving proper and due respect to the regulations and the regulator and complying with the regulations and the wishes of the regulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ensures that the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not waste so much of its resources on protecting people from themselves, that it reallocates those resources to protecting the paying customers of aviation, such as those who flew on the Monarchs and the Seaviews and who put their lives in the hands of the system, expecting the system to work properly to maintain safety. By doing that, I think we will fulfil the expectations of the travelling public. These amendments are designed to fulfil those expectations effectively, give proper respect and regard to the new safety regulator and ensure that people in the industry will voluntarily and enthusiastically adhere to these sorts of regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever I have heard a half-hearted contribution from a member of this House in support of an amendment, it is the one that has just concluded. In fact, the concluding remarks of the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) really constitute a very strong argument in support of the government view that this issue be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for much wider discussion, interpretation and report to this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association in its proper perspective. Its latest presentation is that it really represents people who love to fly. Well, lots of people love to fly. But there are over 60,000 licensed pilots in this country; about 10,000 of them are members of AOPA. That is quite proper. It is a very useful organisation to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reads the journal of AOPA, no matter over how long you want to go back you will find constant exhortations to people to attack whatever authority was responsible for aviation regulation. If you read the latest edition, there is an article which is well deserving of attention by this parliament. In it the readers are exhorted not to contact the CAA if they are in trouble in the air, because they are likely to be pinged. If you are in trouble, the last one you contact is the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think somebody really needs to look at the responsibility for the publication of material like that. We should not assume that all those 60,000 pilots are able, adept and of the highest level of competence. There are all sorts, and all with differing levels of competence, experience, nervous capability and judgment&mdash;and much of it is judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a proposal from the government which is the most reasonable one you could put. The government is saying, `Let's leave the law as it has been for the past 25 to 35 years. Just leave it as it is.' No-one has previously raised one issue about this clause. But, since one sector within the industry has a concern, the government has proposed to send that clause back to the committee&mdash;where it could have been raised before but was not&mdash;to have it examined to see whether the rest of those pilots, those other 50,000 pilots through the various organisations, are interested in this issue and whether there is really a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is indicating a preparedness to put it on the table of the committee charged with the responsibility to look at aviation safety matters so that it can go through the issue and report promptly to the parliament. We will do that. I certainly would argue that the members of the committee on both sides of the House have now got the competence and experience to do a good job on this, and a quick job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has been made to the United States. But the position in the United States is a bit different from what has been presented by AOPA. The AOPA provision is similar to the one which operates in the United States. We have said we are not prepared to adopt uncritically the AOPA provision without a detailed knowledge of the legal and judicial context within which the US provision operates. I mentioned in my speech on the second reading that you need to look at the climate and all the other factors that are involved, not just the words of the legislation. What is appropriate for the US climate, what is appropriate for the US environment, might be utterly inappropriate here. So you need to look at all of the factors involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the research we have had done on the United States situation, the advice provided to me is that the offence is a civil one enabling a licence to be suspended. As such, the burden of proof is a civil one&mdash;that is, on the balance of probabilities&mdash;rather than a criminal one where the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. The United States courts have been prepared to imply a concept of potential endangerment into the offence. This concept of potential endangerment, as contained in the initial amendment, was criticised by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. But the association cannot have it both ways. If that is the interpretation the US courts are placing on it by practice of the courts&mdash;even though the words are fewer&mdash;you cannot say you want the US model but not be prepared to have it clearly prescribed. So those words I have put to you really only point to the need for this matter to be best examined, and most competently examined, by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I say to the honourable member for Hume: when you made the comment that the CAA spent too much time protecting people from themselves when it should have been concentrating on commercial aviation, you made a comparison with abseiling. For heaven's sake, you cannot compare abseiling with flying; they are vastly different. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As always, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has put forward some views that are worth commenting on. People must recognise that, if these amendments are picked up by the government, it will not mean that the general aviation sector and the sports aviation sector will be totally neglected in terms of safety regulation and surveillance. The intent of these amendments is that those people will still continue to have regulation and safety surveillance imposed on them to ensure that they do not endanger the lives of other people. There will always have to be proper surveillance and regulation of that sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Peter Patroni, who was chairman of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association for 14 years, said it is ridiculous that his Mooney aircraft&mdash;his only aircraft&mdash;which has only one door into it and obviously only one door out of it could be grounded for the simple reason that it does not have an exit sign over the one and only door in the aircraft right next to his head. This is the extreme example that was pointed out to us by the former chairman of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here you have an overzealous regulator imposing grounding conditions on an aircraft which has only one door simply based on the fact that it does not have an exit sign over the one and only door in the aircraft. This is an example&mdash;it can be duplicated by other people with different examples&mdash;of just how overzealous the former regulator has been in the past. These amendments are designed to try to overcome that overzealous nature of the new regulator to ensure that the new regulator involves itself in matters that are really important and that it does not get involved in matters that are not important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AOPA amendment, as it has commonly become known around the House over the last week or two, is simply designed to focus the new regulator's attentions on giving the first and foremost priority to protecting the lives of others. It ensures that, if a sports aviator gets in there and undertakes a risky action, he is not putting at risk the life of another person. It seems highly reasonable for the public of Australia to expect the aviation regulator to be protecting the lives of innocent people. That is what this amendment is all about. It ensures that the focus of the new regulator is to protect the lives of innocent people and that it does not go to the ridiculous extremes that it used to under the old regulator of trying to protect people from themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Shortland did not like my example of abseilers in Bungonia Gorge, there are many other examples that he may find more suitable. The example that has often been used is that of rock fishermen. Many rock fishermen go out there and risk their lives every day. The net consequence of their taking a risk of their own life is that nobody else is likely to be endangered; they are going to risk only their own lives. We do not stop them from undertaking those sorts of activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to conclude this ping-pong that we are having across the chamber. As I said before, you cannot make a comparison between abseiling and flying. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), who is at the table, just said, no matter how you legislate&mdash;and people always set out with the best of intentions&mdash;the Civil Aviation Act is only partly about the people in the planes; it is very much about the people on the ground underneath the planes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The intention of the original legislation was not to protect the hoons&mdash;as they were perceived&mdash;who flew in aeroplanes back in the 1920s. It was to protect the people, later in the 1930s, who were worried that these people flying around in the air were doing a most unnatural thing; that they were operating in contravention of nature; and that human beings were not meant to fly, otherwise they would have had wings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be remembered in all of this that the legislation embraces all kinds of aviation activity. This legislation is not just about members of AOPA. This legislation covers all forms of aviation activity and all participants in aviation activity. I listened to the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) suggest that the activity of people flying around by themselves and enjoying themselves is as innocent as abseiling because you can only injure yourself. I draw to his attention some of the recent crashes where only the pilot was involved. I do not want to mention specific places, but he is aware of them because I spoke to him during the break about them. The legislation does not protect those people on the ground involved in pilot only crashes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation and that clause has sat there for 25 to 35 years. We are not convinced&mdash;and I certainly am not convinced&mdash;that there is suddenly a reason for urgency because somebody started a campaign and wanted to get some spurs, some notches, on their gun to show that they started this campaign and that this is what we can do. The extreme example the former president of AOPA referred to about the sign on the cabin is a ridiculous example. It was a ridiculous practice but, similarly, one could go to other locations and other similar events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what this legislation is about. It is substantially about the overall safety and protection of the travelling public and the protection of the people on the ground who could be injured by the operation of aircraft. All of these matters simply constitute a greater argument. I ask the honourable member opposite to join us in that. It should go back to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. We should get everybody who is likely to be involved together. Let us ask members of the public, who have not had a say in any of this yet&mdash;the customers, the people likely to be affected&mdash;and hear what they have to say, and the member for Hume, my colleagues and I can then bring a prompt report back to this parliament.

<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear. We recognise that, from time to time, the Minister for Transport may give directions to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. We believe that is a proper process for the minister to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) made a number of directions to the old Civil Aviation Authority, many of which people in the community would have strongly supported and which people on this side of the House strongly supported.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport may have enhanced his reputation by issuing those directions. In a sense, this amendment might further enhance his reputation by ensuring that the directions the minister has given the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority are drawn to the public's attention quickly and effectively by their being tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days of their being given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a step towards open, transparent and honest government. We do not see that any reasonable arguments can be put up against this amendment. In the interests of the public knowing what the government is doing in the vital area of aviation safety and its reasons for doing it, we think that this is a perfectly reasonable and legitimate amendment. It will ensure that, if the minister does make a direction to the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, within 15 sitting days the parliament&mdash;the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;will be properly notified so that the public can understand what the minister has been doing in the interests of public safety. We move this amendment knowing that there are no legitimate arguments against open, honest and transparent government. The amendment should be supported on the basis of open, free and honest government. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment has been circulated in my name and deals with the tabling of a corporate plan for Airservices Australia, under the Air Services Bill 1995. The opposition is of the view that the corporate plan of the new Airservices Australia ought to be tabled, upon its completion, within 15 sitting days of the minister receiving it. That is the thrust of our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the view from the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) will be that the government is not going to support this. His argument will be that this is commercial in confidence; that Airservices Australia, AA, is a commercial operation and, therefore, has commercial in confidence requirements that must be considered with its corporate plan and, for that reason, the corporate plan should not be made known to the public.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an argument I can understand the minister putting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I make this point: Airservices Australia is a government monopoly. There is nobody out there competing with Airservices Australia. It has a unique position in the commercial world, if you like. It is an organisation that is not subject to competition because all of the things that it does are a monopoly, a government legislated monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that light, I cannot see how any commercial damage could be done to Airservices Australia by publishing its corporate plan. This is an organisation that will be wholly owned by the Australian public. This organisation is solely for the Australian public's benefit, and I can see no reason why its corporate plan&mdash;outlining its purposes, its directions, the way in which it hopes to achieve those things&mdash;cannot be made available for public scrutiny.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is the Government's view that Australia's Head of State should be an Australian&mdash;that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001. Tonight I shall describe the means by which we believe this ought to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that to fulfil an undertaking given during the last election campaign, on 28 April 1993 the Government established a Republic Advisory Committee to prepare an options paper which would describe the minimum constitutional changes necessary  to  create  a  federal  republic  of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Republic Advisory Committee was chaired by Mr Malcolm Turnbull and comprised Dr Glyn Davis, Miss Namoi Dougall, the Hon. Nick Greiner, Dr John Hirst, Ms Mary Kostakidis, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, the Hon. Susan Ryan and Professor George Winterton. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to thank them. They consulted widely throughout Australia, carried out their work with dedication and energy and delivered to the Government and to posterity a most valuable document. </PARA>
<PARA>In the eighteen months which have passed since the release of the Report, the idea of an Australian republic has come to occupy a central place in our national political debate: not only in this Parliament but within the political parties, in major representative and community bodies, in schools and universities, communities at large and, I daresay, around countless Australian dinner tables. </PARA>
<PARA>In the process many Australians have come to favour a  Republic. Just as many, perhaps, now believe it is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA>Many may regret the prospect of change and be unsure about the means by which it can be achieved, but recognise that sooner or later we must have an Australian as our Head of State. That one small step would make Australia a republic. </PARA>
<PARA>Governments can wait for opinion to force their hand, or they can lead. They can wait for the world to change and respond as necessity demands, or they can see the way the world is going and point the way. </PARA>
<PARA>We are approaching the 21st century and the centenary of our nationhood. As never before we are making our own way in our region and the world. For us the world is going&mdash;and we are going&mdash;in a way which makes our having the British monarch as our Head of State increasingly anomalous. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that if the plans for our nationhood were being drawn up now, by this generation of Australians and not those of a century ago, it is beyond question that we would make our Head of State an Australian. Any suggestion that the British monarch would fill the role would not be entertained. This is not because our generation lacks respect for the British monarchy, or the British people, or our British heritage, or the British institutions we have made our own, or our long friendship with the British in peace and in war. On the contrary, Australians everywhere respect them, as they respect The Queen. But they are not Australian. It is so obvious, that if we were just now drawing up our constitution, we probably would not even feel the need to say that the Australian Head of State will be Australian&mdash;it would go without saying. </PARA>
<PARA>That it does not go without saying today is an accident of history. We are attached to Great Britain by long threads of kinship and affection which, to a considerable extent, are embodied in the warmth of our regard for Queen Elizabeth. Many Australians may well feel that to substitute an Australian for the monarchy constitutes in some way a rejection of these ties. I think all of us can understand these feelings. </PARA>
<PARA>But the creation of an Australian republic is not an act of rejection. It is one of recognition: in making the change we will recognise that our deepest respect is for our Australian heritage, our deepest affection is for Australia, and our deepest responsibility is to Australia's future. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in the creation of an Australian republic will alter the facts of our heritage and our affections. Indeed our relationship with Britain may well become the more thoroughly `modern relationship' which the British Prime Minister expressed a desire for two years ago. The development of a mature and modern relationship will certainly not be inhibited by recognition of the truth. We are friends with separate destinies to carve out in the world. We are not as we once were, in a parent-child relationship. </PARA>
<PARA>The people of modern Australia are drawn from virtually every country in the world. It is no reflection on the loyalty of a great many of them to say that the British monarchy is a remote and inadequate symbol of their affections for Australia. And we can be equally sure that in the 21st century the British monarchy will become even more remote from even more Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia occupies a unique place in the world and makes a unique contribution to it. Our destiny is in no-one else's hands but our own: we alone bear the responsibility for deciding what the nature of our government and society will be, what advantage we will take of our human and material resources, what kind of place our children will inherit. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not a radical undertaking that we propose. </PARA>
<PARA>In proposing that our head of state should be an Australian we are proposing nothing more than the obvious. Our head of state should embody and represent Australia's values and traditions, Australia's experience and aspirations. We need not apologise for the nationalism in these sentiments, but in truth they contain as much commonsense as patriotism. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a point worth making: this republican initiative is not an exercise in jingoism; it is not accompanied by the beat of drums&mdash;or chests. It asserts nothing more than our unique identity. It expresses nothing more than our desire to have a Head of State who is truly one of us. It changes nothing more than what is required to make clear and unambiguous our independence and responsibility for our own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a small step, but a highly significant one. The government believes that at this stage of our history it is a logical and an essential one. And it can reflect that stage in our history. An Australian Head of State can embody our modern aspirations&mdash;our cultural diversity, our evolving partnerships with Asia and the Pacific, our quest for reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians, our ambition to create a society in which women have equal opportunity, equal representation and equal rights. In this decade we have a chance which few other countries have; in declaring ourselves for an Australian republic, we can give expression to both our best traditions and our current sensibilities and ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA>At present, under the Constitution, Australia's Head of State is The Queen and her "heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom". Anyone reading the Australian Constitution who is unfamiliar with the practical realities of Australian government would assume that the role of the monarch was central. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the involvement of the British monarch in Australia's affairs is now very limited. The Queen's role as Head of State is in most respects carried out by the Governor-General. Of the responsibilities The Queen retains, the most notable is her appointment of the Governor-General which, by convention, she does on the advice of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not quite alone among the countries of the world in having as our Head of State someone who is not one of our own citizens, but we are in a very small minority&mdash;and a majority of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations are republics with their own Head of State. Of the 185 members of the United Nations, only 15 do not have their own Heads of State&mdash;and 14 of those 15 are former British Dominions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Queen of Australia is also Queen of the United Kingdom and 14 other countries in the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding that The Queen is Australia's Head of State and fulfils that duty conscientiously, when she travels overseas she represents only the United Kingdom. Her visits abroad often tend to promote British trade and British interests&mdash;they do not promote Australia's trade and interests. </PARA>
<PARA>This is, of course, right and proper for the Head of State of the United Kingdom. But it is not right for Australia. The right Head of State for Australia is one of us, embodying the things for which we stand, reminding us of those things at home and representing them abroad. We number among those things fairness, tolerance and love of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">this</EMPHASIS> country. It is a role only an Australian can fill. </PARA>
<PARA>Each and every Australian should be able to aspire to be our Head of State. Every Australian should know that the office will always be filled by a citizen of high standing who has made an outstanding contribution to Australia and who, in making it, has enlarged our view of what it is to be Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>In these and other ways, the creation of an Australian republic can actually deliver a heightened sense of unity, it can enliven our national spirit and, in our own minds and those of our neighbours, answer beyond doubt the perennial question of Australian identity&mdash;the question of who we are and what we stand for. The answer is not what having a foreign Head of State suggests. We are not a political or cultural appendage to another country's past. We are simply and unambiguously Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>If only by a small degree an Australian republic fulfilled these ideals then it would be worth it. </PARA>
<PARA>Measured against other stages of our development it is a relatively simple and modest undertaking. A hundred years ago, despite their rivalries and the enormous distances which separated them, the Australian colonies came together and created a nation. In the course of a century we have evolved from a collection of British colonies; to a single nation of limited independence; to a Dominion in the British Empire; to a sovereign nation in all respects bar one. In the same century we have come through great trials of our collective courage and ingenuity. </PARA>
<PARA>As Australian democracy and society have evolved and developed, the practical character of Australian government has dramatically changed. For example, in the 1930s the Governor-General ceased to be the representative of the British government in Australia and became the representative of the British monarch alone. In the same decade it was accepted that the British monarch would act solely on the advice of the Australian government&mdash;not the British government&mdash;in relation to Australian matters; and Australia assumed responsibility for its own external affairs which had been previously the responsibility of the British government. In 1930 for the  first  time,  an Australian  became Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>With the abolition of all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London, in the 1980s Australian courts became the ultimate arbiters of Australian law. Also with the passage of the Australia Act, the Parliament of the United Kingdom relinquished the last vestiges of its power to make laws applying to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In every instance, there was controversy. Today it is hard to imagine why the changes were opposed. </PARA>
<PARA>And we are all the better for the changes. In the 1990s we are stronger, richer and better placed in the world than ever before. At every stage in our development there have been hesitations, but in the end we have always recognised necessity and where our interests lie. If at times we have been cautious about taking large steps forward, it cannot be said that we have taken any backwards. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we seek with the republic: a small but important step forward&mdash;the last step in a process which began one hundred years ago. We think it is time to embrace the necessary change. </PARA>
<PARA>We therefore intend to ask the Australian people if they want an Australian republic with an Australian Head of State. </PARA>
<PARA>The change we propose has very limited implications for the design of Australia's democracy. It is the so-called "minimalist" option. All the essential Constitutional principles and practices which have worked well and evolved constructively over the last hundred years will remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that these proposals represent the Government's preferred position. We do not suggest that it is the only position and not open to change. But it is a position reached after careful consideration of the Advisory Committee's report, and we believe it to be a wise position that will stand the test of time. </PARA>
<PARA>"Commonwealth" is a word of ancient lineage which reflects both our popular tradition and our Federal system, and we propose that the Australian republic retain the name "Commonwealth of Australia". </PARA>
<PARA>Under the proposals the role of the House of Representatives and the Senate will remain unchanged, as will the role and powers of the States. We will still be a Federation. In virtually every respect, our governmental arrangements will be exactly the same as they are now: the day to day handling of national government will remain with Ministers led by the Prime Minister; the Cabinet will continue to deal with the major issues; and Ministers will continue to be responsible to Parliament and the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>Our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations headed by The Queen will not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA>None of these things will change, but we will have an Australian as our Head of State, and we propose that he or she be described by the term "President of the Commonwealth of Australia". </PARA>
<PARA>The President will perform essentially the same functions as the Governor-General. As with the Governor-General, except in the most exceptional circumstances, these functions will be carried out on the advice of the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>A former Australian Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, made some remarks last week which I think bear repeating. They echoed those of a predecessor of his, Sir Paul Hasluck; and in fact I should think they contain a sentiment common to every Governor-General since Federation. Sir Zelman described the Governor-General's role as "the highest single expression in the Australian governmental structure of the idea that all Australians from all parties and all walks of life belong to the same nation". </PARA>
<PARA>An Australian Head of State would perform precisely this unifying role; and, it follows, would need to be of the same stature and integrity as we seek in our Governors-General. </PARA>
<PARA>A significant element of the Head of State's role is symbolic; performing ceremonial duties around the nation and abroad. This is the public aspect of the office: the means by which the Head of State represents Australia and, by his or her example and encouragement, provides national leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>The Head of State will also continue to perform the formal administrative duties given to the Governor-General by legislation and which are undertaken on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. The Head of State's duties here include formalising government regulations and appointing public officials. </PARA>
<PARA>The Head of State will assume the Governor-General's constitutional duties, most of which are, by convention, performed in accordance with the advice of the government of the day. These include summoning and dissolving the House of Representatives and the Parliament as a whole and issuing writs for Federal elections. The Head of State will also take over the Governor-General's role as titular Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA>In line with actual practice, we propose that the Constitution be amended to make clear that the Head of State will exercise these constitutional duties on the advice of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Head of State will retain those very few powers now held by the Governor-General which, in the most exceptional circumstances, may be exercised without, or possibly contrary to, Ministerial advice. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the so-called reserve powers. The Republic Advisory Committee identified these powers as: the power to appoint the Prime Minister; the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and therefore the government; and the power to refuse a request by the Prime Minister to dissolve one or both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee made the point that there are a number of principles or conventions underpinning our Westminster style of government and the practical operation of our Constitution. These principles, which are not currently set out in the Constitution, determine whether the circumstances exist for the Governor-General to exercise a reserve power and what action would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Theoretically, it would be possible to fully codify or write down these conventions, assuming one could foresee all the contingencies they might be required to meet. I have no doubt that a great many people would like to see the Head of State's discretionary, or reserve, powers tightly defined&mdash;as they are, for example, in the Irish Constitution&mdash;so as to oblige the Head of State to act in accordance with express rules in the Constitution, or Ministerial advice, in all circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The question is, then: should the reserve powers&mdash;which are imprecise and governed by precedent and convention&mdash;be codified? Should they be delineated, cut down or specified precisely in our Constitution, or should they remain as they apply now, by unwritten convention?</PARA>
<PARA>The advantage of codifying the conventions, whether in whole or in part, would be to bring a degree of clarity and certainty to the options open to a Head of State in different situations. </PARA>
<PARA>However, after careful consideration, the Government has formed the view that it is probably impossible to write down or codify these powers in a way that would both find general community acceptance and cover every possible contingency. As the system evolves there needs to be some capacity to respond to circumstances quite unforeseen today. Tightly defined rules can themselves have unforeseen consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>Were we to try, by Constitutional amendment, to set down precisely how the reserve powers should be exercised by the Head of State, those amendments, even if intended to be otherwise, could well become justiciable&mdash;that is capable of being adjudicated by the High Court of Australia and required to be adjudicated by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence, codification would be likely to result in fundamental change to our system of government and alter the status of the High Court in relation to the Executive and the Parliament. Over time, Justices of the Court could well be drawn into arbitrating purely political disputes whose resolution should ultimately be in the hands of the electorate. The Court would thus be exposed to public pressure and, in the inevitable event that a party to a dispute was unhappy with its resolution, the standing and impartiality of the Court could be called into question. </PARA>
<PARA>For these reasons the Government believes that, on balance, whatever the immediate attraction of this course might be, it would not be desirable to attempt to codify the reserve powers; and that the design, processes and conventions at present governing their exercise by the Governor-General should be transferred to the Australian Head of State without alteration. </PARA>
<PARA>We are aware that, with this option, there is a risk that Australian governments may occasionally find themselves in conflict with a Head of State who exercises political judgment without regard to the conventions. We are also, of course, conscious of the possibility of a repetition of the events of 1975, when a government possessing the confidence of the House of Representatives was denied supply by the Senate. But the question of the Senate's powers over supply is a very different issue from that of establishing an Australian Head of State. It is an issue that deserves to be addressed, but it doesn't need to be addressed at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA>If these reserve powers are to be given to a new Head of State, it is critically important that the authority and source of the Head of State's power is consistent with the national interest and the continued effective operation of our political system. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been considerable debate in the community about how the Head of State should be chosen. As things now stand, the Governor-General is appointed by The Queen acting on the sole advice of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that most people believe the Prime Minister should not have such exclusive power in appointing an Australian Head of State. The debate is principally between those who support popular election and those who favour election by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The desire for a popular election stems from the democratic sentiment which all Australians&mdash;including all of us in this place&mdash;share. However, the Government has come to the view that if a new Australian Head of State were to be elected by popular mandate, he or she would inherit a basis of power that would prove to be fundamentally at odds with our Westminster-style system of government. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be recognised that a Head of State, whose powers derived from a general election, would be the only person in the political system so elected. His or her powers would be nominally much greater than those of all other Commonwealth office holders, including the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who are, without exception, indirectly elected via large elected parties. With a popularly elected President, potential would exist for the representative and democratically elected parliamentary chambers, the repositories of the diffuse power of Australian democracy, to be gradually diminished, while the embodiment of the nation and great powers were vested in one person. That would constitute a very dramatic&mdash;and undesirable&mdash;change to a system which all of us agree has served us well. </PARA>
<PARA>Whatever differences of opinion may presently exist about the most desirable mode of his or her election, I think there is a consensus that the Head of State should be, in some sense, "above politics". </PARA>
<PARA>With this the Government agrees. The Head of State should be an eminent Australian, a widely respected figure who can represent the nation as a whole. This in fact has been the character of the role of the Governor-General and it should be protected and retained in the role of a Head of State. </PARA>
<PARA>Popular election guarantees that the Head of State will not be above politics&mdash;indeed it guarantees that the Head of State will be a politician. As Sir Zelman Cowen pointed out in his speech last week, a "direct election of a President would ensure political outcomes"; and he went on to say that people like himself and another former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, "would not have the resources or inclination to contest such an election". We cannot have a Head of State who is "above politics" if we subject candidates to popular elections&mdash;we will get instead politicians, political parties and political campaigns. And we will get a Head of State with an authority unheard of in our political system and discordant with some of the basic principles on which that system rests. </PARA>
<PARA>We therefore propose, as the Republic Advisory Committee suggested, that the Head of State be elected by a two-thirds majority vote in a joint sitting of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament on the nomination of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Such a joint sitting would be a unique occasion, bringing together all the political parties, and both Houses of the Parliament, in a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation. Obviously, before the vote was taken the non-government parties would have to be consulted to ensure that the candidate had their support. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be impossible for any government to dictate the outcome of this process. A two-thirds majority vote of both Houses would require bipartisan support and ensure that the Head of State had the blessing of all the major parties. The RAC report makes the point that a two-thirds majority in the present parliament would require the votes of 40 more members than the Government presently has. In fact, no government since World War II has enjoyed a two-thirds majority. </PARA>
<PARA>A Head of State appointed by both Houses would be subject to removal by both Houses if it was the opinion of a two-thirds majority that his or her conduct was inappropriate. This is why, given the difficulties of codification I have described and given that we believe the conventions governing the reserve powers will in large measure need to remain with the Head of State, it is imperative that his or her mandate does not flow from popular election but from the representative power of the House of Representatives and the proportional power of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>The other brake on any wilful or misguided behaviour by a Head of State is that the process of removal should not be contingent on a specified set of facts or circumstances or conditions. The joint sitting would be unconstrained in its actions or in its decision by being able to consider squarely the behaviour of any incumbent. </PARA>
<PARA>A further inhibition to misguided or inappropriate behaviour is the proposal that either house may, by simple majority, initiate a joint sitting to remove or censure a Head of State. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that, taken together&mdash;the authority and source of the Head of State's powers coming from the Parliament, removal by the same means as appointment, and the capacity to censure&mdash;these elements provide effective counter-weights to the substantial authority vested in the Head of State through the reserve powers. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, in the light of the events of 1975, any Head of State determined upon a controversial course of action would do so in the knowledge that he or she would be confronted with the weight of public opprobrium, and will be at pains to ensure that every course of action is both warranted and capable of being defended. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposes that, consistent with the convention for Governors-General, the term of office for the Head of State be five years, and that Heads of State be permitted to serve one term only. </PARA>
<PARA>To prevent any attempt to influence Heads of State by offers of subsequent employment, we propose that outgoing Heads of State not be permitted to accept remuneration from the Commonwealth in addition to their pension until five years have passed since their departure from the office. </PARA>
<PARA>As an additional step to ensure that the office of Head of State is not politicised, the Government proposes that serving and former parliamentarians&mdash;Commonwealth, State and Territory&mdash;be excluded from candidature until five years have passed since their departure from parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other detailed issues that will also need to be addressed. For example, arrangements for unexpected vacancies would broadly mirror those currently in place. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not our intention that the Government's proposals should affect the Constitutions of the Australian States. It would be up to each State to decide how in future they would appoint their respective Heads of State. It is reasonable to expect that if the Australian people opt for an Australian Head of State, the States would follow suit. But the question would be for each State to decide. </PARA>
<PARA>In this regard, we were interested that a committee commissioned to examine the issue by the West Australian government concluded that, if the minimalist approach proposed by the Republic Advisory Committee were to be adopted, the position of the States within the federation would not be substantially affected. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is ready to have senior Commonwealth Ministers brief State governments on the proposals and we sincerely hope that all State Premiers will make constructive contributions to the public debate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government puts forward these proposals to provide a basis for considered public discussion. The Australian Constitution cannot be changed in any way without a referendum, and to succeed at a referendum a proposed change must win the agreement of a majority of voters in a majority of States and a majority of voters overall. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government proposes to put the question of a republic to the Australian people some time in 1998 or 1999. Acceptance at the referendum will mean that Australia can be a republic by the year of the centenary of Federation, 2001. </PARA>
<PARA>Before the referendum, there will be extensive consultation with the people of Australia. But it should be clearly understood that nothing we can devise in addition to the due democratic processes will match those processes in the information they provide, the debate they stimulate or the power they give the people. The passage of the Referendum Bill through both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament will be followed by an extensive campaign in which arguments for and against a republic will be put. And the people's vote&mdash;and the people's vote alone&mdash;will decide the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>In short, the Constitution requires that the Parliament, the nation's representative and deliberative body, alone can formally determine the proposals to be put to the people in a referendum. I stress this point. The Parliament alone can formally decide what is put in a referendum. At most, any suggested convention can only be a consultative device and, in obvious ways, an elitist one. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been calls for a constitutional convention, but the limitations of that procedure should be understood. </PARA>
<PARA>There were six Constitutional Conventions between 1973 and 1985 followed by a Constitutional Commission. It is not unfair to say that they were unproductive. And any future convention not limited to the issue of the republic and the Head of State would be a convention going over the same old ground as all the others before it. </PARA>
<PARA>Some people have drawn comparisons with the constitutional conventions of the 1890s, but there is an essential difference between those and any current proposals. Here, we are attempting a modest change to the Constitution&mdash;in the 1890s they were attempting to write it. And among the things they wrote was the requirement that any change to the Constitution must be submitted to a referendum. That is the democratic obligation we are under today. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1890s conventions were proponents of change. They were concerned with one question&mdash;how to create from the separate Australian colonies one indissoluble Commonwealth of Australia. So would any convention on the republic need to be a proponent of the republic, and concerned only with one issue&mdash;the best means by which the people of the Commonwealth of Australia can have an Australian as their Head of State. </PARA>
<PARA>The detail of the changes we propose may at first glance obscure the meaning of them. </PARA>
<PARA>The meaning is simple and, we believe, irresistible&mdash;as simple and irresistible as the idea of a Commonwealth of Australia was to the Australians of a century ago. </PARA>
<PARA>The meaning then was a nation united in common cause for the common good. A nation which gave expression to the lives we lead together on this continent, the experience and hopes we share as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>The meaning now is still a product of that founding sentiment&mdash;it is that we are all Australians. We share a continent. We share a past, a present and a future. And our Head of State should be one of us. </PARA>

I wish to commend to the House an inspiring global event celebrating this anniversary, which arrived in Canberra today. The Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is an Olympic style relay passing a symbolic flaming torch from hand to hand throughout the world; a hopeful and joyful expression for a world of peace and harmony.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First held in 1987, the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run has been run every two years since. The 1995 peace run is the largest and longest yet. Over 50 million strides will carry the peace torch more than 80,000 kilometres, through 83 countries. Here in Australia, a continuous relay is running from Adelaide to Brisbane with satellite events in Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. I was proud to have launched the peace run in Adelaide, and I acknowledge Fiona, whom I passed the torch to as we ran up King William Street, and other runners from Adelaide who are here in the gallery tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The peace run is for all. Every citizen can participate regardless of race, rank, age, gender or faith, in a true spirit of cooperation and harmony. The peace run is non-political and non-denominational and raises no funds for any cause. Its only aim is the promotion of universal harmony, understanding and goodwill. Numerous world leaders in many fields have joined in the spirit of the peace run by holding the peace torch. These have included in recent weeks Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Holiness Pope John Paul II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity also to draw members' attention to another event in honour of the UN's 50th anniversary: an exhibition of Sri Chinmoy peace birds in the theatre foyer of Parliament House, which opened today. The peace birds are a selection from a series of over three million drawings of birds by Sri Chinmoy, representing the spirit of peace and freedom. I urge all members to visit this delightful exhibition before it closes on 29 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives remind us that it is important that peace is promoted internationally, nationally, in our local communities and also in our homes. We must create an atmosphere of seeking to resolve conflict through peace. We have seen the end of the Cold War but the nature of conflict has changed&mdash;there has been an increase in ethnic and religious conflict in some parts of the world. Our distance from these hot spots should not lull us into thinking Australia has nothing to contribute to world peace. </PARA>

In fact, the Prime Minister is the national patron of the peace run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This event, in a sense, has brought all of us together, a timely reminder that the underlying aspirations which unite all of us in this parliament are far deeper and more abiding than the superficial differences that separate us. The peace run was founded by peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who will be visiting Canberra later this month to offer a peace concert here in the Great Hall on the exact 50th anniversary of the signing of the UN charter on 26 June. I hope that many of my colleagues from both sides of the House and from the Senate will take advantage of this rare opportunity to hear one of the world's most remarkable peace lovers and peace servers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most important events that I have been involved in this year is the 50th anniversary celebrations marking the end of the Second World War. Australia Remembers committees around the nation have been organising events to ensure all Australians appreciate the significance of such an important anniversary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two committees in my electorate have been particularly active. Cooktown played a major role in World War II and, fittingly, the Cooktown committee of Australia Remembers has been putting in a considerable amount of effort to make this year special. Indeed, two former Australian Prime Ministers served at Cooktown&mdash;Edward Gough Whitlam and, briefly, John Gorton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had great pleasure in being able to present Don Sinclair a $5,000 cheque for the Cooktown Australia Remembers committee. Don's work at the helm of the committee has been unstinting and committed. Jeff Brearley, with some help from Don Sinclair, has dug away to research and put together some historical notes for community interest and education and for publication in the local paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terry Dukes, the Cooktown airport manager, is on the committee. His assistance has been vital in organising the permanent memorial at the aerodrome. Graham Fookes, a retired commercial artist, has also put in a quite remarkable effort and painted a six-foot logo for the committee. All the committee members have put in a lot of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cooktown will see successful events to mark and remind us of the enormous impact of World War II because of people on the Australia Remembers committee.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cooktown will hold a full week of celebrations to mark the end of World War II, starting on 15 August. The culmination of the events will be the grand dance at the shire hall. People dressed in the clothes of the era and a 40s-style dance band will make sure the dance rekindles a few memories and creates a few new ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also plans to erect a memorial at the Cooktown airport. Cooktown was a major airfield in the Coral Sea campaign. Local war history will be on display during the week at the Cooktown RSL. People might be surprised to learn of the significant role that Cooktown played during World War II. Not surprisingly, the Cooktown Australia Remembers committee received a quarter of all funds of the Leichhardt Australia Remembers budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Port Douglas-Mossman Australia Remembers committee is also very active. Its membership consists of prominent residents who already spend a lot of time working for the community. People like Wally Gray, the president, and Jim Nuttal, the secretary of the committee, have made great contributions to commemorating an important part of Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Rex, awarded the British Empire Medal, has also been contributing enormously to the committee and has managed to convince local organisers that this year's show should carry the Australia Remembers theme. Bert Pollock, a World War II veteran, who has been nominated for Queensland's Premier  Award because of his contribution to that  state and to Australia, will open the show. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person, Jack Fischer, who is not actually a full member of the committee, has still managed to put in a great deal of time for the committee by designing all the displays for the Australia Remembers stall at the show. The committee has received $5,000 to help set up the many events planned. This committee will also ensure that Port Douglas and Mossman do not forget Australia Remembers with its 1940s theme ball and wartime history display. The 1995 Village Carnivale also carried the Australia Remembers banner. All the people involved in Australia Remembers are committed individuals who are already contributing a great deal to their community and have volunteered their precious time to make sure this year's 50th anniversary events stand out in everybody's minds.

<PARA>The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995 amends the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 to reflect amendments made to the Social Security Act 1991 introduced last year or currently before the parliament. On 1 January 1995 the government introduced the youth training initiative as part of Working Nation. Under the youth training initiative, young unemployed people under 18 now have access to case management, labour market programs, and a new income support scheme&mdash;the youth training allowance&mdash;which will, over time, completely replace jobsearch allowance for young unemployed people under 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training allowance aligns benefits for unemployed young people more closely with assistance available under Austudy, particularly in relation to the parental means test and the away from home rate. In other respects, however, the general conditions remain the same as for jobsearch allowance. The policy responsibility for youth training allowance has been allocated to the Department of Employment, Education and Training to reflect the greater emphasis on integrating income support into a process leading to employment or employment-related outcomes. However, the delivery of the youth training allowance is similar to payment of jobsearch allowance with the Department of Social Security being the paying agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the legislation for the youth training allowance and the jobsearch allowance have the same provisions in areas where a common approach is intended. The present bill seeks to amend the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 to incorporate recent and pending amendments to the Social Security Act 1991. These comprise changes made last year to the Social Security Act 1991 and changes proposed by two bills now before the parliament, the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 of this bill relates to the waiting period for clients who have substantial liquid assets. This amendment changes the treatment of liquid assets to allow one-off payments of non-house related debts and proceeds of the sale of the person's home that will be applied to the purchase of another home to be deducted from a person's liquid assets. Disregarding these amounts would make the application of the liquid assets test fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the bill applies to youth training allowance clients, or their partners, who receive periodic compensation payments. The amendments modify the compensation provisions in line with the new income test introduced in the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994. Schedule 3 of the bill ensures that two or more lump sum compensation payments made in respect of one disease, injury or condition sustained in one compensable event are treated as one lump sum compensation payment for the purposes of the compensation recovery provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 of the bill will make sure that the often time-consuming process of assessing qualification can be bypassed if the person's prospective payment would have been precluded in any event by the application of the compensation recovery provisions. I propose to introduce government amendments to make further amendments to the compensation recovery provisions of the act which are similar in nature to those already made by schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current legislation, there is a clear distinction between qualification for and payability of youth training allowance. In general, youth training allowance is no longer payable after a person loses qualification for it. However, the existing debt recovery provisions do not make this clear. Schedule 5 of the bill makes changes to section 261 of the act, one of the main debt creation provisions in the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Parts of a similar provision in the Social Security Act 1991, section 1223, have, in its current form, proved difficult to administer. Reliance on the concept of payability in the creation of debts has been replaced by reference to receipt of payments. Section 261 has been recast in order to make it more readily understood and easier to apply. There are related amendments in schedule 6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments made by schedule 6 will firstly simplify the cancellation and debt creation provisions of the act by providing that, once a client loses his or her qualification for youth training allowance, any further overpayments are recoverable, except as provided for by the automatic termination provisions where the recipient complies with his or her notification qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6 will also create a period of grace in relation to rate reductions for a person who is receiving youth training allowance. Where a change of circumstances occurs and the Department of Social Security is properly notified, youth training allowance continues to be payable to the person, without reduction, until the end of the notification period and then becomes payable at the reduced rate. This is consistent with an amendment introduced in the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments contained in schedule 6 will also ensure that, where a person with an earnings credit balance fails to notify income from employment that would operate to reduce his or her rate of youth training allowance, the rate is to be reduced from the first day of the period in which the person's income exceeds the free area, after taking into account any earnings balance. It will also ensure consistency with other provisions that provide for rate reduction from the day after the change occurred, rather than from the following payday. This amendment is in line with provisions contained in the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current provisions allow the secretary to disclose client information to the secretary of another department of the Commonwealth or to the head of an authority of the Commonwealth for the purposes of that department or authority. Schedule 7 of the bill removes the provision under the act preventing the secretary from delegating the disclosure power so that staff of the department will be able to perform the disclosure function in place of the secretary and will allow the secretary to disclose information not only to a secretary of a Commonwealth department or head of a Commonwealth authority, but also to an officer of that department or authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been confusion about whether or not a decision made personally by the minister in relation to determining an exemption from the deeming provisions&mdash;that is, that loans or classes of low interest loans are not subject to an assumed loan rate&mdash;is a reviewable decision. Schedule 8 of the bill clarifies that such a decision is not subject to review, either internally or by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 9 of the bill clarifies that the secretary may waive a part, not merely the whole, of the waiting or deferment period that occurs after a client starts a vocational training course. In addition, the bill provides that a client undertaking post-secondary courses will not need to serve an education leavers waiting period to the extent that they have already served it in a 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current rules allow payment of youth training allowance to continue for up to 3 weeks after a person commences an Austudy or Abstudy approved course of longer than six months duration pending determination of the person's claim for a student assistance payment. Schedule 10 of the bill allows for the payment to continue for the full three weeks and for the provision to apply regardless of the duration of the course. It also provides for relief from the activity test in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the factors taken into account in working out the effect of the parental means test on the rate of youth training allowance is the valuation of fringe benefits. One of the five types of fringe benefits valued under the act is the loan benefit. If an employer makes a loan to an employee it may be regarded as a loan fringe benefit. Schedule 11 of the bill introduces a mechanism for setting interest rates based on current market rates in order to assess the value of a loan fringe benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act enables the secretary to require a person to provide a statement to the department about a matter that might affect payment of youth training allowance to the person. Where a person complies and, as a result, payment is affected, the general rate increase, reduction or cancellation provisions may apply. Schedule 12 of the bill provides that, in these circumstances, the date of effect of the determination to vary, cancel or suspend payment is the day of the event or change in circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary is able to decide if a person has failed to enter into an activity agreement where the person has been required to enter into such an agreement. Part 1 of schedule 13 clarifies that a person can be taken to have failed to negotiate an activity agreement if the secretary is satisfied that the person is unreasonably delaying entering into the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of schedule 13 will enable the secretary to require a recipient of youth training allowance to attend a place nominated by the secretary for a particular purpose; for example, to attend a course information session at a place other than a Department of Social Security or Commonwealth Employment Service office. It will also provide that a person will be taken to have been notified of this requirement if the notice is sent, in addition to other existing methods of notification, to the person's last known post office box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of schedule 13 provides that only clients who have been approved to participate in labour market programs approved by the secretary will be entitled to the training supplement. Part 4 of schedule 13 provides that the secretary can send notices to a person's last known postal address. Currently the provision covers sending a notice only to a physical address. </PARA>

This bill, the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995, proposes changes to the youth training allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes are to mirror amendments which have been made to the Social Security Act 1991 by the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Act 1994 and the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994. There are also amendments proposed to the Social Security Act in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, which is currently under consideration in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has seen fit, as we saw last year with its employment services bills and the student and youth assistance bills, to introduce a raft of amendments after the legislation has been introduced into this place. At least on this occasion I have to say that the coalition has been given some warning that the amendments are coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994 provided payment of youth training allowance instead of jobsearch allowance to young unemployed people under the age of 18 years. It is intended that over time the youth training allowance will completely replace the jobsearch allowance for young unemployed people under 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change to the youth training allowance from jobsearch allowance for these young people means that the relevant department is now the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The government has argued that this better reflects the emphasis upon employment, education and training outcomes for the youth training allowance target group. The payment agency for the youth training allowance, however, is still the Department of Social Security and, as the youth training allowance is supposed to be similar to the jobsearch allowance, the proposed amendments in this legislation are intended to reflect changes that have been made and are occurring at the present time in the provision of social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the coalition has expressed concern in the past over the lack of justification for the bringing of another major department into the payments system for young people. It is very hard not to feel that what we are observing here is bureaucratic empire building which is going to increase the complexity of this whole system from the point of view of those young people who are seeking assistance. I do not believe that there is currently on the public record any satisfactory justification for the move by the Department of Employment, Education and Training into this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments covered by this bill relate to a wide range of matters, including the liquid assets waiting period, the receipt of periodic compensation payments, lump sum compensation, compensation recovery and debt recovery. Other matters covered are administrative in nature, such as the continuation, variation and termination of determinations, disclosure of information, reviewability of decisions, deferment and waiting periods, loan fringe benefits, the payment of youth training allowance to those commencing full time study, and a range of miscellaneous amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also, as I have said, introduced amendments dealing with compensation recovery provisions in the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. I have had the opportunity to peruse an outline of the government's proposed additional amendments. One can only wonder why these were not introduced with the body of the bill. It certainly creates the impression, as so much of the legislation associated with Working Nation has done, that the whole scheme has been thought up on the run. It is no wonder at all that it has been so incredibly slow to get under way, and in no area is this more obvious than the area of youth training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament is already aware, from matters exposed by the opposition, that there is no prospect this year that the government will reach the traineeship targets in Working Nation. Working Nation set a target of 26,500 traineeships in 1994-95. At the start of April, three-quarters of the way through the year, the government had achieved just over 8,000 placements, and it is now claiming somewhat over 9,000 placements. It is quite unlikely that it will reach even half the target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may well ask why is it that a program introduced with such fanfare in Working Nation has failed so dramatically to offer to young people the opportunities for training that were promised a year ago. It is no good the government coming into the parliament and saying, `Oh, well, we'll meet our targets next year.' There are thousands and thousands of young people in this country who have been denied assistance: denied the opportunities they were promised in Working Nation to undertake training. People in this country will be astonished to learn that, after all the promises and all the hype of Working Nation, the number of young people moving into traineeships in 1994-95&mdash;the first year of Working Nation&mdash;will be lower than in the year before Working Nation came into existence. The number of training opportunities has, in fact, been reduced for these young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could this be? The explanation for that is that this incredible bureaucratic leviathan that the government has set rolling and labelled `Working Nation' has been unable to gear up its engine and to start moving in any satisfactory or effective way over the first 12 months since it was announced. For a year, we have had millions spent on propaganda, but in this area of youth training there has been a complete collapse. There has been a complete collapse of the operation of the traineeship system. That is because the upheaval in the CES, the Commonwealth Employment Service, has led to the dropping of the ball. The CES has been so busy reorganising the bureaucracy and fighting with the Public Sector Union over whether the resources to manage Working Nation are adequate or not that the Commonwealth Employment Service, which has a key role in the provision of training opportunities, has simply forgotten that role. It has not had time to perform it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people have been left on the scrap heap, without these training opportunities that they were promised. So far, it has just been a propaganda fraud. That has to be said. It is without any credibility that we are constantly being reassured that it is up and running now: that these opportunities are coming through, that the number of people being placed in traineeships is now mounting, and that the process is speeding up. It will have to speed up a great deal if the traineeships promised over the first two years of Working Nation are to come into existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this bureaucratic upheaval, the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;with its 16,000 staff, massive regulations and huge bureaucracy&mdash;is making a grab for the territory of the Department of Social Security by introducing parallel legislation. That introduces a great deal of complexity into the whole process. I will have much more to say about that later. However, the government has assumed that this legislation has been introduced in a non-controversial way and that it is appropriate legislation for the Main Committee to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at the very time when this legislation is in the Main Committee, parallel legislation is in the Senate and the House&mdash;legislation about which the opposition has significant concerns. I have no doubt that that legislation will be debated vigorously and that amendments will be brought forward in the Senate. If that other legislation is successfully amended in the Senate, where will that leave this piece of legislation? It will have to be amended to take into account the views of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has been quite obliging in making sure that we have been properly briefed on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill&mdash;and I thank him for that. However, the minister's second reading speech was drafted by the department and it is all about the administrative arrangements for the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That speech did not address the question of whether or not the training that will be offered under this legislation is going to meet the needs of young people. The speech was about the concerns of the administrative system. However, the minister must have met young unemployed people out in the real world&mdash;as I meet them as I go around the country&mdash;who are desperately demoralised by the system which has ensnared them at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, those young people are grateful for and welcome the monetary benefits that the system provides to them. However, they are deeply resentful of the way in which the system is pumping them through labour market programs which do not meet their needs. Just a few weeks ago I talked to a group of young unemployed people in Caboolture and neighbouring towns. They said, `We've just been through a horticulture course.' Apparently, there had to be a minimum of 20 young people on that course. I said, `How many of you were interested in horticulture?' They replied, `Two of us, perhaps.' I asked, `What did the rest of you think about going through a course like that?' They replied, `Well, it wasn't relevant.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then asked those young people, `What do you think about all this? Did you mind going through it?' They said, `Look, we are absolutely sick and tired of being asked to sit around and do these things just because the people running the system need us to do them so they can meet their targets.' One long-term unemployed person even said to me, `The reason I keep going to these things is because I feel sorry for the person who has been appointed as our case manager. He has to meet his targets. This poor bloke keeps putting me in these programs and I know that if I refuse to go in them he's going to be in trouble with his superiors in the department. So I go along to oblige him.' That is what was said. Honourable members opposite may shake their heads, but if they talked to young people they would find that those young people are absolutely fed up with this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure those young people would like to have heard some assurance from the minister that this youth training allowance is going to improve the situation. What have we heard? We have heard the minister come in and give what one can only describe as a very bureaucratic speech. It may be that he or his department has been misled by the fact that this has come into the Main Committee into thinking that this is somehow or other all non-controversial. It may be thought, `The great bureaucratic machine rolls on and we will go through all the bureaucratic and administrative details but we do not really need to worry about addressing the substance of what all this is about.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never read anything from the department or heard anything from the minister or his senior minister, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), as to how all this is actually going to help young people. What are the selection processes going to be like for putting young people into these training programs? For young people such as the young people that have come to observe this chamber, what future is this legislation offering? There is no assurance whatever that the situation which has been created is going to be in any way improved by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain to be convinced about this. We are very reasonable on this point. We want to cooperate with the government, to be constructive in making sure that there are sensible training schemes in place for young people. Instead, out there the great majority of Australians believe&mdash;I have no hesitation in saying this&mdash;that young people in this country are being asked to go through training scheme after training scheme which does not lead on to real jobs, and that those training schemes have precious little to do with even the very scarce work that is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training schemes are not linked in to the small business opportunities which exist in the area. They are not well linked in at all to any of the skills audits that regional development programs are undertaking. They are there and the training opportunities are offered because the minister's department has got those on the books and are what it is prepared to offer. The bureaucracy says, `A minimum number of people is needed to go through these schemes and so we are going to pump you through these schemes, regardless of whether they are what you need or not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has places where youth unemployment is as high as 70 per cent. That was the most recent figure for inner Melbourne. Right through the areas of Australia's major cities, not just the state capital cities but major provincial cities, where youth unemployment is so high&mdash;many of them areas represented by the Labor Party&mdash;there has been a total abandonment of these young people. The level of youth unemployment we have is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the answer to all of this? Ultimately, we all know, the answer is to provide jobs. In this hobbled economy that we have, small business is shuffling along under the chains that have been welded on by the colleagues of the government in the ACTU just to make sure that they do not lose any of their power. This hobbled small business is unable to move fast enough and look ahead far enough to offer jobs that these young people are looking for. The real solution is to strike off the chains. Then we will get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead we have the bureaucratic machine gearing itself up, putting on more people to deal with the unemployed, and pieces of legislation like this coming through which duplicate pieces of legislation that the Department of Social Security is responsible for, expanding the bureaucracy. The government says, `Look what we are doing. Look at this whole great edifice of assistance and welfare and training that we have put in place to help these young people.' I have got homeless young people in my electorate living in a tree house because there is no adequate assistance for them. Within the last couple of weeks I have had these young people in my office and I can tell the minister that they would not touch his department with a barge pole if they could possible help it. They hate the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is, in many ways, unfair to the very good people who are trying to do a decent job. But, believe me, your people have not convinced these young people that they understand and they care and they are really going to do anything to help. There is a big problem here. These kids are running all the time. They have nowhere to live; they do not have any hope; they are trying to build independent lives for themselves in the gaps that are left by the welfare system. And it is disappointing, Minister, that you have come into this chamber today and made a speech which does not address any of these problems, and which does not even tell us that this system that is now being set up is going to help these young people to get adequate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do we in the coalition think about this particular piece of legislation? It is legislation which is unnecessary, because of its duplication; it is legislation which ought not to be in this chamber, because it is not non-controversial; and it is legislation which is going to have to be addressed by us through amendments in the Senate. As I said, it is legislation which mirrors social security legislation. There are two bills currently going through this parliament which will amend social security legislation. I refer, specifically, to the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6, 7 and 8 of this bill, which, respectively, make amendments relating to continuation, variation and termination of decisions, disclosure of information, and the review of some ministerial decisions, mirror changes which the government is proposing in the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has been notified of the coalition's intention to oppose or amend the relevant sections of that bill in the Senate. It would appear that the Department of Employment, Education and Training is unaware of this. Accordingly, I notify this chamber that schedule 6, items 1 to 6, and schedule 8 will be opposed in the Senate, and amendments to schedule 7 will be moved in the Senate to mirror the amendments which the coalition seeks to make in the Senate to the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. The provisions of schedule 3 of this bill will be debated further when the parallel provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 are debated in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's last-minute amendments to this bill deal with compensation recovery. The provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, which these provisions are supposed to mirror, have been criticised on the basis that, if the compensation recovery provisions are incorrectly applied, there will be a delay in payment which may be lengthy during appeals as qualification for the allowance has not been established. The coalition will not oppose these amendments, but we will carefully scrutinise the operation of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the contentious nature of the social security bills, I have to say that it is quite surprising that this bill has been introduced with such haste, and even more surprising that it was relegated to this chamber as a non-contentious bill. I take this opportunity to protest about the relegation of the bill to this chamber. I can only wonder why this bill is being pushed through so rapidly when the parallel pieces of legislation that the government is introducing in relation to social security have still not been properly and fully considered by this parliament. And, of course, when they are fully considered&mdash;and if the Senate, as it may well do, amends them&mdash;then further amendments will be required to this piece of legislation. And if the government's whole approach to the problem of youth assistance and youth training is going to be such a bureaucratic one, one would at least hope that the bureaucratic aspects of it would be treated with a great deal more efficiency than they have been up to this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to speak on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995 because I have a particular interest in young people. I have worked in the youth policy area through my party and was involved for some time with a program for homeless youth. I am very well aware of the needs of young people. I am also keenly interested in the activities and the needs of young people in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has painted a very gloomy picture. While I agree with him to the extent that there are young people who are in need of assistance and who are feeling desperate at times, that is precisely why the legislation has been introduced. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) said, the youth training initiative was part of the Working Nation program. That program was instigated to activate programs to get unemployed people back into work, whether they are the long-term unemployed or young people. The minister also said this initiative provides access to case management, labour market programs and income support, all of which are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the community there are still hard-hearted and ignorant people who have an unfortunate tendency to pick on young people who spend a period of time receiving government assistance, but, in my experience, a vast majority of young people are keen to make a contribution to society through training, education and work. There is no need to draw artificial distinctions between different forms of assistance provided by the government to young people. Whether they access formal training options, new work opportunities, post-secondary education or community activities, young people have the right to be given a chance in life and a duty to make the most of it. For many young people this is not easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having just completed an inquiry into youth homelessness with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I am well aware that accessing any form of training or education is an uphill battle for some young people who do not always have the advantage of family support. The government has supported a number of programs where disadvantaged young people can receive the youth training allowance and be treated with the special care they need to gain the confidence and self-esteem to realise their full potential as members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member opposite has poured cold water on labour market programs. In my experience, in my electorate these labour market programs have worked extremely well. The LEAP program is one that I particularly draw attention to. The member also said that these programs are not relevant to work opportunities. My electorate must be unique. It is an environmentally sensitive and high tourism area and most of the training programs that young people are sent to in my electorate involve the environment and hospitality. Our local TAFE and CES are geared to the programs that are going to help young people get employment in those areas which are relevant to the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When somebody goes into a training program there is not a guarantee at the end that they are going to get a job, but at least it gives them some qualifications when opportunities arise. As far as my electorate is concerned, those programs are certainly very well targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One program in my electorate that I would like to draw attention is called Intelife, under the auspices of Mission Employment which is part of the Sydney City Mission. It targets young people at risk who have not been successful at negotiating the mainstream education system. It provides a comprehensive scheme of training, practical experience and personal development. Part of that program involves building their own accommodation. They have a wonderful bushland site and are putting their own efforts into their future. It is also aimed at developing models of ecologically sustainable and socially responsible lifestyles. This strategy for young people taps into the resources of the local community, which is very much involved. It is as much about gathering together the resources available locally as it is about offering government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other examples of this facilitating approach are the homeless youth pilot projects which are under way at eight locations around Australia. These were initiated through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Each individual project has been designed by local stakeholders. For young people who do not live near a major metropolitan centre getting access to training and job opportunities can be difficult. With the youth training allowance, an away from home rate can be paid to assist unemployed young people who need to live away from home while they look for work or train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training initiative is more than a payment; it is a strategy. It is an active strategy which provides young people with an individual case manager, and, through regular meetings, barriers to the employment of that person are identified and a plan is developed to deal with the issues involved. This system of case management is supported by an extensive range of labour market programs which provide effective resources to overcome barriers. The resources may range from initiatives as simple as providing bus tickets to attend job interviews to six-month training placements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management is an important initiative and it is putting a human face on the Commonwealth Employment Service. We have heard a lot of criticism of the service today, but, as far my electorate is concerned, it does a fantastic job. The Commonwealth Employment Service is providing young people with a go-between who will help to negotiate large and sometimes impersonal systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Homeless youth pilot programs have brought together the resources of local community agencies, local employers and businesses, local government and Commonwealth departments. Each resource is different. At Port Hedland, the resource focuses on homeless Aboriginal school students. At Surry Hills in Sydney, the resource is used to employ a liaison officer to coordinate services for homeless youth. At Launceston, the focus is on the transition from school to work. With the assistance of the Commonwealth government, each project offers local solutions to local problems. The shadow minister for employment, training and family services, the honourable member for Goldstein, constantly criticises bureaucracies which shove people through a sausage machine. These examples of programs&mdash;I have a lot more examples&mdash;counter the criticisms of the honourable member and they show that the programs are individually targeted to the needs of young people and to the needs of the local area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the youth training initiative, income support is but one strand in a comprehensive safety net.

There is a question to be asked about duplication in a lot of these amendments, but I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will agree, as those opposite will agree, that the youth of Australia is the most important asset our country has. Our young people live in possibly the best country in the world. Our country is wealthy in resources and in environment, and, both naturally and socially, we are world leaders. In infrastructure, Australia offers great support. Australia has a system of government which is envied by many countries and it has institutions which provide security and peace within our land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our young people have, therefore, an opportunity to progress with hope for a great future. Young people are our greatest asset and they should be nurtured and developed to ensure continuity of our system of private and public institutions. Young people should be encouraged, and yet the facts outweigh the high principles that we should have. Today, Australia's youth is under great threat, and they are under threat by the very institutions and systems which should be encouraging and nurturing them. Our young people are beginning to realise that many of their number have no hope whilst the Labor government remains in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment rate within the youth area is generally approximately 30 per cent, and the member for Goldstein said that, in some parts of Melbourne, there is a 70 per cent unemployment rate within the youth area. Australia has one of the highest rates of suicide in the Western world amongst the young, and specifically amongst under-25-year-old males. It is estimated that over 21,000 young people are homeless. That is an amazingly high number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system of training for our young people ignores the need for skilled training through apprenticeship schemes, and our apprenticeships are at the lowest number that they have ever been. Honourable members will recall the recent national debate about bringing trained labour migrants into Australia. Union argument at the time was based on the question as to why we do not train our own workers and why we are bringing in people from overseas. The union argument is quite difficult to understand when our policies under the particular political arm of unions&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;is overseeing the downturn in engaging apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that apprenticeships are being priced out of the market. When I commenced my apprenticeship some 25 years ago, my first salary was about 20 per cent of the then adult wage. And so it should have been: a 16-year-old entering the work force is not going to be very productive. In my first year, I swept the floor about three times a day and went and got the lunches and did that sort of thing, and I was not very productive at all. Some would say that I am not very productive now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Moreton, but that is not the case. The benefits come to the employer from an apprenticeship in the second half of the indentured period, not in the first half. In fact, I can say from personal experience that the second half of an apprenticeship period for an employee is very productive. The salary levels, when I started, were reflected in that pay scale. However, it did change rapidly, once that initial, non-productive period was over. So 20 per cent of the adult journeyman wage was what I was receiving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most cases, it seems that the first-year apprentice salary now is more like 40 per cent of the adult wage. I am not advocating any change of policy on wages for apprentices, other than to point out that, since apprenticeship salaries have been brought into line with adult salaries, the number of apprenticeships has fallen. One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to realise the relationship between salary and opportunity. If an employer wanted to employ someone, who would he employ? Would he employ, for instance, a skilled worker on an adult wage, or would he employ an apprentice, who is unproductive for many years, on 40 per cent of the adult wage? Speaking from personal experience, I do not blame small businesses for employing a skilled worker. In today's environment, employers need to be more attuned to the operational costs of the enterprise rather than being philanthropic with the training up of young people. Therefore, they are seeking the best value for their enterprise dollar, and are making it a well-spent dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where today is the incentive for employers to provide a future for our country by providing opportunities and training for our youth? We hear a lot about wage incentives and all sorts of programs, but the fact is that there is not a lot of opportunity for young people these days in training programs of any significance. That is why, I guess, the unions are lamenting the fact that we are importing skilled labour. If they are lamenting this, they should in fact look to their own policies and allow incentives which encourage employers to encourage and employ our young. This notion is often pooh-poohed by those in the so-called know of policy development and that sort of thing but, in the real world, employers do need incentives to employ our young people. Currently, when we have an unemployment figure of greater than 30 per cent, it is a serious issue: we should never accept those sorts of figures, but we are doing so at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995 cover some administration requirements to operate the act, yet they are beginning to be even more bureaucratic and regressive. Frankly, the act is a bit cumbersome. Amendments which make it harder for young people who need encouragement and hope are not the activities of a government which cares about our youth. The government brags about keeping kids at school until year 12, saying that it is a step closer to making us the clever country. But is it really clever to keep at school until year 12 those children who do not want to be there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keeping a youth at school when there is no hope of moving on to university certainly should be questioned. What are the benefits for that particular youth, now and in the future, and what are the benefits for the community? When one observes the curriculum that a lot of these year 12 students are studying at the moment, one has to question the significance of staying on. Are we, in fact, making these youths job ready whilst they are at school? The answer to that question is a definite no. This is not the fault of the students, nor of the schools, nor of the curriculum. It is my view that it is the fault of the economy, which does not allow young people to enter the work force at a young age into a career that can help them develop work skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the Labor government is to blame for this sorry situation. Without moving into an economic debate concerning these amendments, I would just like to say that the prolonged poor industrial policy, which has seen an increase in the numbers of long-term unemployed, a drop in the availability of apprenticeships and a huge youth unemployment factor, has been detrimental to the development of our young people in Australia. As I said before, young people are our greatest asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example of how the government has changed the thinking and market for youth employment, I would like to relate an experience I had with a human resource manager from a leading Australian company in Perth. This HR manager said that he employed only year 12 students. I asked him why he did not employ 16-year-olds that leave school at year 10. He said that year 12 students are more intelligent. I thought about that for a while. How can year 12 students be more intelligent? It is only a difference of two years. He said that because they stay on at school they are more intelligent. I said that that would put out the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who left school at 15. He said, `Well, we believe that year 12 students are more intelligent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked him what the turnover rate was among people who came to work for him. He said, `It is huge; 18- to 20-year-olds don't stick around.' I asked him what he had them doing, and he answered that they were doing filing and basic things in training. I said, `Would it not be a better investment for you to have a four-year training program for 16- to 20-year-olds so that you can train them up? They might not be productive in the first couple of years but you would have a good asset in an employee later on who has been four-year trained and loyal.' He did not quite see the point in doing that. He would rather have year 12 students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement to have year 12 is creating greater demand within our employment sector. Young people who probably cannot cope with the school system&mdash;like, for instance, our Prime Minister&mdash;have not got an opportunity of moving into the employment market these days. The great concern I have is that we are not providing opportunities for those who do not meet the required qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also highlight my concerns about the future for our country, which according to current figures will have a shortage of skilled labour moving into the 21st century. We are creating a group of people who will not be allowed to enter the workplace in the future because we are not providing the opportunities for them now. Yes, we are providing welfare and training allowances and all that, but it does not seem to be working&mdash;there is a 30 per cent unemployment rate at the moment. What we really need in Australia is skilled workers, and we are not providing the training to develop those skilled workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look, for example, at the current rate of student enrolment at our universities. The government quite rightly says that there are more people at university now than there ever have been before. That is a fact.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. But the fact of the matter is that there are actually fewer new students entering university right now. How can that be? We have got more students at university but there are actually fewer getting the opportunity to move into university. There are more people staying on at university now, however, doing double degrees. Why they are staying on is that jobs just are not available. I heard recently the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU saying that, because there are so many people studying law now in Australia that there are more people studying law than are actually practising, a law degree is virtually an arts degree now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are facing a real challenge in Australia at the moment regarding training our young people. We have to question whether we should be just keeping them as academics&mdash;keeping them at school longer and even at university. We have got to get them into the work force and skill up our work force, or in the future when our population drifts off we will not have that skilled labour available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we need these amendments? It seems that most of them are uncontroversial, although the shadow minister did signal that some challenges to them will take place in the Senate. However, there are a few points I would like to make under schedule 13. Paraphrased, it says basically that the secretary can determine whether a young person has failed to enter into a youth training agreement if the person fails to attend the negotiation of the agreement, fails to respond to correspondence about the agreement or fails to agree to terms of the agreement proposed by the CES, or otherwise it is considered that the person is unreasonably delaying entering into the agreement. If the terms are not met, then the youth will have the entitlement revoked. In other words, people who do not meet the terms agreed by the CES will lose their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an example which came to me recently.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A young man who I think is about 17 has been out of school and unemployed for two years. He suffers with a bit of dyslexia; that is probably the reason why he left school. He was told by the people running a training program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are no doubt aware, failure to attend the start of a program will result in your benefits being withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear case of `Either you do this or your benefits are going to go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the program that he was asked to do? I will read this out. The Royal Life Saving Society was running an aquatic care program, and advertising it as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Lifesaving Society is desperate to find young people to spend six months of fun in the sun. If you enjoy swimming, surfing, abseiling and the great outdoors, we are the people to see. Come and join our aquatic care program.</PARA>
<PARA>What does the aquatic care program actually involve, other than the basic Royal Life Saving Society's certificates? It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experiences and the training that you will receive during this particular program include: surfing, windsurfing, bodyboarding, canoeing, abseiling and a variety of other cultural experiences.</PARA>
<PARA>Cultural experiences? Let us see what the other cultural experiences are. They include: fishing, sailing, surfing, snorkelling and powerboat driving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This course may be a very good course to build self-esteem. But the problem with that building of self-esteem is what happens at the end of the particular course, after people have had their self-esteem built up. According to the person from the department whom I spoke to recently, they lose all their long-term unemployment status and they go back to the start of the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to question that fact about these courses. People build up their self-esteem and then, if they do not get a job in abseiling&mdash;I do not know of many jobs in abseiling or powerboat driving being advertised&mdash;they go back to the start of the queue and start the regressive demands upon their self-esteem again. Here we are, building up self-esteem, then dropping them off and starting it all over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we doing that to our young people, who are the future of our country? It is probably not meant to be the case, but I think what is happening is that those smart politicians in the department and those smart politicians in the government are seeing this as a way of fudging the figures in relation to a true reflection of the unemployment situation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments add to the cumbersome nature of the original act. The original act does not provide jobs; it only provides a form of training allowance. The original act is difficult to administer, as the shadow minister pointed out. The original act adds to the fraud the government tries to place upon the Australian people by trying to hide the true unemployment position of the country. As I just explained, if you lose your long-term status you go back to the start again. When the government says that numbers of long-term unemployed are being reduced, are they being reduced by the training programs, or are they, in fact, being hidden in some way? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, these amendments add to the cumbersome nature of the original act. They take away an appeal process for aggrieved young people and place the appeal process&mdash;creating an inordinate power base&mdash;with the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue is the way we provide for our young. Are we to accept that government should be providing for our young, or are we to accept the fact that our community has a responsibility to look after our young people? We, as a community, should be responsible for our young people. We should be encouraging and empowering those who have the power to employ and train young people to employ young people. Yet we are bogging them down with bureaucratic amendments and acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we afford to not be concerned about our most precious asset&mdash;our young people&mdash;when so many of them are looking for some direction from the leaders of the country?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assets of this country are its people. Our young people play an important role in the future of our country, and we should never ignore them.

I hope that the government takes on board the real concerns of the community. I am sure that, together, we can find some solutions. But, until we start working together as a community&mdash;certainly within the employment sector&mdash;our young people will not have the direction and hope that they long for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to participate in this debate on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995. I want, in the opening of my remarks on this very important legislation for young, unemployed people in our country, to make reference to the shadow minister who spoke earlier on this matter, and to express my concern about his various pronouncements and attacks&mdash;made not only in the debate, but also in his press releases&mdash;on our government's apparent fudging of our long-term and other employment statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, he is quoted in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 2 June entitled `Drop in jobless numbers found to be misleading'. I quote the journalist Mark Riley who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures obtained by opposition spokesperson Dr David Kemp show that more than 150,000 long-term unemployed people have been placed in work programs of 13 weeks or longer.</PARA>
<PARA>He suggests that what we have then done is to reclassify all these people. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 70,000 long-term unemployed people have lost their long-term status after participating in short-term government job training schemes and returning to the dole queues.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of thing that the shadow minister gets into time and time again, instead of getting on with some constructive policy. We never hear about policy on these matters. What we get is a continual attempt to cut and paste the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has commented in two press releases on this matter in an attempt to get the facts through. He is very kind to the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). He says, in his press release of 2 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Kemp is clearly unable to understand simply facts.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the minister was being very altruistic. I would instead suggest that the shadow spokesperson actively and consistently misconstrues the facts to put a very wrong interpretation on these figures. As the minister says, referring to the Bureau of Statistics:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABS definition has not changed in any substantive way in at least nine years. Its definition of long-term unemployment is an internationally accepted definition. Is Dr Kemp really proposing that Australia move away from this?</PARA>
<PARA>It has nothing to do with CES classifications. The important issue is that long-term unemployed people who are on training programs are in no way reclassified. Those long-term unemployed people who get a guaranteed job offer&mdash;which was part of our job compact and part of Working Nation and has been most successful&mdash;may, in fact, be in employment from six to 12 months, not 13 weeks. Having had that effective work experience, they then obviously lose their long-term unemployment status. The figure that Dr Kemp has suggested in his press release is 70,000 people, but in the minister's press release of 5 June, in which he quotes Dr Kemp's release, he asks the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are there 70,000 people who start their employment or training programs as long-term unemployed and are still unemployed but now classified as short-term unemployed?</PARA>
<PARA>And the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not correct. In fact, in 1994/95, less than 10,000 have been classified as short-term unemployed after they have completed or left their employment program. Many more of those people go on to full-time unsubsidised jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>The job compact, with case management of long-term unemployed, has been one of the real success stories of Working Nation. Why was this so? Because the government went out and engaged in a very long consultative process with community groups, with people from all sectors of business, government and service sectors in this area, listened to what the community said and then brought together in Working Nation a truly historic group of initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these, of course, is the youth training initiative which we are defending. I anticipate and I hope that in question time today the minister will once again nail this sort of nonsense from the shadow spokesperson who is adept at this, but I do not see that he is very adept at getting a policy position together on this or any other matter. I want to also make the point that the OECD economic survey of Australia for 1995 has praised our Working Nation initiatives, particularly the job compact. That survey says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Nation package will, in a relatively efficient way, help ease the difficulties the long-term unemployed have experienced in obtaining a job. These initiatives are an important element of the government's strategy to bring the unemployment rate down to five per cent over the next five years. The overall impact of the Working Nation employment package on the labour market will depend importantly on the quality of its design and implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>We have effectively achieved a great deal in this matter in a very short time. Not only have we delivered a huge number of jobs back into the economy; in comparison to the 1980s recovery, in particular, the long-term unemployed group in our unemployment statistics have been picked up precisely because we have put effective management of this group into the system. That is also true of our youth training initiative, which the amendments to this bill are designed to make even more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Main Committee that the youth training initiative commenced in January of this year&mdash;only this year&mdash;and it aims to assist young unemployed people between 15 and 17. It may have escaped the notice of the opposition, Mr Deputy Speaker, but let me remind you that this issue of long-term unemployed youth is not new. If we care to look back at the statistics&mdash;and I certainly hope opposition members will do so&mdash;we see that young people who leave school early are very likely to be in the long-term unemployed category, because the world has moved on. Technology changes in workplaces have meant that while 10, 15 or 20 years ago kids used to leave school at 15 and get a job in a bank or a factory and work their way up, those jobs are no longer available for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government realised this fact, and over the lifetime of this government we have moved to increase education for young people. During his last visit to Rockhampton, when he opened an information technology building at the Central Queensland University, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) reminded the audience that, when we came into government in 1983, three out of 10 young people completed high school. The figure now is closer to nine out of 10, in the space of 12 years. As the Prime Minister said on that occasion, we cannot make a clever country if only three out of 10 of our children finish basic high school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, we would be appalled to think that would be an acceptable figure. I am sure nobody in the opposition or anywhere else in the community would consider that to be an effective number; and yet under the last government that was fine. That was okay. Then, we had people who needed to move to the top to get the university places, overwhelmingly from the middle class and the professional class. They were the people going to university. As the Prime Minister said during his Rockhampton visit, the reasons we moved to introduce HECS and a system of university students contributing to their own education was that, in spite of the groundbreaking innovation of the Whitlam government to make university studies free, nothing had in fact changed in terms of the demographics of young people going to university. Effectively, the working taxpayers&mdash;those people defined on the other side as the battlers&mdash;were still paying for the free university education of the middle classes and the professional classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no equity or justice or access in that, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is why we brought in a contribution by all university students when they were able to afford to pay it&mdash;effectively, when they were earning average weekly earnings. Because they were most likely to be in the upper percentages of income earners after they had completed their university studies, that enabled this government to put another 30 per cent of university places in the system. That effectively benefited the battlers, the women, the people from non-English speaking backgrounds, and the sons and daughters of what we would call the ordinary salary and wage earners; so this government's record is a very proud one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is certainly true, given that we had a huge intake and a continuation of young people through high school, that we were not catering effectively for their needs. We saw that, when young people did drop out, they were very likely to be in the dole queues; not even learning to develop those job skills that would make them job-ready. A lot of concern was expressed by communities during those consultations that, when young people were able just to go and get the dole, that was a disincentive for them to get education or to participate in work and training opportunities. But if young people leave school early, they are 2 1/2 times more likely to become long-term unemployed than those who do not complete secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) said that the human resources people are wrong and that there is a difference in intelligence. That is not the issue. The issue is that there are basic skills and competencies that are required across all work situations. Flexible training of young people will enable them to pick up and use that skill base in a variety of work opportunities. There are very few jobs for people without skills these days. Those days have gone. While the members of the opposition seem to think that the world has not moved on since the 1950s, we know that it has. </PARA>

The youth training allowance will eventually totally replace the jobsearch allowance for Australians under the age of 18. It will mean that people in this category concentrate on the only possible recipe for future success&mdash;that is, training for the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that case management is the single most effective aspect of this package of measures. Young people not only respond well to, but need, one-on-one contact. Just as the best training is given on a one-to-one basis, the best help is given on a one-to-one basis. Assistance in this area is something I feel particularly close to and feel very strongly about. As some people in this place know, my background lies in training. Immediately prior to entering the parliament, I ran a job club in Launceston training the unemployed under my business, Multiskill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that many people on the other side of the Committee are going to run the argument, when they speak on this bill, that there is no use in training people for jobs that do not exist and that the only reason the government is interested in training is that it hides the true levels of the unemployed. Let me inform the Committee that these arguments do not have any validity at all, especially for anyone who has worked in that kind of environment. The job club that I ran in Launceston had an 80 per cent success rate in assisting our students to gain work. Organisations in my electorate, such as Northern Joblink, Launceston Skillshare, Glenara Skillshare and others, are still being very successful. I commend them and the work that they do for the young people and the people who are seeking employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role that training plays in achieving employment outcomes cannot be devalued. It is absolutely critical. I would like to take a moment here to mention a couple of cases that have come to mind as being quite outstanding. For example, I can remember a young man coming to me who was, I imagine, about 17 1/2 at that stage. His name was Gareth and he had absolutely no direction in his life at 17 1/2. He had done a little bit of hospitality training but it really was not him. So he came along to the job club, firstly, to be with other people who were seeking employment and, secondly, to see if he could find some direction in his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We opened up all sorts of possibilities. At school he had done some computer training and he had rather enjoyed that. Part of my company was a bank of computers, 12 computers, and we ran computer training programs, so we sent him on to computer training. He became so good at it that he landed a part-time job with Nestle. He has continued on that part-time job. He sometimes has 20 hours a week&mdash;his minimum is 20&mdash;and sometimes he has 35 hours a week. But he is extremely happy with what he has been able to achieve. He has a goal, he has a direction, he knows where he is going in life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After he left me at the job club, before his job eventuated, he continued that contact back to the job club, because I gave every student that came to me that one-on-one training contact and assurance that I would never let them down. I do not know sometimes whether it works to be beneficial, to give that one-on-one, because Gareth has now ended up being my youngest daughter's boyfriend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had many young people that came into other programs that I ran through Multiskill. I can remember a group of young students that had been selected by the police and corrective services for this particular program. We thought, `Golly, what are we going to do with these young people?' So it was a motivational program. But many of those young people then went on to other training. Some went into hospitality, some went to TAFE. A couple actually went back and matriculated, and one also went on to computer studies. They made some decisions because people cared, because government put things into place for them to access programs far more easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training allowance is going to move the benefits for the young unemployed into a tighter and closer relationship with the assistance which is available under Austudy. All those sorts of things come into place to assist our young people and we must never, ever let those programs disintegrate. This relationship is closest with regard to the parental means test and the away from home rate of benefit. The youth training allowance does, however, still retain the same general conditions as for jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training will have the policy responsibility for the youth training allowance. I particularly commend this initiative. It is this department which is best set up and has the best skills to deal with a program which uses a training focus to foster and deliver an employment related outcome. This really is an example of horses for courses, with the Department of Social Security remaining the pay agency for the youth training allowance. The youth training allowance is a hybrid. It has been born because the government has seen and responded to a specific need. It takes the best methods of service, focus and delivery from each of the departments of Social Security and Employment, Education and Training. It is without doubt one of the best examples of this federal government highlighting an area of specific need and responding to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures of this bill are drafted to specifically fit its target group. The liquid assets test will be made fairer. It will allow for the proceeds of the sale of a person's home to be deducted in the liquid assets test if that money is used to buy another home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current provisions allow for the payment of youth training allowance to continue for up to three weeks after the individual commences an Austudy or Abstudy approved course for longer than six months. This is currently dependent on the determination of the person's claim for student assistance payment. This bill allows for that payment to continue for the full three weeks, regardless of course duration. As well as this measure it provides relief from the activity test during these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to give an overview of the central component of the youth training initiative. One of the most important components of the youth training initiative is access&mdash;access to labour market programs. Young people who are assessed as being in this category of high risk of long-term unemployment have instant access to the full spectrum of labour market programs. Those not assessed as being in the high risk category have access to labour market programs after 26 weeks. I commend that initiative. Having been in this area of training, I know that it will make things a lot easier for the young people out there who are desperate to do something with their lives. The most important point to make here is that the government is making every endeavour to make sure that those most at risk are targeted early and helped early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of labour market programs is also very important. The programs are designed to be most relevant to the needs of their target group. They include wage subsidies for jobs under the national wage training award, work experience and training through the land care and environment action program, training through accredited training for youth and something that is reflective of my background&mdash;jobsearch assistance through job clubs and formal training options. That has to be an absolute bonus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New work opportunities will also be available from 1 July this year to clients who have been in receipt of youth training allowances for six months. The youth training initiative will also give early assistance into traineeships and apprenticeships. There will be 60,000 new apprenticeship places in the next financial year, as well as 34,000 new traineeship places, an initiative that needs to be commended. There are many young people out there seeking apprenticeship places and traineeship places, but they have not been available, so this will be a very good option for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another extremely good initiative is the expansion in pre-vocational courses to 15,000 places. Prior to my working with job club, I worked with TAFE and I know how special the pre-vocational courses run at the TAFE colleges are for the young people to go on into the work places. These new places are needed and, better still, they are targeted to those who are in need of the general and vocational skills which are required to gain employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at the end of April this year, over 4,500 young Australians under the youth training initiative had commenced labour market programs. This also included almost 900 traineeships. So the march has begun. I think it should be highlighted that only those who are registered as unemployed are eligible for the youth training allowance. There have been cases of some students applying for the allowance when they enrol in courses after not having been registered with the CES. In these circumstances, such people can be referred by the CES to labour market programs that involve vocational training. If, at the end of the course, they have not found employment, the CES will continue to provide assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of whether someone can continue to receive youth training allowance for longer than six months. In most cases, the youth training allowance will be payable to people who attend courses that are of six months or less and Austudy will be payable for courses that are longer than six months. However, some labour market programs are greater than six months. In these cases, if people have been referred to that program by the CES they will continue to be paid the youth training allowance. The youth training allowance is the basic plank of the youth training initiative because it provides the income support needed to make the program function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be eligible for the youth training allowance there are a number of basic criteria. People must be 16 or 17, they must be registered as unemployed with the CES and they must not be in receipt of jobsearch allowance. Fifteen-year-olds are only eligible if they live away from home, are unsupported and are experienced in the labour force. This essentially means that they must have a work history or 13 weeks registration as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allowance is paid in three rates. There is an at-home rate which is paid up to a maximum of $134.60 per fortnight and a minimum rate of $62.90. The away from home rate is for those who need to live away from home in order to undertake jobsearch activities or approved training. This is payable at a maximum rate of $222.10 per fortnight and a minimum rate of $62.90 per fortnight. There is also an independent rate which includes homeless clients. This is payable at the rate of $222.10 per fortnight, plus rent allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of 19 May 20,273 young people were in receipt of youth training allowance. All of those figures, and all of the statements that I have made, prove to me, and I trust to the rest of the House, that the student assistance amendment bill which we are discussing today is well worth while and will always be well worth while. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In summing up, I thank those members who have taken part in the debate. There are a few matters which I really should address and which were raised in the address by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who was critical of the second reading speech for its bureaucratic and excessively legalistic tone and language. I take the opportunity to point out to him the obvious&mdash;which he seems to need to have pointed out to him quite frequently&mdash;that we are talking about a complex legal instrument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about people's rights and obligations under a range of circumstances that can frequently generate quite complex matters. For that reason, we need clarity and precision, because many of the decisions about people's income support can be subject to appeal. The honourable member for Goldstein is, I am sure, aware of that; but, in view of his remarks, I feel that I should place that matter on the record. None of the language in the second reading speech detracts from the fact that the youth training initiative is part of this government's vision for Australia's young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, this is a government that has been responsible for opening up opportunities for young people. We would all be aware that, when the government came to office, fewer than one in three young people completed secondary school. It is now three out of every four who complete their schooling. When this government came to office, there were 16 universities in Australia, almost exclusively located in capital cities. There are now 37 or 38, and the undergraduate population has expanded by some 60 per cent in the last 12 years of Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, of course, we have worked very hard to expand opportunities in TAFE and skills training. This year in the budget, the government is providing over $1 billion, through the states, to expand opportunities in TAFE and training. Honourable members will be interested in one figure: when TAFE and training institutions open their doors in term 1 of next year, there will be 300,000 extra students there because of the additional funding that this government has provided. There will be 300,000 students over and above what the states provide for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as honourable members have pointed out, from then on, armed with skills that are relevant to, and required by, industry, young people these days can feel increasingly confident about their prospects of moving on into employment&mdash;and not into the dead-end jobs that technological change has seen disappear, but into rewarding, interesting and stimulating careers. In other words, this is a government which has transformed opportunities available for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened, in the last 10 days or so, to opposition members talking about `battlers': a species which they seem to have discovered only in recent times. I submit that the real battlers are those young people who could not, during the time of the coalition's period in office, get an education and could not get the skills that industry required to lead on to interesting jobs. Of course, youth unemployment is still too high, but people should be aware of what the statistics mean when they talk about them. Most young people in the age group of 15 to 19 are not in the labour market, but are at school or university or TAFE, or are in training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, for the small numbers of 15- to 19-year-olds who are in the labour market, job prospects are pretty bleak. This is as you would expect, because these are the young people who do not have the skills that industry requires, and because the kinds of unskilled jobs that used to be available to the early school-leavers of 15 years ago and earlier have disappeared as a result of technological change. So youth unemployment is high, but it is a high percentage of a small number, if one measures youth unemployment as a percentage of the age group. I suggest that the 15- to 19-year-olds are a special case, given that so many of them are in education. If one takes that second measure of unemployment as a percentage of those in the age cohort, one sees that that figure, month by month, is roughly the same as unemployment across the entire community. In fact, in recent times, I think it is somewhat less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do my best to help my innumerate friends opposite. I suggest that they have a look at the statistics of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and, particularly, that figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of the youth training initiative is to remove unemployment as an option for young people. It aims to provide them with structured training that is relevant to the needs of industry&mdash;training that will lead them on to employment, and will give them credit transfer into further qualifications. It aims to provide them, at the same time, with income support&mdash;that is, essentially, what this bill deals with&mdash;and to provide them with case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take on board the comments of the honourable member for Goldstein about the way in which the Commonwealth Employment Service sometimes deals with young clients. The Commonwealth Employment Service recognises that it faces a special challenge in this area. That is why it has been government policy to establish as many youth access centres as we can across the country, to make the face of the Commonwealth Employment Service more acceptable, more welcoming and more relevant to young people. Where those youth access centres have been established, they have been able to do the job a little better&mdash;in many cases, a lot better&mdash;than the normal Commonwealth Employment Service job centre has been able to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has also been recognised by the government in its case management response. The job of the case managers is to work with young people, to agree on what each young person wants and needs in order to gain the skills to get a job. Case managers recognise that young people on the youth training allowance may not have completed a full secondary education. Therefore, part of their task is to undertake a detailed needs assessment of those young people, so that they are able to make flexible and appropriate use of labour market programs, and to help them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be a question of attending to their basic literacy and numeracy needs, for example. It might be a matter of providing transport assistance. It might be a matter of arranging specialist counselling. The kind of assistance that has been provided in a pilot form under the JPET program&mdash;to which the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) referred&mdash;is being embraced under the case management regime. The essential element of case management which particularly applies to young people&mdash;who, I agree, all too often suffer a sense of alienation&mdash;is working on a one-to-one basis and working with the particular person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I was a little mystified by the honourable member for Goldstein's concern that this bill may not have been appropriately referred to the Main Committee for consideration. I am told that matters are only referred to this chamber when there is an agreement between government and opposition. That is what I am told. If there is a problem, I think it is probably one that the honourable member for Goldstein should take up with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith). </PARA>

<PARA>The government amendments will add provisions to the bill in relation to compensation recovery and the parental income test. I will turn to compensation recovery first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensation recovery provisions in division 12 of part VIII of the act seek to avoid dual payments of income support and compensation in certain circumstances. The government amendments would make changes to schedule 4 of the bill, which contains amendments to the compensation recovery provisions in division 12 of part VIII of the act. The government amendments would ensure that payments of certain types of pensions, benefits or allowances which were paid to a person's partner under the Social Security Act 1991 but had been superseded by other types of pensions, benefits and allowances could be recovered under the compensation recovery provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendments would also simplify the compensation recovery rules in section 229 and 233 of the act. Currently, the compensation recovery provisions require a person to be qualified for youth training allowance. Therefore, a decision must first be made about whether a person is qualified for the payment, even though it may be obvious from the person's circumstances that he or she will be precluded from payment because of the compensation recovery provisions. However, a claimant for the allowance and the department are each put to the inconvenience and cost of qualification assessment for no practical purpose. These amendments would remove the requirement that a person be qualified for youth training allowance before the compensation recovery provisions can operate. The government's amendments which relate to compensation recovery are similar to other amendments already made by the bill to other provisions of division 12 of part A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the parental income test, the government's amendments would also remove a technical difficulty which has been discovered in the application of the loan fringe benefits provisions of the parental income test. That test is relevant to calculating the rate at which the person receives youth training allowance. For these provisions to operate properly, a yearly notional interest rate should have been prescribed by regulation. No regulation was made. If a regulation had been made, the rates would have been the same as the rates inserted by schedule 11. The need for a regulation in the future has been removed by the amendments to be made by schedule 11. Any possible anomalies in the manner in which the loan fringe benefits provision have been currently applied are to be removed by the government amendments. </PARA>

I made the comment then, and I repeat it now, that the fact that additional amendments are still coming through at this late stage only reinforces the view that this whole Heath Robinsonesque system which the government is constructing in its efforts to help unemployed people is being invented on the run.

So we will see a continuing debate on the proper form of this bill. It is important that the measures which the government is putting forward in these additional amendments and in the main bill be seen to effectively assist unemployed people, particularly unemployed young people, and recognise the seriousness of the problem. In every other area of statistics, and particularly the unemployment statistics, the government sticks scrupulously to international definitions of unemployment. By those definitions, if a person is employed one hour during the week, that person is considered as employed and not unemployed. The government makes sure that that definition is implemented and reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is the case, I understand, that if a person is employed one hour in the course of a year, that person cannot be considered under those definitions to be long-term unemployed, even though that person may be unemployed for the whole of the remainder of the year. That one hour's employment cuts that person out of the statistics. This is part of the general rigging of the statistics, from the point of view of giving the public an accurate impression, although the government will defend itself on the basis that these are the rigorous international definitions.

<PARA>The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 contains a range of measures announced in the budget to amend the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The amendments are principally designed to tighten the eligibility criteria for rebates of customs or excise duty which have been paid on purchases of diesel fuel, so that the integrity of the scheme as it was introduced in 1982 to assist those engaged in mainstream primary production and those engaged in mainstream mining operations can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last year in particular, as a result of a series of legal challenges, eligibility definitions in the scheme have been subjected to considerable expansion. This has pointed to ambiguities in the interpretation of these definitions, which demand urgent remedial attention so as to prevent the exploitation of the scheme and a consequential drain on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four principal changes to the scheme proposed by the bill involve:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16"> (I)the abolition of the `residential premises' category from rebate eligibility, from 1 July 1995;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16"> (II)the confirmation of the definition of `agriculture' in the Customs Act 1901 to exclude from rebate eligibility activities which might loosely be described under the phrase `amenity agriculture', from 1 August 1986;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">(III)the narrowing of the definition of `minerals' in the Customs Act 1901 so as to exclude from rebate eligibility diesel fuel used in the mining for minerals, where those operations simply involve the extraction of sand, sandstone, soil, clay, granite, water and the like, from 1 August 1986; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16"> (IV)the amendment of the definitions of `agriculture' and `mining operations' in the Customs Act 1901 to specify a clear list of activities in which the use of diesel fuel is to be eligible for the payment of rebate, from 1 August 1986. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abolition of the category of `residential premises'</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this amendment is to reduce government outlays by limiting rebate eligibility to diesel fuel used for residential premises on agricultural properties and in mining operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been mindful that the removal of rebate eligibility for this category may present an additional financial burden on the operation of farming properties and on individuals engaging in mining operations. For these reasons, rebate will continue to be paid on diesel fuel purchased for use for domestic purposes:</PARA>
<PARA>.at residential premises on the farms of individuals engaging in agriculture; and</PARA>
<PARA>.at residential premises of individuals engaging in mining operations. </PARA>
<PARA>In proposing this amendment, the government has also been mindful of the adverse effects the abolition of this category would have on indigenous communities in Australia. As a result, separate compensation arrangements in the order of $1.8 million per year will be put in place to ensure that indigenous communities are not disadvantaged by the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed abolition of the category of `residential premises' and the introduction of the new and related categories under `agriculture' and `mining operations' in items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 of schedule 1 to the bill are proposed to have effect in respect of diesel fuel purchased on or after 1 July 1995. Diesel fuel purchased before 1 July 1995 will continue to be rebatable under the current legislative provisions. Recurring savings as a result of these measures are in the order of $11.8 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining three amendments proposed by the bill are intended to clarify the ambit and integrity of the scheme as it was introduced in 1982. The government is firmly of the view that the scheme was never intended to pay rebate on diesel fuel used in activities that might only loosely be described as encouraging mining operations or primary production in a general sense. Rather, in the government's view, the scheme was designed to pay rebate to primary producers who use diesel fuel in the act of growing or gathering in of crops, or the rearing of livestock, and in other activities that are sufficiently connected with agriculture or, in relation to mining operations, to pay rebate for fuel used in the act of exploring or prospecting for minerals, and their subsequent mining and beneficiation, or in the liquefaction of natural gas or the production of common salt. The series of three amendments described below proceed on that basis, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">II)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confirming the scope of the definition of `agriculture'</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, an appeal was heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a decision of the Australian Customs Service to refuse the payment of rebate on diesel fuel used to carry out `amenity agriculture', such as the mowing of lawns and sports grounds and the maintenance of golf courses. In September 1994, the tribunal decided that the decision of  Customs to not pay rebate was correct, but the matter is currently on appeal to the Federal Court. Items 4 and 10 of schedule 1 to the bill are proposed to remove any doubt that these kinds of activities are intended to fall outside of the act's definition of `agriculture', and thus are not to be given the benefit of rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular amendments will ensure the continuation of rebate payments for diesel fuel used in carrying out agricultural activities for the purposes of a business undertaken to obtain produce for sale. At the same time, they will ensure that amenity agriculture of the type carried out by local or state governments, parks and gardens organisations and sporting clubs and individuals is excluded from the definition of `agriculture' in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because these issues have arisen as a result of efforts by users of diesel fuel to broaden the scope of the scheme well beyond what the government believes was intended, the government is proposing that this amendment be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue. It is from this date that purchases of diesel fuel made after that date can be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without such retrospectivity, there is a likelihood that claims which are pending the outcome of a Federal Court appeal will result in the payment of rebate of up to $40 million. In addition, recurring savings in the order of $15 million per year are anticipated from this change. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">III)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Narrowing the definition of `minerals'</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court have held the view that the term `mining for minerals' in the act's definition of `mining operations' introduced a purposive test requiring a rebate claimant to demonstrate that the purpose of the claimant's operations was to obtain a mineral or minerals embedded in the material that was extracted. For instance, there was a clear distinction between the extraction of sand per se and the extraction of sand with a view to obtaining from it minerals such as rutile, zircon or almandite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meaning of `mining operations' was therefore considered to be reasonably well settled until a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the issue of extracting sand for use in the making of concrete or for use as bedding sand in the construction industry. The tribunal decided that the extraction of such sand was eligible for rebate. Claims have also been received for rebate on diesel fuel used in the pumping of ground water to be supplied as drinking water to towns. These are, in the government's view, uses well beyond the intent of the scheme, which was and is to deliver an assistance measure to mainstream mining pursuits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, in item 7 of schedule 1 to the bill, the government has proposed to amend the definition of `minerals' to exclude sand, sandstone, soil, slate, clay (other than bentonite or kaolin), basalt, granite, gravel, limestone and water. The exclusion is consistent with the principal mining legislation of the states and would bring about a transparent distinction between mining for minerals and operations that cannot, in the ordinary sense, be regarded as mining. Where these materials are extracted for the purpose of recovering a mineral, the extraction will remain eligible for rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing that this amendment be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before the break for the division, in the existing legislation, both the definition of `agriculture' and the definition of `mining operations' employ what are known as `sweeper clauses', which have the effect of making other operations connected with agriculture or mining eligible for the payment of rebate. The interpretation of these `sweeper clauses' has been a main source of contention over the years, and has generated most of the litigation in the lifetime of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in items 4 and 8 of schedule 1 to the bill are to remove the subjectivity associated with the `sweeper clauses', and to replace those clauses with an objective list of activities that are eligible for rebate. This has been done with a view to giving claimants certainty as to the actual activities that are eligible for rebate, and thereby avoiding the costly litigation concerning eligibility circumstances which has plagued the scheme in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that, although the proposed amendments will necessarily narrow the range of activities for which rebate is payable, farmers and miners will generally be unaffected. The intention of these amendments is to put beyond doubt that the scheme is not meant to provide rebate eligibility for activities which are not sufficiently connected with mining or agriculture; for instance, the provision of a service or utility to a farmer or miner, such as electricity through a grid, or the building of a dam which is intended to supply water to, amongst others, farmers, or the operation of a garbage tip on a former mine site by someone other than the miner, where the resultant filling of the mine site is said to be the rehabilitation of a mine site, and thus connected with a mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because claims of these kinds have sought to broaden the scheme well beyond what it should be, the government is proposing that these amendments be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On budget night, the government proudly and loudly declared that it would leave the diesel fuel rebate scheme intact. After the controversy and the public debate leading up to budget night, with industry fearing that the diesel fuel rebate scheme would be curtailed or even abolished, the government's announcement was met with a great deal of relief and was endorsed by industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we now find that several substantial changes have been proposed by the government to determine eligibility for claiming rebates under the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The present structure of the scheme dates from 1 August 1986 and gives a rebate of petroleum products excise to certain classes of off-road diesel users. Originally, petroleum products excise was intended to pay for road funding, but as road funding now comprises only eight per cent of the total revenue from the excise, the link is irretrievably broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the breakdown of hypothecation, the excise is best considered as an intermediate tax on a business input. That is how this debate should be framed. Any alterations to the diesel fuel rebate scheme is a change to an intermediate business input. At present, the excise on diesel fuel in round figures is 32.5c per litre. The government expects to recoup $3.9 billion from diesel excise alone in 1995-96, which is an increase of nine per cent on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the scheme, eligible primary producers receive a rebate of the full excise, namely 32.5c per litre, while eligible mining operations receive a rebate of 30.1c per litre, so effectively they pay an excise of 2.4c per litre. Other rebatable users receive a rebate of 24.8c per litre, so effectively they pay 7.8c per litre in excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which is now before the chamber, I wish to consider the aspect of retrospectivity, as there are retrospective elements of this bill common to several measures. We need to consider this issue separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) outlined in the second reading speech, the government argues that retrospectivity is required to limit its liability from piggyback claims. These claims arise because decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court have broadened the scope of eligible rebatable activities beyond that originally intended. This gives other claimants the opportunity to claim rebates they were not eligible for before the relevant AAT or court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several points to consider. Revenue is the prime motive for this retrospectivity, as acknowledged by the government in the second reading speech. Increasing imposts on business is more electorally saleable for the Labor government than increasing other taxes. On the government's own estimates, it will gain at least $86 million retrospectively from these measures. So the government's prime motivation is revenue raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retrospectivity extends nine years, to 1 August 1986. I would have thought that was ample time and gave plenty of opportunity to clarify the operation of the scheme. Retrospective legislation brings uncertainty to the environment in which business operates, particularly where the motive is unambiguously revenue raising. Good government demands a predictable framework for investment. The bill before the chamber will overturn several decisions of the AAT and the courts, to the financial disadvantage of the claimants, and will abort other decisions in process. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But what about all those claimants who have gone to the considerable expense of exercising their legal right to challenge legislation? They will be cut off in midstream, and there is no suggestion by the government that it will compensate claimants for the legal expenses incurred to date. So I just cannot accept the government's discrimination against claimants according to the stage of legal proceedings. If you have completed it, you are home and hosed; if you are under way at present, you are cut off at the socks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the entitlement to test the meaning of legislation before the AAT or courts is fundamental to our legal system, it is at the heart of an individual's or a company's rights. After all, there is no element of illegality or fraud to justify the retrospectivity, as there was for the removal of the bottom of the harbour tax schemes. Companies have gone to considerable expense to contest decisions in the AAT and courts which will be overturned now by this legislation. In effect, industry is being asked to pay for the consequences of poorly drafted eligibility provisions and government inaction for nine years. Therefore, the coalition opposes the retrospectivity elements of the legislation and the coalition in the Senate will move to amend the measures to commence at 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995, being the budget announcement. We accept that it is appropriate to follow the convention of making the measures retrospective to budget night to contain any windfall gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking now at the specific proposals of the bill in the same order that the parliamentary secretary did, the abolition of the category of residential premises will start from 1 July 1995, so there is no contentious retrospectivity here. The measure effectively removes the eligibility of residential premises for rebate, except those residential premises associated with agriculture and mining. To offset the added impost on remote indigenous communities, the parliamentary secretary has announced compensation measures of $1.8 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got a number of problems with this. The first and major one is that we have not been told, because the government either cannot or will not tell us, how many individuals in remote and rural communities will be affected. We already know that the government concedes that the indigenous communities will need compensation, but what about non-Aboriginal Australians? Until we get that information, we are not prepared to support this measure. We do know from Customs, in some of the excellent briefings it has provided, that, of the total of approximately 14,500 claims received in 1992-93 under this category, 13,500 are individuals. The remaining 1,000 claimants are largely hospitals, nursing homes, medical institutions and aged care homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs advises me that it believes that the private individuals, the 13,500 we speak of, tend to be in the cities or larger centres. Otherwise they would usually claim the agricultural rebate, if living in rural or remote areas. But we are not convinced of that. We have received some anecdotal advice from rural communities and farmers' groups that there are a great many more individuals in rural and remote areas claiming this diesel rebate than Customs may think. Customs has done its best to identify the groups affected, other than indigenous communities, as companies providing crew quarters on coastal trading ships, council run caravan parks or workers' camps, resort proprietors providing staff accommodation, prison services, staff accommodation provided by state governments, private caravan parks, private ski clubs and private individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are still very short on detail. It is the opposition's intention to refer this issue to a Senate Friday committee to allow potentially affected groups to put their case. We will, by way of amendment, if there are a large number of rural and remote individuals affected, move an amendment in the Senate so that they continue to receive the diesel fuel rebate, on the basis that they have no alternative energy source. We accept and understand that the diesel fuel rebate should no longer be available for urban residential premises&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or give them the subsidy as the Industry Commission report No. 40 of July 1994 on petroleum products recommended. The commission recommended the total abolition of the diesel fuel rebate scheme and said that it believed that a subsidy should be given, as has been done for indigenous communities. We believe that by way of either subsidy or the rebate scheme we should continue to provide for those who have no alternative energy source to diesel fuel generators. In urban areas there is an alternative in reticulated gas lines or electricity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the purpose of the Friday Senate hearing and it may be, as the parliamentary secretary interjected, that it would be better to provide for those remote and isolated rural dwellers by way of subsidy. That is something that we are happy to consider but we draw a distinction between those two categories of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking now at the exclusion of amenity agriculture from the definition of agricultural activities eligible for rebate, this measure is to be retrospective to 1 August 1986, and I have already spoken on that issue. The coalition will oppose the retrospectivity element of this part of the bill. However, we will support the remainder of the measure. We do not oppose future abolition of the rebate for amenity agriculture for the reasons the parliamentary secretary has outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the amendment before the chamber was prompted by a claim for rebate made by the city of Nunawading in September 1994 for mowing reserves and nature strips. The government won in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but the case is now on appeal in the Federal Court and we believe that should be able to proceed. However, we are as concerned as the government that there not be any future expansion of the diesel fuel rebate scheme for amenity agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking now at the third section of the bill, narrowing the definition of minerals, again it is to be retrospective from 1 August 1986, which we oppose. Moreover, we oppose the measure. We have thought long and hard about this and have decided that there is no fundamental reason why some extractive industries should be provided with diesel fuel rebates and others not. We do not accept the delineation between quarrying and mining that the government proposes. I have taken advice on this and the methodology involved in quarrying is identical in almost all respects, if not all respects, to open-cut mining. So we believe the operations involved in quarrying are so identical to those carried out in mining operations that they should continue to receive the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking now at the fourth and final section of the bill, the tightening of definitions of agricultural and mining operations, again the measure is to be retrospective to 1 August 1986, which we will oppose in the Senate. The amendments will define tightened lists of activities eligible for rebate relating to mining and agriculture so that rebate for agricultural activities will be restricted to diesel fuel purchased for use in preparation of the soil, the act of growing primary produce or rearing of livestock and other connected activities. Rebate for mining activities will be restricted to exploring, prospecting, subsequent treatment and processing of minerals and other activities such as the liquefaction of natural gas and production of salt by evaporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fair bit of confusion in just how this amendment will operate. There are a number of legal opinions still being obtained and being presented by the mining and agricultural industries on the interpretation of the legislation. There are some representations being made by the mining industry that this measure will reduce payments of rebate currently allowed for rehabilitation of mining operations, transport activities, pumping of water and the generation of electricity. The parliamentary secretary has gone some way to allaying fears in his second reading speech when he argued that the proposed amendments, whilst narrowing the range of activities for which the rebate is payable, will not affect those activities which are sufficiently connected with mining or agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He gave examples which I could agree with. The first was the provision of electricity through a grid. We would not believe that the diesel fuel rebates should be available for that activity. He included the building of a dam which is intended to supply water to, amongst others, farmers. We also would not believe that that is sufficiently connected to genuine mining or agricultural activities. However, he gives another example that I would like to take further advice on, just to illustrate that this is not yet a settled point, at least not so far as the coalition is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He gives the example `the operation of a garbage tip on a former mine site by someone other than the miner, where the resultant filling of the mine site is said to be the rehabilitation of a mine site, and thus connected with a mining operation.' At first glance, if the mining company had made a contractual arrangement with an operator of a garbage tip to fill in the hole and so satisfy rehabilitation requirements of state authorities, that may well be a genuine activity connected to mining. After all, rehabilitation of mining sites is undoubtedly part of a mining venture. So we will support the narrowing of the eligibility for the rebate where there are clear-cut examples, but we will oppose reductions in the level of rebate paid to genuine mining operations. So we still have some work&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Lindsay" NAMEID="OG4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will decide in between here and the Senate. There is still a fair bit of work ahead of us as the interpretations of the bill's provisions are made available to us. But at the moment we are not satisfied that the legislation will curtail only non-mining activities. For instance, there is one legal opinion which states that a train carrying ore from Mount Tom Price in the Pilbara to Port Hedland would receive the diesel fuel rebate, but on the return journey, the ore having been off-loaded, the train would not receive the diesel fuel rebate on the basis that it is not engaged in a mining activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the rebate available for agricultural activities, here too, there are some serious differences of interpretation. We have advice that the agricultural industry will be hit in regard to contractors operating on properties. For instance, a contractor transporting stock from one end of a large pastoral property to the other will not receive the diesel fuel rebate, and some questions have been raised in regard to other off-road activities. The Customs Service has been very good in providing some legal advice on these issues, but I have to advise the government that it has not satisfied some of our experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, we also wish to refer this aspect of the legislation to a Senate Friday committee. We want to hold the government to its assurances that those involved in genuine agricultural activities will continue to receive the diesel fuel rebate. We would believe that a contractor acting in place of a farmer, or standing in the shoes of a farmer, should receive the diesel fuel rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in summary, in amending the eligibility provisions of the diesel fuel rebate scheme for farmers and miners, the bill unjustifiably attempts to retain past revenue by legislating retrospectively for nine years to override adverse decisions on rebate claims in the AAT in courts. As well, the bill effectively increases taxes on the essential export industries of mining and agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the bill. This is a budget measure so it is always useful to start at the appropriate place, which is Budget Paper No. 1. In the course of his contribution, the previous speaker, the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), referred to these measures as having revenue as their motive. Unfortunately for him, they actually turn up in the outlays section of the budget and that is a most appropriate first point. We are not talking about revenue here; we are talking about outlays. We are talking about writing a Commonwealth cheque and giving it to people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for these provisions is Budget Paper No. 1, chapter 3, page 162 under mining and mineral resources. I will quote this for the benefit of the member for Gippsland and others. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outlays under this function provide development assistance to the mining and manufacturing sectors to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth provides assistance in the form of grants, subsidies, bounties, direct project involvement, price support and adjustment schemes, contributions to research and promotion and export development costs, and services to industry provided by some departments and organisations either free of charge or at a charge which do not fully recover the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA>In Budget Paper No. 1 there is a chart which shows the trends of outlays in this particular area. When we look at the trend shown on page 162 using 1989-90 dollars or prices as a constant, we find we are talking about anywhere between $1 billion to $2 billion of Commonwealth revenue. This particular year of the 1995-96 budget roughly comes in at about $1.7 billion. The budget paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major influences on outlays trends between 1985-86 and 1998-99 include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an estimated increase in real terms of 9.7% in outlays in the mining sector mainly as a result of an increase in Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) payments to mining operators . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This one cannot be couched as being a measure which is perniciously taking everything away from this sector. This is a major Commonwealth outlay and we are talking about figures in the order of $1 billion to $2 billion of outlays. The budget paper is expressly referring to the diesel fuel rebate scheme on page 3.164. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Scheme provides for an excise rebate on diesel fuel used for off road purposes in mining operations. Outlays will increase during the period of the forward estimates as a result of increased consumption of diesel fuel and the effect of periodic indexation adjustment of the excise rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DFRS will be amended to exclude from the scope of the scheme certain activities which are not considered to be genuine mining operations and were not part of the original scope of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>That gets to the heart of these measures. I have referred to the relevant extracts on the scheme in the outlays measures, but when we come to focus on the 1994-95 estimates for outlays in this particular area we find that the estimate for outlays for the rebate payments is in the order of $1.2 billion. That is the breadth and the scope of this scheme. When we look at the figures which are littered through the explanatory memorandum or the second reading speeches, we can see the small proportions that we are talking about in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put the matter in context for the benefit of my colleague and sometimes friend the member for Gippsland, let us get to the heart of these measures. In the end it gets down to the retrospective aspects. Retrospectivity is something which legislators should always approach with caution, but that is not to say that it should never be done, that there are never good reasons for doing it. As we go through the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary, the intellectual rationale for the retrospectivity in this area is there. I want to quote from the parliamentary secretary's speech. At its beginning he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are principally designed to tighten the eligibility criteria for rebates of customs or excise duty which have been paid on purchases of diesel fuel, so that the integrity of the scheme as it was introduced in 1982 to assist those engaged in mainstream primary production and those engaged in mainstream mining operations, can be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the last year in particular, as a result of a series of legal challenges, eligibility definitions in the scheme have been subjected to considerable expansion. This has pointed to ambiguities in the interpretation of these definitions, which demand urgent remedial attention so as to prevent the exploitation of the scheme and a consequential drain on the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA>So what is the rationale for the retrospective aspects in this area? Again, I refer to the parliamentary secretary's words in the second reading speech where he talks about `the integrity of the scheme'; about ensuring that it `can be maintained'; about `eligibility definitions . . . have been subjected to considerable expansion'; about `ambiguities in the interpretation . . . which demand urgent remedial attention'. As we go through the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech, we find these themes constantly recurring. I again quote from his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is firmly of the view that the scheme was never intended to pay rebate on diesel fuel used in activities that might only loosely be described as encouraging mining operations or primary production in a general sense. Rather, in the government's view, the scheme was designed to pay rebate to primary producers who use diesel fuel in the act of growing and gathering in of crops, or the rearing of livestock . . . </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Lindsay" NAMEID="OG4">

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and in other activities that are sufficiently connected with agriculture or, in relation to mining operations, to pay rebate for fuel used in the act of exploring or prospecting for minerals, and their subsequent mining and beneficiation, or in the liquefaction of natural gas or the production of common salt.</PARA>
<PARA>The parliamentary secretary's second reading speech then refers to appeals and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The member for Gippsland said that those opposite would make up their minds on some of the detail of this between here and the Senate. Well, I assume they will go via the AAT or some other court rather than having the capacity to make these policy judgments themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again quote from the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech on the retrospectivity aspect. I do not think there is any dispute about those aspects of the bill which come into play on 1 July 1995. Towards the conclusion of his speech, the parliamentary secretary says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is proposing that this amendment be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue. Without such retrospectivity, there is a likelihood that the claim which is pending the outcome of a Federal Court appeal will result in the payment of rebate of up to $91 million. In addition, recurring savings in the order of $20 million are anticipated from this change.</PARA>
<PARA>He is there, of course, referring to the narrowing of the definition of minerals. He then goes through what are referred to as the `sweeper' clause and concludes, when he is dealing with the `sweeper' clause, by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because claims of these kinds have sought to broaden the scheme well beyond what it should be, the government is proposing that these amendments be made retrospective to 1 August 1986, in order to protect the revenue. Without such retrospectivity, there is a likelihood that claims which are pending the outcome of several Federal Court appeals and one High Court application will result in the payment of rebate of up to $30 million. In addition, recurring savings in the order of $7 million are anticipated from these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noted with regard to the 3 proposed series of amendments which I have out</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lined and which it is proposed have a retrospective commencement, that any rebates that have been paid since 1 August 1986 are to remain intact, and are to be treated as validly paid. This is explicitly stated in clause 5 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>I finish on that point because it is quite clear there is no effort or attempt at clawback here. This was one of the concerns raised directly with me by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies representatives when I met with them late last week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the parliamentary secretary interjects, clause 5 makes that expressly and explicitly clear. So where have we got to in this particular measure? In the end it gets down to the retrospective aspect of the bill. As I said at the beginning, retrospectivity is something which should be treated with caution. That is not to say that it should never occur. People should only do it for good reason and when they do it they should do it in an up-front way. There is no question that the bill and the government have been absolutely up-front here. That was made expressly clear in the second reading speech when the parliamentary secretary, in his comments on the financial impact statement of this particular measure, referred to one-off retrospective savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no attempt to sneak some retrospective measure in here. There is no intent to retrospectively claw back from those claims that have already been decided on. There is no attempt at clawing back at all. In the end it gets down to whether, on balance, one believes that the integrity of the scheme, the retention of the integrity of the scheme, and the protection of the outlay and revenue aspects that follow from that, warrant or justify the retrospective application of these measures. In the government's view&mdash;and it is reflected by the bill&mdash;on balance, that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to representatives of AMEC having made some representations to me directly in the course of last week. In addition to the retrospective point which was part of their representations, they provided me with a paper, which I am sure other members have seen, of their concerns which go to two aspects. Some go to policy; others go to drafting of the particular bill itself. Together with the parliamentary secretary I was happy to ensure that representatives of AMEC were put directly with drafting officers from the relevant departments to see whether their concerns are drafting concerns which can be overcome or rectified between now and the introduction of the bill into the other place. Some of the concerns expressed by AMEC may well be solved by drafting measures. </PARA>

We are talking of outlays between $1 billion and $2 billion&mdash;as I have gone through in Budget Paper No. 1. On the 1994-95 estimates for this particular scheme we are talking in terms of $1.2 billion. That puts these particular measures into context. The whole thrust of the retrospective measures that the bill contains is to ensure that the integrity of this scheme, as introduced, is held to that precise and particular purpose. The three series of amendments which affect that are, on balance, able to be applied in a retrospective way to ensure the integrity and principle of the scheme as introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 May this year. If in referring the bill to the Main Committee it was assumed to be non-contentious, I think the Chief Government Whip needs a new definition of `non-contentious'. The bill is very much in contention. For different reasons which the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has outlined, the coalition opposes part of it and, for other reasons, seeks to have parts of it examined by a Senate committee. My focus is on one issue only: the bill effectively imposes taxes retrospectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before 1982 diesel fuel used for off-road purposes was not subject to the payment of any customs duty or excise. This led to certain abuses in which untaxed diesel fuel became used for on-road consumption. To prevent loss of revenue and the abuse of the exemption, the government announced in the 1982-83 budget that excise would be imposed on all diesel fuel but a rebate would be allowed in respect of legitimate off-road use. Consumers eligible for the rebate included primary producers, miners and operators of residential nursing and aged persons homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial intention of the rebate scheme was to allow a full rebate of the excise paid for eligible users, but from 1983 various claimants were eligible for less than a 100 per cent rebate. In the 1994-95 budget, the estimated value of rebates payable to primary producers in that financial year was $515.7 million and for those conducting mining operations the rebate value was estimated at $632.1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill, the government proposes to make four amendments to the Customs Act 1901. The bill would remove the eligibility for the payment of rebate of customs duty in respect of the use of diesel fuel at residential premises. Secondly, the bill would narrow the definition of `minerals' in the Customs Act to exclude from rebate eligibility diesel fuel used in mining for materials that are more valuable for use in their own right&mdash;for example, sand, sandstone, soil, clay, granite and water&mdash;than for their inherent mineral worth. Thirdly, the bill seeks to ensure that rebate of customs and excise duty is payable only where the diesel fuel is for use in an activity strictly included in the definition of `agriculture' and not just in what is described as `amenity agriculture'. Finally, the proposals would remove from the definitions of `agriculture' and `mining operations' activities `connected with' mining and primary production, and insert a clear list of activities in which the use of diesel fuel is to be eligible for payment of rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes amendments to the Excise Act 1901 to remove the eligibility for the payment of rebate of excise duty for diesel fuel used at residential premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be noted that each of these amendments is in itself significant and substantive. They could not, by any stretch of imagination, be described merely as interpretations. They represent significant changes to the law defining the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments removing customs duty would, if enacted, have effect retrospectively from 1 August 1986, the date on which the diesel fuel rebate scheme commenced. This extends the reach of the government's taxing grab back some nine years before this bill becomes law. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who suggested that this bill is not a revenue raising measure, is merely quibbling with words, because effectively it is. It simply raises revenue by removing rebates on levies where the rebates have been paid up to now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the explanatory memorandum, the government states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are proposed to clarify the ambit of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) as being a targeted scheme intended to provide rebate of duty paid on diesel fuel used by those who are genuinely involved in the business of mining or farming, or those who undertake activities that are intimately bound up with mining or farming. This intention is implicit in paragraph 164(1)(a) and (aa) of the Customs Act, which provides that rebate is payable in respect of diesel fuel purchased for use in mining operations and in primary production.</PARA>
<PARA>I think I have already pointed out that this is not merely a clarification. The amendments that the government seeks to make are significant. The explanatory memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rebate was originally intended to be payable to those who the ordinary person would have considered to be `farmers' and `miners'. However, as the years have progressed, various decisions of courts and tribunals have expanded the ambit of DFRS to the extent that many activities that should never have been regarded as being eligible to receive rebate have received, and continue to receive, rebate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not arguing about the original policy. The original policy was expressed in the language of the act as interpreted by the courts. But what the government is seeking to do here is to rewrite history. It has a penchant for rewriting history. It is doing it in this case in a way that takes away the rights of Australians, and takes away their money, retrospectively. Users of diesel fuel in the years since August 1986, when DFRS began, were entitled to arrange their affairs according to the law as it existed at the time, and as it has existed in the nine years that have ensued since then. It is a fundamental principle of our legal system that laws are made to have prospective operation and not retrospective operation. It is simply unjust and oppressive to subject citizens to a law they have no means of ascertaining simply because the law has not been conceived, drafted, debated or enacted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable for the government to assert, as it does in the explanatory memorandum, that the law will have effect as if for the last nine years it had meant what, in the opinion of the author of the explanatory memorandum, a so-called `ordinary' person would have thought it meant. Under our legal system, laws mean what parliament intended them to mean. The task of deciding what parliament intended a particular law to mean, when there is any doubt about it, is entrusted to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our system is a democracy subject to the rule of law. If the government cannot draft its legislation properly, it must redraft it and go forward from there. This attempt to rewrite history is outrageous and should be resisted. The Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, referring to this particular bill, said, in respect of the retrospectivity, that this clearly trespasses on the basic right that those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says at the relevant time and according to what the law means at that time as declared by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the government is seeking to make these retrospective amendments to the law because it has been too lax to introduce prospective amendments years ago, then it has caused the revenue to forgo possible savings of $86 million. In the words of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Impact Statement in the explanatory memorandum indicates that the one-off retrospective savings amounting to $86 million are 3 times the $27 million savings for 1995-96 for the same categories.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a matter of grave concern if this position has been reached because for up to 3 years the executive has refrained from administering the rebate according to the law as declared by the courts, forcing applicants for the rebate into court action to obtain their rights.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the application of the bill is that if it is passed it will apply to rebate applications not yet determined at the time the bill receives the royal assent. Rebate applications that are before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and not yet determined by the tribunal will be subject to the provisions of the bill. So while the past rebate claims of some entities which have already been paid will not have to be disgorged under the provisions of this bill, any claims that have not yet been paid or are the subject of an appeal before the courts or the AAT will be denied by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That will remove the entitlement to the rebate from some companies and individuals and not from others on a totally arbitrary and therefore unjust basis. It is worse than arbitrary, because it is within the power of the government to not determine an application and thereby subject it to the retrospective operation of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read subsection 5(iv) of the bill, it presents the extraordinary situation that an applicant for a rebate could have had it denied and then argued a case before the AAT and lost, argued it before the Federal Court of Australia and lost, and then appealed to the High Court of Australia. After argument had been completed there and the decision reserved, the applicant could find that the law had changed under his feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is even worse than that. He could have succeeded before the AAT and the Federal Court. He could have then been the subject of an appeal to the High Court where the case is argued on an appeal brought by the Commonwealth, and, because the Commonwealth is appealing, the retrospectivity will bite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between now and 1 July, the Commonwealth can effectively deny entitlement to anybody who has a case before the tribunals or courts by simply lodging an appeal against a decision against the Commonwealth. That is arbitrary, if ever anything was. In the context of a revenue raising measure it is totally extraordinary. I am, frankly, dumbfounded by the simplistic justification that the government offers. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) has effectively explained that the retrospective operation is specifically designed to defeat litigation&mdash;currently before the courts&mdash;which the government expects to lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another facet of the foolishness of retrospective legislation is demonstrated by this bill. As the Business Council of Australia pointed out on Monday, 5 June 1995, by using retrospective legislation to overturn a law that has been in place for nearly a decade, the federal government will only send the wrong signal to both domestic and foreign investors in Australia about Australia's position as a nation with low sovereign risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a technique, the retrospectivity which this bill seeks to put in place is totally objectionable. If a department or a government does not like an interpretation by a court or does not accept the need to change the legislation prospectively, but wants to change it administratively, this bill presents it with the opportunity of doing so, simply by enabling it to deny an application for a privilege, concession or rebate. It can do that in the face of the law and then, by using numbers, it can seek to change the law retrospectively. One can only hope that the Senate has more sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of the retrospective operation of this particular piece of legislation is so ham-fisted it begs belief. It is made worse because it has an arbitrary operation. The government has appealed to what an ordinary person would think. In my opinion, no right thinking person could support the retrospective operation of this proposed legislation, no matter how much the person supported the substance of the change. </PARA>

Each of the speakers has dealt with the matter of litigation and the issue of retrospectivity. The explanatory memorandum makes it quite clear that the payment of rebate on diesel fuel was originally intended by the Fraser government to be made to those persons who are involved in the mainstream of mining as understood by the common person. This intention is explicit in the terms of paragraph 164(1)(a) of the Customs Act which provides eligibility for the payment of rebate in respect of diesel fuel for use in mining operations. It then goes on to deal with a further explanation of that description.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of the scheme in 1982, 168 cases have been litigated before the AAT and finalised. Some of the cases progressed to the Federal Court on appeal; 95 cases have been litigated since 1990. A small proportion of cases dealt with the core definitions of mining operations or primary production, but the majority of challenges were in respect of the interpretation of the sweeper clauses and the definitions of mining operations and agriculture which allow rebate to be paid on diesel fuel used to carry out operations that are connected with mining or agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension, I was saying that, generally speaking, claimants under the sweeper clauses are service or transport contractors. But this is not to say that they are never miners or farmers: clearly, many of them are. But, in respect of sweeper clauses, the Federal Court has stated that, for an activity to be connected with agriculture or mining, the connection must be sufficient, more than tenuous. The court has also said that one thing must be bound up with another, that a connection must be real and substantial. That has been the law, as it has been understood, for a long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent case of Cowell Electric Supply Co., the Federal Court has abandoned these tests and has said that one can look at spatial, temporal, economic and mechanical factors and that the set of factors which bears upon the issue is open. The question of what is connected with this has become so subjective that it is almost like asking how long a piece of string is. This makes determining eligibility for diesel fuel rebate difficult for administrators and presents a real risk of inconsistency. It can be unfair to claimants because they cannot plan their financial affairs with any degree of certainty and, indeed, substantial resources are spent in trying to obtain such certainty and in trying to second-guess the AAT or the Federal Court on these issues, where there is little consensus between Customs and the claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with this issue on the question of time. In the city of Nunawading case referred to by the member for Gippsland, there was a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in September 1994. As I am informed, that was the first successful appeal in that area. There are 967 notices of intention currently held. They present no cost to the claimants except the cost of postage. For example, the Neumann Sands case was an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case in February 1995. The Water Authority of Western Australia case was 30 May 1995 and the case of the Cowell Electric Supply Co. was a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in January 1995. This legislation has been in effect since 1982 so these decisions which have given rise to these concerns are very recent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue was raised by the member for Tangney and I must address it in the short time available to me. I say it is incorrect to suggest that the issue of retrospectivity will deny a successful appellant or claimant before the AAT that to which it is entitled in terms of money. Where a claimant has succeeded before the AAT, it has a right to be paid. That has occurred in the definition of mining for minerals and in the sweeper claims. That is a judgment in favour of the applicant entitled to payment, and that has occurred following each AAT judgment. Again, there are other examples in that regard. So where a claimant has succeeded, that claim will be paid. I have explained in my second reading speech that these other prospective claims will no longer now be open to those particular claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech, I have summarised quite clearly the main features of the bill.

The new arrangements provide industry with much greater responsibility for its own affairs, moves it towards a less government regulated environment and with statutory structures that are appropriate to the future commercial and consumer challenges.

In addition to the 12 producers, processors and exporters nominated by the Cattle Council of Australia, Sheepmeats Council of Australia, Australian Meat Council, Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, have been added a representative of the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the Australian Livestock Exporters Association, the Australian Supermarket Institute Limited, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a government member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional organisations reflect their importance in the meat and livestock industry and they will no doubt add to the quality of the decision making by that body. Although the chairpersons of the AMLC and MRC will not be members of the MIC, as appropriate, they can be invited to attend council meetings. The composition of the MIC is quite large but this provides industry `ownership' and the confidence that their views are being represented in the important strategic planning and policy developments for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the MIC will be part time and appointed for up to three years at a time, although organisations may request replacement of one or more of their representatives at any time. There is no provision for deputies of members to ensure that continuity is given importance and that members and organisations take their responsibilities seriously. The legislation also provides for remuneration of members of the MIC&mdash;not to cover loss of income specifically, but to further encourage members' commitment to the council. Such remuneration will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the MIC to work effectively, there must be a clear acceptance by industry organisations and all members of council of their leadership role for the wider industry and not specific sectoral interests. It is also very important for representatives of council being able to make decisions for industry with authority. The government expects that the MIC will not be involved in the day-to-day program management of the corporations. Although the MIC will have a broad control over the AMLC and MRC budgets, it will not have a mandate to involve itself in program delivery, nor will it be involved in line-by-line examination of the corporations' budgets. The council will set the strategic directions against which programs will be developed, approve the strategic plans of the corporations and recommend appropriate levy rates to fund those plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC is tasked with working with the government and industry to develop the next steps to move to a non-statutory environment, developing directions for industry self-regulation and assisting the AMLC to develop timetables for the commercialisation of programs which will be best managed in a commercial environment. The MIC has an important role in the evaluation of industry programs managed by the corporations. Given the difficulties involved in quantifying the benefits of marketing and research activities, and in circumstances where there is little information available to levy payers and government to judge the performance of the AMLC and MRC, it will be an important role for the MIC to provide independent information to levy payers on the effectiveness of programs against predetermined performance criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such evaluation measures should be objective indicators which are monitored and reported on a regular basis. The MIC can also provide detailed case studies on the costs and benefits of specific programs of each organisation&mdash;or monitor the progress of the AMLC and MRC in fulfilling predetermined deadlines, such as the commercialisation of programs. Overall, an evaluation role will increase the transparency of the AMLC's and MRC's operations, as well as placing pressure on both organisations to continually improve performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC will be responsible for providing funding to the peak industry councils for consultations with the AMLC and MRC, unlike the present arrangement where the corporations provide such funding. It is appropriate that in determining the overall levels of funding, that industry also be responsible for determining consultation funding. However, the MIC and recipient bodies will be required to meet the government's guidelines concerning consultation funding and the recipient bodies will also be required to provide the minister with audited financial statements in relation to the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has been concerned for some time about the cost and substance of AGMs of the corporations. It is however necessary for the purposes of accountability to both the government and levy payers that AGMs continue. In the corporate world there is direct accountability to shareholders by private companies through an AGM process. As there will now be a staged move towards a non-statutory environment, it is important that such accountability mechanisms are not removed which would subsequently need to be reintroduced in a corporate environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, a new approach will take place at future AGMs. The MIC will be required to convene an annual industry conference, open to all registered levy and charge payers. However, it will be a `forward looking' process that will enable industry to consider the broad strategic directions for industry and provide a forum for discussion of important industry issues, unlike the current AGMs which by their very nature are retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AGMs will, however, be a smaller subset of the conference. The MIC will convene an industry annual general meeting of the three statutory bodies to formally present their annual reports, vote on any levy and charge motions put forward by the council, and vote on any no confidence motions put forward by levy and charge payers. This is necessary to provide accountability to the wider industry shareholders. All levy motions will be put forward by the MIC. Under the current arrangements the AMLC and MRC put forward their own motions to separate annual general meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a provision for the MIC to convene a special general meeting to consider a change in levy rates for the MIC, AMLC and MRC to meet special circumstances. This is not intended to be a regularly used power, but should be a safeguard to allow the industry to raise funds quickly to deal with an urgent industry management problem. The MIC will also be required to produce an annual report to parliament which must include the results of evaluations undertaken of AMLC and MRC programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the industry consultations there has been clear industry support for the thrust of the IC recommendations dealing with the commercialisation of some AMLC programs. Industry had in mind particularly the computer-assisted livestock marketing program, commonly referred to as CALM, and Aus-Meat programs, but there may be other programs which industry might determine can better operate in a commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation assists with the commercialisation of schemes such as the CALM program and Aus-Meat, a product description and quality assurance program under the strategic guidance of the MIC. The legislation allows AMLC, in cooperation with another organisation, to facilitate the marketing of goods other than meat and livestock. This will allow other species to participate in CALM to improve its commercial viability and allow AMLC to entice private equity into this program. However, eligible schemes will need to be prescribed, and details of the scope of their operations will need to be set out in the AMLC's corporate plan, which requires ministerial approval and the agreement of the MIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC's legislation will also be extended to cover by-products of the meat and livestock industry. This is a power which the MRC already has under its legislation. Given the need for industry to become more competitive, it is important that every opportunity be taken by industry to add value. In this regard, it will be up to the MIC to develop a strategy for adding value in the by-products and co-products areas, where there is considerable scope for further improvement. The legislation provides the MIC with the option, if it so chooses, of using the AMLC, as well as the MRC, as the program delivery mechanism under any agreed industry strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some functions and powers which are removed from the AMLC legislation and these include: the funding of industry bodies for consultation purposes, which will be transferred to the MIC, as mentioned earlier; the power to trade in meat and livestock; and the power to set conditions on the shipping of meat and livestock from Australia. Industry supports the removal of AMLC shipping and trading powers. These provisions are against the thrust of government's deregulatory reform, are not currently in use or likely to be used in the future. The MIC will examine the AMLC licensing powers and the implications for Aus-Meat and quota controls. In the interim, the AMLC will continue to administer export quota schemes where they become necessary on the basis determined by the MIC under the strategic planning process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC legislation is being amended to ensure that the MIC has a full range of options that it can consider when developing the policy framework for quota administration. The legislation includes provisions that will permit the allocation of quota free of charge or by auction, sale by tender or private sale. The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1995 gives effect to this provision. It is important that the MIC is not constrained in its analysis of options by legislation that predicates only one option&mdash;and that is, the status quo of allocation of quota free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Board membership for both the AMLC and MRC will be reduced from 11 to seven members to reflect their more sharply focused program management role. The boards will consist of: a chairperson, chosen and appointed by the minister; a managing director, chosen and appointed by the corporation; a government member, chosen and appointed by the minister; and four other members, appointed by the minister from candidates selected by a selection committee against a set of skills-based selection criteria. All members, apart from the managing director, will be part-time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The membership of the AMLC and MRC (except the chairs and managing directors) are to become vacant on the commencement of the amendments to the legislation. This is necessary administratively given the legislative requirement that qualifications and experience must collectively be achieved by the selection process. In addition, the legislative sunset provision prevents the phase-in of new board members appointed for a normal three-year period as the terms of current board members expire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although current board appointments will continue until 30 June 1995, I want to take this opportunity to thank the current board members for their work up to that period and place on record that this necessary action is no reflection on their performance. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the chair of the AMLC, John Kerin, and of the MRC, Robin Bligh, for their stewardship of the corporations at what has been an unsettling period for industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC board members will need to collectively possess qualifications and experience in the following fields of activity: livestock production; the processing and export of meat; business management; finance and industrial relations; the promotion of products; and the international marketing of products. MRC board members will need to possess qualifications and experience in the following fields of activity: livestock production; the processing and export of meat; business management and finance; administration of research and development; commercialisation of the results of research and development; and conservation and management of natural resources and environmental and ecological matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria for board selections for the corporations encompass qualifications and experience that are necessary for effective decision taking and effective delivery of MIC strategies. Effective delivery of MIC strategies also requires that AMLC and MRC board members possess an ability to understand strategic plans and how programs can be developed to achieve those plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opportunity has also been taken in the legislation to streamline selection committee arrangements. Whilst it is accepted that previous selection committees have done an excellent job with their selections, there is now no real need for a seven-person selection committee to represent industry, particularly since the strategic planning, policy development and industry funding decisions are to be taken by the Meat Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the success of future arrangements, it is very important that broad strategic planning and policy decisions are taken in the MIC and not in the corporation boards, and that the boards are skills based for their program delivery role. The selection committee is therefore reduced from seven members to four and moves away from the specific representative approach under current legislation. The new legislation provides for a four-person selection committee with an independent chair appointed by the minister and three members on the nomination of the MIC, which the minister would also appoint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A selection committee has been convened to begin the task of selecting members for the AMLC and MRC boards. Ms Julia King has been appointed as presiding member and she will be ably assisted in the selection process by three members nominated by the interim Meat Industry Council. It is appropriate that the selection process be undertaken on the basis which is to be followed under the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the legislation the government will take the opportunity to correct a previous legislative drafting error with respect to the cattle transaction levy (CTL), cattle export charge (CEC), and national residue survey (NRS) cattle acts which imposed a customs duty and an excise duty in the same acts. These acts will need to be amended and the levies and charges reimposed retrospectively. However, payments made under the old acts will satisfy any retrospective obligations imposed by the new acts. The Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1995, Cattle Export Charges Amendment Bill 1995, National Residue Survey (Cattle Export) Levy Bill 1995, National Residue Survey Administration Amendment Bill 1995, National Residue Survey (Cattle Transactions) Levy Bill 1995 and Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1995 give effect to this amendment.

I just wonder how many people in this room and out and beyond realise&mdash;probably you do, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;what an absolute farce we are witnessing in this chamber in many real ways right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us is a wholly inadequate response to major recommendations made 14 or 15 months ago about the competitiveness of Australia's major agricultural export industry, in a report which said that major and sweeping reforms were needed&mdash;a report which has been largely shoved under the carpet. I will come later to some of the claims in the set speech made a few moments ago by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). Here we are debating that report, at a time when the industry is in very serious competitive difficulties, in the second chamber of this House and at a time when the responsible minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), is not even in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we hear all of this talk around the place about vision statements for Australia and about how we are going to take up our place in Asia and how we are matching world best practice and all the rest of it, in this chamber we are seeing the reality of the government's refusal to tackle the hard issues that are of critical importance if we are to take our place in global trading terms and, I believe, in terms of our economic and social freedom in the longer term. I do not use those terms lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to illustrate this in a way which will undoubtedly make the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) utter some remark about how I have said it all before. But in the sense that she belongs to a team that has not addressed any of these issues, I indicate to her that I am going to continue to use this example until some effective reforms are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would recall that towards the end of last year a well-known Australian restaurant chain went to import 12 or 13 container loads of American rump. The chain claimed that that had to do with the drought, but under public pressure it backed off and said, `No, we will continue sourcing the product in Australia,' so obviously the product supply was not the problem that it had initially made out. That particular chain buys on price, amongst other things, and I do not in any way criticise it for that. It has a long record of doing so and sees no reason why it should change now, and there is no reason why I would suggest that it should change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we went and had a look at the question of price. We found that people who wanted to import beef from America could go to that country, where they would pay a great deal more for the raw product than they would in Australia. The American producer, in other words, gets a better return than the Australian producer. Those purchasers would put the beef through an American packing house, or an abattoir, in our language, and pack it into boxes, into containers; they would truck it to the seaboard and across an American wharf; then they would ship it across the Pacific and unload it across our wharves&mdash;so well reformed by the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy when he was the minister responsible for waterfront reform that they only cost two or three times as much now as wharves across the Tasman&mdash;and past our DPIE arrangements, protocols and what have you; and that American steak could be distributed in this country for around $5.80 a kilo. The best one can source the Australian product for is around $6.20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bowled a question up to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It bears repeating. I am bored with telling the story but I am going to keep telling it. I asked, `Prime Minister, how is this so? Does it not indicate that your charges and your taxes on the meat industry and your industrial relations approaches are making us non-competitive? If we cannot compete here at home on our own domestic markets as the world's major exporter of beef, how are we ever going to make it in Asia if this is indicative of the lack of real reform in this country?' The Prime Minister, as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will confirm, in effect said to me, `Well, aren't you a mug for highlighting the inefficiency of the Australian beef producer?' That is what he said. The mob opposite ought to be absolutely ashamed of that response and the Prime Minister ought to take a little more notice of his own people, the people who in this country advise the government on industry progress, on industry's needs for reform, on how our industries need to be updated to be internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been better if the Prime Minister actually had sought to be honest and had displayed a little more integrity in this process. I must say that I am very sad that a lot of the commentators that day refused to pick it up, as well. I pursued it with quite a few people in the media. I said, `Look, this is about the drought, it is about industrial relations, it is about trade, it is about agriculture, our place in Asia, taxes, charges&mdash;the whole gamut.' It really is indicative of what is wrong right across the board, why we believe that radical change is necessary in this country in terms of our cultural attitudes, in terms of the way we work together, in terms of the way we stop short-term expediency in taxation formation at the expense all the time of long-term gain for the Australian community. Yet none of the media covered it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, here it is, the Industry Commission report, the government's own, which came out in April last year&mdash;very comprehensive; this is only a fraction of it. It is the latest in quite a long line&mdash;I have got some more here and I will refer to that in a moment&mdash;which condemn the lack of efficiency and reform in the Australian meat industry and first of all gives the lie to the Prime Minister's claims and the nonsense we will hear later from one or two opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>Now listen to this, from the introduction to the overview. The second paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With abundant grazing land and a favourable climate, Australia produces livestock at very low cost by international standards. However, efficient processing is necessary if we are to take full advantage of our comparative advantage in livestock production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australian meat is generally price competitive on export markets&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I wish the Prime Minister was listening&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this is largely because processors are able to buy livestock at very low prices compared with processors of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This inquiry has found that despite some recent improvements, Australia's meat processing industry operates at significantly higher cost than processing industries of most countries with which it competes. It has also found that Australian meat exports have been losing market share in almost all of our major export markets.</PARA>
<PARA>So let us put furphy No. 1 to rest. The Australian producer is not inefficient. He is amongst the world's most efficient, if not the most efficient, particularly in terms of manpower. There can be no suggestion that that is not so, when he is able to survive&mdash;and that is all he is doing at the moment&mdash;on returns some 50 or 60 per cent less than his American counterpart gets, and continues to produce and continues to undergird Australia as the most significant exporter of beef globally at the moment. He cannot possibly be inefficient. He has had to be efficient to survive. The people who represent beef industries, cattlemen, ought to go out there and explain to their people that the Prime Minister does not know what he is talking about. His gratuitously insulting remarks about the efficiency of the Australian beef producer ought to be exposed for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to continue to read some of this in. I mean, this is the government's report, this is what government members are responding to&mdash;with the minister not even in the country, in the second chamber in the House&mdash;15 months after the government's own report indicates major change is necessary. The third heading is `Towards a new productive culture' and the report goes on to say, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But change has been painfully slow. To seize the opportunities now being presented, the industry must significantly accelerate the changes taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour is by far the largest single input cost of processing livestock into meat. The industry has been disadvantaged by a poor industrial relations climate and a poor occupational health and safety record. Features of the industry's awards system inhibit innovation and have contributed to industrial unrest. Seniority systems and daily hire provide insufficient incentives for training and skills development. The complexity of the tally system, and its structure of premium rates of remuneration for extra output, reduces incentive for improving working conditions and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capacity utilisation of the Australian industry is lower than that of our competitors, resulting in higher fixed costs per unit of output. Where seasonality dominates production&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is a problem in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and livestock must travel long distances to slaughter, low levels of capital utilisation in some regions may be, to some extent, beyond our control.</PARA>
<PARA>Now the Meat Research Corporation acknowledges that point as well, but goes on to make out that it can only account for a percentage of our relative cost disadvantage in this country. The IC report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But poor capital utilisation is also directly attributable to inflexibilities associated with industrial awards&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we heard this nonsense, so I will get on to this in a minute, about how much reform has taken place in recent times, and we have got some very interesting stuff for the people opposite&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">particularly penalty rates which rise with increased hours of operation and multiple shifts. The Commission has found that greater flexibility&mdash;particularly greater use of enterprise agreements&mdash;could bring about significant productivity gains . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the rub, here is the bit that gets under my skin so much from people opposite who say that we are about driving down conditions, award arrangements and so forth for workers. Their future is dependent on reform in this industry, and the IC says it. The next words are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with benefits for workers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>they put them first&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">producers, processors, and some consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>It is about time some of the people in this place who purport to represent the interests of workers realise that some genuine reform is the only way their jobs, and the jobs of their kids, in so much of rural Australia are still going to be there in the future. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence available to the Commission indicates that there are gains to be realised from reform. While the magnitude of the estimated gains varies between studies, reductions in processing costs of at least 8 to 10 per cent are achievable though they could be significantly higher.</PARA>
<PARA>An extra eight to 10 per cent is pretty minor stuff compared to what all the other reports say is available. Those gains would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Queensland economy and to the Queensland beef industry&mdash;let alone to everywhere else in the country. Some of that money could be usefully directed to the workers in the industry who, in my opinion, are underpaid for doing a very tough job. I would be the first to say that they are entitled to a fairer go, but they will not get it until they are allowed freely to enter into arrangements&mdash;and I use that word advisedly&mdash;which will benefit all. That will require better performance from employers as well as from employees, but particularly it will mean some major changes in attitudes and behavioural patterns on the part of our trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer also to the Meat Research Corporation report. That is the really interesting one. That report established, in a comparison of Australia, America and Argentina, that we were far and away the most inefficient. So, perhaps being generous, it thought it should see whether it could find somebody else that Australia could outdo. So it had a look at Ireland and New Zealand as well and guess what? Instead of being at the bottom of a pile of three we came at the bottom of a pile of five. Nothing has changed since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report indicated that the labour component in the processing of beef in America is as low as 13 1/2c per kilo, that in New Zealand it is about 25c&mdash;remember that only a few years ago it was at our sorts of levels&mdash;and that the Argentineans are about to manage that sort of performance as well. In Australia as recently as a couple of years ago our best practice was obstinately stuck at the high 40c level&mdash;three times the American level. That is hardly a Third World country level, hardly a country where slave labour rates are paid, despite what the members opposite are saying. We saw that furphy well and truly closed off yesterday in the House. The reality is that we have failed to develop our efficiencies and our productive capabilities, and we have failed to develop a sense of mutuality and commonsense in the development of a way forward for the industry so that we are woefully off the pace. Not only the future of producers is at risk but also the future of workers in the industry, as the Industry Commission report itself said. Booz Allen made the point that New Zealand has demonstrated conclusively that change is possible. It went on to say that these issues must be addressed, that a great deal more needs to be done, and that the price of continuing failure to reform will be very high indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of other points that are highly relevant. Again, the government has taken 14 or 15 slovenly months to respond to these issues&mdash;something should have been put in place 10 years ago&mdash;but finally the government has got around to a response. The world has moved on while precious little has happened in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not long ago that we were worried about the enormous pile of frozen beef in Europe and we were concerned that that might be used to flood our markets. We were all very relieved when the GATT signatories arrived and it was presumed that we need not worry about the breaking of the Andriessen agreement under which the Europeans would not move their beef product in store onto our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we still have a major problem with the beef stockpile which this time is going to affect us. While we have sat on our hands and done nothing, the European stockpile has largely disappeared but there is another one: 600,000 tonnes of beef surplus to requirements are sloshing around in the US looking for a home. We could condemn the Americans for their ridiculous subsidy packages which have resulted in that surplus but we at home might have been doing something to ensure that we would be able to compete with that beef, given the pressures it is going to put on our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is made worse: Uruguay has recently completed its OIE obligations. I cannot pronounce the words that OIE stands for but basically it is the World Trade Organisation's exotic diseases headquarters. Uruguay has just completed the requirements there so it will now be allowed to ship fresh meats to the US from 1 July this year. From the year's end, on a zonal basis Argentina will also be free to ship meat into the USA, traditionally our most important market and one we have virtually lost now. What is it going to mean? Will it mean ever more products sloshing around on world markets at a time when we are less able than ever to compete fully?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come next to the actual bill. I want to say a few things specifically about it as far as it goes. Broadly, we will support the Meat Industry Council although, to be honest, I have some real reservations even about it. I will support it because the industry said it wants it and because the alternatives that were put before the industry were even less attractive. But I want to make some points about it. There are 23 IC recommendations. I will not read them all in; if I had time, I would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 23 recommendations to the government in this: three deal directly with industrial relations reforms; seven deal with the AMLC; seven deal with actions which the government should undertake in relation to market access and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; one deals with local government; one concerns licensing; one is about R&amp;D; one recommends the restructuring of the policy council&mdash;this legislation; and one suggests the policy council investigate the scope of the AMLC to fund individual projects by way of direct charges to beneficiaries and concomitant reductions in general levies. In relation to the recommendation on a restructured policy council, the Industry Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considers that the AMLIPC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the policy council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should be restructured, that its membership should more directly reflect the views of levy payers and major stakeholders such as employees, with government and quasi-public bodies currently represented, such as AQIS, AMLC and MRC, as non-voting members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restructured in such a way, the AMLIPC would be able to play a valuable role in setting major policy priorities for the industry on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA>That would be fine if it were really free to enact them. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations made by the Commission on the scope for project financing in the AMLC and the possible introduction of multiple export inspection standards should be considered by the AMLIPC, as could issues such as the benefits of an industry-wide system for grading of Australian meat sold in domestic and international markets. A restructured AMLIPC could also be responsible for undertaking external evaluation of the effectiveness of AMLC and MRC programs.</PARA>
<PARA>So this legislation will supposedly establish new arrangements which are intended to give industry a greater role and more responsibility in deciding its own affairs, and move it to a less regulated environment. Broadly speaking, I have no objection to that. The problem is, of course, that it is not going to be able to do it in terms of the existing regimes, the existing obstacles to reform and the existing cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill, the main bill in the package, establishes a new council&mdash;the Meat Industry Council&mdash;to replace the old policy council. It redefines the role of the AMLC and the MRC. The new council will be responsible for developing strategic industry policy which will then provide the framework under which the AMLC and the MRC will develop their corporate and operations plans. The bill is transitional. It is to start on 1 July this year and will sunset on 30 June 1998. At that stage it is intended that the three statutory industry authorities will revert to a non-statutory status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how that is going to work. What do we do if we have to impose, say, export restrictions or quotas or whatever on countries which will only take limited amounts of our product? We do not assume we are going to be in a totally free-trading world environment by then. I do not know how we are going to do it without a statutory authority. However, there is the capacity to review this after a couple of years. I can assure members that if there is a change of government it will be reviewed long before then. The government says it will also enable the industry to identify its problems and to devise commercial responses to them. As I have said before, in terms of the government's legislative roadblocks to that sort of process, in my view it just is not going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC will also be responsible for funding of the AMLC and the MRC through the power to recommend levy rates to industry annual general meetings. This will ensure that programs of the AMLC and the MRC conform with the industry's strategic direction laid down by the MIC. The MIC will be accountable to the minister and to parliament and will have to produce a corporate plan and an annual report each year, projecting three years ahead. The corporations will only be accountable to the MIC. The MIC is to be a body corporate as it will be holding money on its own account and will have the ability to employ staff and consultants. It must hold an annual conference and organise annual general meetings of each statutory body during the conference. And at conference there will be discussion of broad industry concerns, but no motions of a general industry nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be 18 members of the MIC, comprising a chairman, a government member, both of whom will be appointed by the minister who will also appoint other members on the recommendation of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Council, the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Livestock Exporters Association, the Australian Lot Feeders Association, the Australian Supermarket Institute Ltd, and other members prescribed by regulation. Before appointment of a chairman, the minister must consult the above bodies, and a person employed by any of these bodies is not eligible for appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on with the rest of the detail; that has been adequately outlined, in terms of the legislative changes anyway, by the minister who presented this stuff to us a little while ago. I want to revert to the real issues for the future of the meat industry which are things such as: government reform of its statutory authorities&mdash;including AQIS; costs and charges; and industrial relations. Let us start by debunking one interesting little claim made by the minister when he said&mdash;and he was just echoing something that Minister Collins said in Queensland a little while ago&mdash;that, `Golly, gee whiz, we have 34 enterprise agreements up and going.' One industry leader has told me in no uncertain terms that 16 of them constitute nothing more than an agreement by unions to talk in return for a wage increase. That is pretty indicative of what we seem to be talking about when the government comes to tell us about its improved industrial relations approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister went on to say that the current legislation provided good guidelines and good capacity for industrial relations reform. He said it could all happen under the government's package. That is an interesting claim. But it just happens that I have come across a review of progress in workplace reform in the export meat processing sector that was put together for none other than the department itself. It says some pretty interesting things. It was commissioned by the federal Department of Industrial Relations to review the progress of, and impediments to, workplace reform in the export meat processing sector. It is based on a series of interviews with chief executives of major companies in the industry, representatives of the ACTU, the industry's principal union, and representatives of other organisations with an interest in, or involvement with, the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, they said some interesting things. For example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress has generally been limited, with little to show in terms of widespread and quantifiable increases in productivity and efficiency. Where progress has been evident, enterprise bargaining has been a component of a broader program to improve culture and relationships across the companies' operations.</PARA>
<PARA>But then the report goes on to say, in reference to the general nature of enterprise bargains:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enterprise bargains achieved to date have not been particularly innovative or successful in encouraging improvements at the plant level.</PARA>
<PARA>Can you believe it? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many cases, they have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are&mdash;with a critically important industry to this country's export performance. It may have escaped those opposite that we have a trade crisis in this country. We are a long way behind. When major reform is necessary and when we are facing massive and increasing competition abroad, what does this report say? It says that such modest reforms as the minister is able to refer to are virtually valueless. That is what this says. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Virtually without exception, all parties have been critical of the lack of progress in addressing issues through the AIRC processes. Many companies now have little confidence in the system and believe that if a change is to be successful, then it will only be possible through action at the company level. While the parties have agreed to participate, there is little expectation at this stage that the newly formed Industry Consultative Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>by which I take it they mean the MIC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will achieve any concrete outcomes. It would be unfortunate, however, if the ICC was not supported, as it could be a useful forum to address industry-wide issues if the appropriate attitudes existed among the parties.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would need to be quite dramatic changes in approach to convince many of the key players to participate constructively in any industry level initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not going to drive it, is it? It is just a cop-out, designed to put another buffer zone between the ministry and the government on the one hand, and industry and their needs for reform on the other&mdash;reform in the interests not just of the industry but of the workers who depend upon it for their jobs now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read into the record just a couple of other things out of this report. It identifies a number of impediments to workplace reform and I want to cover just two of them that relate to employers and unions&mdash;firstly, employers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With some exceptions the industry's individual employers generally display a traditional and narrow approach to relations with their employees and unions and fail to acknowledge change where it has occurred. The concept of best practice is not well understood by the industry's employers, who have generally looked for excuses rather than accept that the initiative for reform must lie with management.</PARA>
<PARA>Fair cop, they have got to wear that criticism. It is all about industrial relations. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The union has adopted a narrow view of enterprise bargaining and has been reluctant to allow direct discussions between management and employees. There is a significant gap between the positive views expressed by national officials and the approach of officials at plant level. The union has not been active in educating the work force to the benefits of change and lacks capacity, resources and commitment to reform throughout its organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that, in this country, until those who are responsible frame suitable legislation and practices that govern how we work and determine whether or not we will be forced to communicate with one another sensibly in our workplaces&mdash;where necessary, on a workplace by workplace basis&mdash;we will go nowhere. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion&mdash;I have not got longer; I could go on for hours if I were able to&mdash;I want to make a couple of points.
