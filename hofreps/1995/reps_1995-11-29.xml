<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill establishes a joint food standards system in Australia and New Zealand. It is the culmination of two years careful and considered negotiation. It sets the pace for reform in this increasingly important sector of the economy. The new food standard system will promote trade in the food industry in both countries. It will also reduce costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand is now Australia's third largest trading partner. Trans-Tasman bilateral trade in food has passed the billion dollar mark. To maintain this growth, the government is looking to go beyond the closer economic relations arrangements. It is looking to remove trade barriers by establishing a single market in food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, food is regulated by a cooperative commonwealth, state and territory arrangement set in place in 1991. This provides for standards to be developed by the National Food Authority, a commonwealth agency. This is a process that works well. It is characterised by open and transparent consultative arrangements. It enables all groups and interests to participate to ensure Australian food standards protect public health and safety and facilitate trade in a purposeful and lasting way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority recommends standards for adoption to a Council of Health Ministers which is known as the National Food Standards Council. If food standards are adopted by the council, they are then taken up by reference and without amendment into the food laws of the states and territories. This system is somewhat unique in its ability to respond quickly and effectively to the health and safety needs of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the food standard system is transparent and accountable. Public consultation, widespread public notification and parliamentary estimates processes all ensure that the food standards system is open to scrutiny and public input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand government has recognised the success of the existing Australian food standards system. Consequently, negotiations between the two countries have resulted in a proposed joint food standards setting system, based upon the existing Australian model, to deliver joint standards in the two countries. It is an innovative and exciting outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A treaty has been negotiated. New Zealand will join the Australian system with as little disruption as possible. The obligations arising from the 1991 agreement between the states and territories will be preserved. We will recognise the needs of New Zealand as a sovereign nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional arrangements in the treaty address bilateral trade issues. They provide the means for the Australian food industry to secure access to the New Zealand market. The arrangements have been carefully negotiated. The Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public health and safety will remain the paramount consideration for food standards. The provision of information to consumers, the promotion of fair trade and trade and commerce in the food industry will also be taken into account. International standards will be considered where they are consistent with the other objectives. Consumers can be confident that the protection afforded by our food standards to the Australian community and our industry will not be lowered. Standards will continue to meet Australian needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia enjoys an international reputation for its food standards and its food standards setting system. We have been able to capture a sizeable market share on our reputation for providing high quality foods. The new food standards system supports this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All existing quarantine, hygiene and food inspection laws will continue to apply. Third countries will not be able to circumvent the rigorous systems currently in place. We will maintain our market edge as a `clean and green' food producer. Australia's international reputation in this area will be enhanced by the treaty. Our position in the region as a trading partner with New Zealand will be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for the establishment of a joint standards agency, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Authority. It will have offices and operations in both Australia and New Zealand. Standards developed by the new authority will be recommended to a joint council of health ministers, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. It will comprise ministers from the Commonwealth, New Zealand, the states and the territories. If food standards are adopted by the council, they will be published in both countries and be adopted by reference and without amendment into food legislation in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, this will occur through the already established mechanisms of the 1991 Commonwealth, state and territory agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The food standards system allows New Zealand to opt-out of a joint standard in exceptional circumstances. New Zealand, as a sovereign nation, has a right to determine its own domestic laws. However, the opt-out provisions are strict and have tightly defined criteria. It is expected that they will be used only in very rare circumstances, if at all. The New Zealand member of the ministerial council will be required to provide a statement of reasons setting out the exceptional circumstances that cause New Zealand to vary from the joint standard. There is also a mechanism to review any decision to opt-out. This matter will be kept under very close and careful scrutiny. Both Australia and New Zealand recognise that the more the opt-out provision is used the less effective the joint food standards system will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decisions of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council will be subject to the regulation impact assessments required by principles endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments. The joint system also provides for the proposed trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement to apply to food so that the trade impact of non-uniform standards is minimised. New Zealand will bear the costs of its participation in the Australia New Zealand food standards system, so this bill is cost neutral to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, after almost two years of negotiations, the Australia New Zealand food standards system represents an excellent result for Australia and the Australian food industry. It should remove a number of trade access issues which have been frustrating Australian exporters. It will reduce compliance costs and provide for a larger and more secure market in processed foods. The system will ensure that closer economic relations with New Zealand remain at the cutting edge of trade policy. It provides a worthy example for similar processes of trade facilitation in the APEC region and in the wider multilateral context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the opposition for its cooperation and support for this very important bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the National Food Authority Amendment Bill. It provides some of the enabling machinery to implement a food standards harmonisation treaty with New Zealand, which will be a most welcome step in the development of freer trans-Tasman trade. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) has pointed out, the trans-Tasman trade in food products is above the $1,000 million mark and of great value, therefore, to the Australian economy and to Australian jobs. I believe too that the treaty is a positive step on the road to greater international harmonisation of product standards generally in the Asia-Pacific region and blends well into the opportunities offered by the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in the post-GATT era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Harmonisation Treaty is the culmination of several years work by dedicated people on both sides of the Tasman. I am sure the parliamentary secretary will not mind if I single out the Acting Chairman of the National Food Authority, Terry Slater, for his behind the scenes role in bringing about this result. I should also compliment the parliamentary secretary on his work. I had dinner with the food industry group last night and they were very complimentary about him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand is not the easiest country to negotiate with at the best of times and this treaty is a good result for both countries. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement. From the Australian side it will ensure that our food products have access to a wider Australasian market. Similarly, as joint standards are adopted, New Zealand will have greater market access for its food products and it will also benefit from participating in Australia's efficient food standards system centred around the National Food Authority, which through this bill will become the Australia New Zealand Food Authority under the ministerial oversight of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with all sensible international agreements, there has been give and take on both sides. New Zealand has given up a measure of sovereignty by agreeing to this treaty as it will be participating on an equal vote basis in the standards setting process with the Commonwealth and the Australian states and territories. In many cases, it will also be moving to adjust its foods standards upwards to come into harmony with prevailing Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On our side, we are easing the access of New Zealand producers and manufacturers in a way not yet achieved under closer economic relations. In other words, we have here a workable arrangement. I note that it has broad support from the states and territories, who are joining with the Commonwealth in this instance to welcome New Zealand into the fold. The coalition is also satisfied that the agreement is welcome on the New Zealand side and notes the New Zealand cabinet's keenness to finalise the treaty in Wellington on 5 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In announcing the coalition's support for this agreement, I want to say we have sought assurances from the government that the interests of Australian industry will not be affected detrimentally by the Australian and New Zealand food standard arrangements, whether in the transition phase over the next two to three years or the subsequent final implementation of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code; that the high quality of food products rightfully expected by Australian consumers will continue to be safeguarded; that inferior standard exports will not enter Australia by being re-exported through New Zealand; that the opt-out arrangements in the agreement for New Zealand will operate only as a last resort and only with clear and transparent reasons; and that nothing in the agreement will affect the Commonwealth, states and territories from discharging their lawful responsibilities under public health and quarantine laws. On behalf of the coalition, I appreciate the government's willingness to give these assurances and to put them on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority Amendment Bill 1995, which is before us, is essentially enabling legislation making amendments to the National Food Authority Act to accommodate the incorporation of New Zealand into the transformed National Food Authority and the similarly transformed Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council as a full and equal member&mdash;and, I note, a full paying member. The one provision of the bill which has generated real concern is the proposed amendment to clause 13, which amends paragraph 10(e) of the principal act. That paragraph reads at present:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards where they are at variance, providing that it does not lower the Australian standard.</PARA>
<PARA>The words which stand to be omitted are those relating to the end of the clause: `providing that it does not lower the Australian standard'. Honourable members may recall that when the National Food Authority Act passed through this parliament in 1991 it was the coalition and the Democrats that insisted on the inclusion of paragraph 10(e) in that act. Therefore, the proposal to omit that proviso is not something we have done lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering this clause, the coalition gave some hard thought to the central issue involved: are we, by entering into this agreement with New Zealand, going to allow an arrangement which compromises existing high Australian standards on food? In considering this, the coalition consulted widely&mdash;and we are sensitive to concerns of the consumer sector on the issue&mdash;but on balance I have to say that the feeling is that what we believed was necessary in 1991 is no longer imperative in 1995, and I give the following reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, since 1991 there have been major, even spectacular, strides in the world trading environment. GATT has been replaced by the World Trade Organisation, APEC has come into its own as a major trading bloc in our Asia-Pacific region, and the other markets, such as the European Union, are moving rapidly towards the harmonisation of goods and services standards amongst their member states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it appears that to retain the Australia specific proviso in this paragraph may technically be in contravention of Australia's obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation network and we would send the wrong message, however small, to our trading partners and the wider economic community. Even amending the paragraph to refer to Australia-New Zealand standards appears to contravene the intent of the WTO agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, New Zealand has made it clear to the Australian government, and also to the coalition, that it regards this as an indicator of Australia's willingness to open itself up to joint standards with them and argues that it does not believe this will be at the cost of high standards of product, quality and safety. If Australia, with one vote for every state, territory and the Commonwealth, and New Zealand, with one vote only, cannot get something that is acceptable to Australia, then I think we have a major problem. Further, I also think it is important that with New Zealand, our special neighbour and friend, a bit of goodwill does not occasionally go astray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is another more practical explanation; that is, the operation of section 10 of the National Food Authority Act has been such that no-one has ever relied on paragraph 10(e) and its proviso to make a decision about setting or varying Australian food standards. Put simply, the five paragraphs of section 10 of the act offer a hierarchy of priorities to which the soon to be Australia New Zealand Food Authority must have regard in considering food standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rightly, the protection of public health and safety is at the top of that list and it would be a very sad day if the standards of food that we consumed failed to ensure that, first and foremost, it is safe. Then, in descending order in section 10 we have: adequate product information to aid consumer choice and to prevent fraud and deception; the promotion of fair trading in food; and the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry. Then, and only then, does paragraph 10(e) come into play and, as I am advised, in practice it has never had to be relied on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making these observations I would also argue that the construction of the preconditions in section 10 of the act, if applied to the variants of the international standards test of paragraph 10(e), as it will remain after the passage of this legislation, should almost certainly ensure that 10(e), if ever relied upon, will be applied in a way that it puts the interests of Australia and now New Zealand consumers first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we note the reservations in some sectors about deleting the proviso in 10(e), the coalition believes on balance that it is safe to move on without jeopardising the health and safety of the Australian community and their right to expect safe and quality food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is aware that there is some concern in another place about the provisions of this bill in relation to paragraph 10(e) of the National Food Authority Act. We have heard those concerns and are happy to have discussions with other parties about them. I say on the record on behalf of the coalition that at the end of the day this bill will pass. If the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Harmonisation Treaty is not signed next month&mdash;which will be a very great pity&mdash;by the present government with coalition support, it will be signed next year by a coalition government with Labor support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage of the parliamentary session and with the legislative program in the other place in something of a mess, it would be very easy for us to play politics with this bill; to hold it up to deprive a probably outgoing government of something that it wants. But to do that would not be in the national interest, and it would therefore be very disappointing if the bill were held up. This is especially so because we believe it contains strong and sufficient safeguards in the transitional and full implementation phase to protect our national interest and the interests of individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, just as importantly, this treaty offers Australia very real opportunities for an expanded market. It offers our producers great opportunities, and it would be a tragedy to lose them. For these reasons, we support its quick passage through both houses of parliament. We will not put any obstacles in its way. The coalition therefore wishes every success to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Harmonisation Treaty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As previous speakers have mentioned, the National Food Authority Amendment Bill 1995 transforms the National Food Authority into the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It will lead to the development of common Australian and New Zealand food standards. It provides for New Zealand representation on the board, and it also gives New Zealand representation on the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. The legislation is required to give support to a treaty which I understand is scheduled to be signed in Wellington next week. The legislation is certainly an advance in harmonisation and the development of the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that for once the government is coming to the parliament with the legislation before it signs the treaty. Far too often this parliament is delivered with a fait accompli. We are told that an international convention or a bilateral agreement has been signed somewhere around the world and, therefore, the parliament must pass certain legislation to meet the obligations of that treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) for taking the initiative in coming to the parliament first before the treaty is signed. That treats the parliament with the respect that it deserves. It also gets the priorities right. We have sovereignty over affairs in our own nation and have responsibility for those decisions which need to be made in this country. I understand that the legislation will not be going through the New Zealand parliament before the treaty is signed, but that is a matter for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of a bilateral treaty certainly is significant in relation to food standards. I suspect that, the way in which the High Court has been interpreting the use of the Commonwealth's foreign affairs power, this treaty somehow alters the balance of power even within the National Food Authority and extends the Commonwealth's influence, because it will have the backing of an international agreement to support its involvement in food standards and food policy issues. In this instance, the states are willing participants in the National Food Authority. They have become involved in this common setting of national standards and, as a result, it has to be assumed that they are satisfied with the Commonwealth's participation and its leading role in ensuring that our own country has common standards state by state. There has been universal acceptance of the merits of that kind of harmony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that with the passage of time there will also be universal acceptance of the benefits of harmonising Australian and New Zealand standards not just for food but also for a whole range of policy areas. Australia and New Zealand are the closest of friends. We have been very good neighbours. It is true that we might like to fight a bit at cricket, football and the like, but fundamentally there is no country in the world with which Australia enjoys a closer association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement certainly brings a new closeness because, essentially, we will be accepting joint sovereignty over food standards in each country by having this common set of arrangements. That is indeed a very significant step that can only happen when there is a strong degree of trust and goodwill between countries to underlie that relationship, and I hope that this can be built upon as the years go by.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, New Zealand is our third largest trading partner. The trans-Tasman food trade is now worth more than $1 billion a year, so it is dealing with a very significant element of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the CER agreement was signed in Canberra on 28 March 1983 to develop a framework of closer trade links, the arrangements have worked reasonably well. Of course, there has been the odd administrative difficulty, and that is to be expected. There have been problems in some industries, and there will no doubt also be some problems associated with this new agreement that is to be signed next week. But we are certainly better off with the restructuring that has occurred, and the overall benefits have far outweighed the disadvantages that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that our international trade links and our working relationship with New Zealand could be even better if we restructured shipping arrangements and if there was greater effort made towards developing better standards of business regulation and the like between our two countries. The overarching of the World Trade Organisation and the moves towards common standards in APEC, of course, also provide a very important background for this particular agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other night I was listening to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the MTIA dinner, droning on and telling us how industry had never had it so good and that these were the golden years for our country. Most people were dozing off, but he did make some very important points about Australia's opportunities in Asia, about the fact that Australia has tremendous opportunities to trade more extensively with those countries and to build up relationships in that area. This closer relationship with New Zealand is an important element of that process and, I think, as we move towards harmonising international standards and those in APEC, none of those sorts of things would really be regarded as attainable objectives if we could not reach agreement with a friendly country, our closest neighbour, New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, consumers and industry groups in Australia are keen to ensure that this new agreement does not in any way compromise Australia's standards. We in Australia have high food standards; we are rightly proud of those, and we want to maintain them. I think the fact that New Zealand acknowledges that we have an effective standards regime has undoubtedly been an element in this agreement being reached. It will be a sort of two-way deal involving a great deal of reciprocation in trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is an important element in promoting freer trade, and also in the development of a single Australia-New Zealand market. Both countries benefit from that sort of an objective, but in a sense I guess there is more benefit for New Zealand. New Zealand gains freer access to a market six times the size of its existing market, where Australian industry gains freer access to a market about one-sixth the size of our existing markets. So New Zealand firms have the potential to gain significantly from these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think New Zealand also stands to gain because of the very competitive business environment which currently exists there. Already many Australian companies have been attracted to establish some of their food operations and, indeed, other manufacturing activities in New Zealand. They are relocating there because of the more attractive business environment that is offered in that country at the present time, and that of course concerns Australian unions and Australian workers because jobs have been lost in this country. That is not a reason for us to oppose CER, it is not a reason for us to oppose this legislation, but it is a clear message that Australia has to do much better in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must improve our industrial relations environment. We must get rid of uncompetitive tax measures. We have to get rid of excessive business regulations. We have to get rid of high cost structures. Over recent years New Zealand has been doing better than us in these areas and so they have been attracting Australian industry. This legislation freeing up the trade in food between our countries has the potential to speed up that transfer of industry from Australia to New Zealand. So there is a clear message to Australia that we must do better to be competitive with New Zealand in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having declared my support for the objectives of this legislation and in support of the shadow minister for health, who has demonstrated the coalition's commitment to this process, I want to express some concerns about some aspects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the legislation is being rushed through parliament so quickly. It was introduced only last Thursday and has to be through both Houses by Friday. It is being treated as non-controversial legislation, as I understand it, in the Senate but it is, of course, not without controversy and there are threats of some amendments in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) is keen to get to Wellington next week before the calling of the federal election so he can have his perhaps one opportunity on the international stage. We would not want to any way spoil the party. But it would have been better if there had been a little more time to consult with some of the organisations concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumer groups have expressed concern about a number of aspects. They are worried about the fact that there are just two New Zealand representatives on the authority which may dilute the consumer's voice in the management of the National Food Authority. The fact that the representatives are effectively appointed by two governments means that if government and industry have a representative from New Zealand, then there is a risk that the consumer's voice may be somewhat reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are concerned that the harmonisation process could lead to lower Australian standards in some areas. I know that we will reach those standards by mutual agreement, but sometimes there will be greater pressure to reach the lowest common denominator when additional parties are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also concerned that, amongst the nine food code objectives outlined in the treaty to be signed, quality is not really listed as a stated objective. I appreciate that quality issues are referred to indirectly in some of the code objectives, but quality is not really specifically mentioned. They believe that it is an area that deserves some degree of priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also some concern about the opt-out provisions where New Zealand can, if it feels so inclined, opt out of particular standards. I recognise that sovereignty issues are involved and that there are significant constraints on the way in which that opt-out clause can be used. If indeed the opt-out clause is used excessively the agreement would really cease to have any useful function and Australia would need then to consider whether we wanted to any longer be a party to it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other matters, which perhaps are of more substance, that are of concern and they relate especially to the transitional provisions. During the transitional period dual standards will apply in New Zealand. Food from both countries can be sold and produced in that country either in accordance with the New Zealand food regulations or the Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern then is about Australia. Obviously Australian manufactured food has to meet Australian standards. Referring to the transitional arrangements, the parliamentary secretary said, quite unequivocally, that the Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged by them. But when I look at the actual treaty to be signed, annexe D, clause 3(b) actually says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Food produced in or imported from New Zealand which complies with the food standards included in the New Zealand food regulations which fall within the scope of this agreement can be sold in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that food which does not meet the Australian standards but which does meet the New Zealand standards will be able to be sold in this country during the transitional arrangements. I note the parliamentary secretary is taking some notes. I would appreciate any comments he might make on that transitional period. Can New Zealand foods be sold in this country that do not meet the Australian standards, so long as they just meet the New Zealand standards? There are not in a wide range of areas huge gulfs in those standards, but they do vary. For instance, in New Zealand you do not have to have as much fruit in the jam as you do in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more significant area, which is of some concern, relates to regulations on cadmium and heavy metals. Australia has quite tough standards on cadmium. I understand that New Zealand has made some kind of a commitment to move towards the international standard, but the international standard is not as tough as the Australian standard on cadmium either. We have had the assurance that the Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged. Can we have an assurance that products with cadmium and heavy metals in them will not be allowed into Australia if they do not meet the Australian cadmium and heavy metal standards, particularly during this transitional period? I accept that once we have passed the transitional period the arrangements will be settled commonly, but we do not want a window of opportunity for substandard products to come into Australia during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note the commitment by the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech that `third countries will not be able to circumvent the rigorous systems currently in place'. That commitment also, I presume, applies only to the time that the complete treaty is in operation. What is going to happen, though, during this window of opportunity? Will third countries be able to use New Zealand as a conduit to Australia and therefore avoid our standards? Again this issue of cadmium is significant. Chinese peanuts are infamous for their cadmium levels. The most commonly rejected foodstuff coming into Australia is peanuts. The most common country that they come from is China and the most common reason is cadmium. We do not want a situation to occur where Chinese peanuts are able to be imported into New Zealand, are packaged or ground up in New Zealand and then sent across to Australia thereby avoiding our cadmium laws. Those are areas where I would appreciate some clarification of the assurance that the parliamentary secretary has provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is that there is no time limit on the transitional provisions; there is no precise date for the conclusion of that transitional period. This window of opportunity could go on and on. Obviously if it stretches the friendship too far, the whole future of the treaty may be in doubt, but we do not want circumstances that are less than satisfactory to continue indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to paragraph 10(e), which is being amended in this the bill but is really not relevant to the Australia-New Zealand treaty. If we wanted to we could just amend that clause in a way that would accommodate the treaty requirements. I am aware that the government was never keen on the proviso, which was put into 10(e) on the insistence of the Democrats and the coalition, that Australian standards could not be lowered in achieving the objective of uniform international standards. The National Food Authority have never been keen on it. In fact, they recommended that it be repealed in their recent annual report. I am suspicious about the motivation behind this amendment. I accept the assurance that we have got something like 300 food standards and so far this has never been used. But maybe it has never been used because it is there. Because the knowledge is there that the standards cannot be lowered in this way, there has been no effort to move in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cadmium issue is currently before the National Food Authority. Australia's standards on cadmium are tougher than the international standards. I think we need to be convinced that Australians should accept higher levels of cadmium than we have to just because somebody in another part of the world thinks that standard is acceptable. We are able to produce foods in this country with very low levels of cadmium, and that is an advantage that we should not lightly let go. It is important for Australia to maintain standards and not be prepared to sacrifice them because some other countries are not able to achieve the same levels that we are able to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are some of the areas that have caused concern about the legislation but, as my colleague before me has stated, the overall objectives of this legislation and of this treaty are noble. They have potentially significant advantages to both Australia and New Zealand, and the signing of this treaty is something that Australia and New Zealand can feel justly proud of achieving. I am looking forward to the parliamentary secretary's response to these matters of concern so that we can give all Australians the confidence that the minister's assurances included in his second reading speech&mdash;that no Australian industry will be disadvantaged and that our standards will be maintained&mdash;can be honoured and that Australian consumers will get the benefit of this more competitive market, greater variety provided by additional products and a circumstance whereby Australian and New Zealand industry is able to work together to achieve objectives not only within our own two countries but on the international stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to thank the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), my colleagues from the Labor Party and all the members of the opposition for giving their support to the National Food Authority Amendment Bill. As the two previous speakers have indicated, this is an extremely important bill for this country. It establishes for the first time a closer relationship of a new type with New Zealand. As we face the 21st century, we have to ask ourselves: what is going to happen with our relationship with New Zealand? Are we going to be fair dinkum about making our relations closer?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important about this is that we will be jointly sharing and determining an important issue for this country and for New Zealand, that is, the standards for food. This joint determination process is the first of its kind to be put into place between Australia and New Zealand. We are going to have an Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council, which will be using scientists and information from Australia and New Zealand; it will have officers in Australia and in New Zealand. We are going to be working together, and the system will be of great advantage to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few concerns have been raised here and amongst the parties in the other place. Before I address those concerns, it is incumbent upon me to say that I have been parliamentary secretary in this area for less than two years, and in that time I have given priority to getting this result. It has not been achieved without the tremendous support of the National Food Authority and, in particular, its acting chairperson Mr Terry Slater, Mr Graham Peachey, Mr Preston, and my long-suffering assistant, Jonathan Benyei, who has been working very hard to bring all this together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points made by the member for Chisholm relating to getting our priorities correct with respect to this bill were completely valid. We must not lose this opportunity by bickering over small matters. That is not to say that the concerns raised by the member for Wide Bay are not important, but of the arguments he has presented the argument about 10(e), the clause which has created the most controversy, has been the weakest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As he himself said, the clause has never been used. It was put there in a different era, when international arrangements were different. Australia will have nine out of 10 votes on the new council. It is not likely that New Zealand, if there is unity on the Australian side, is going to succeed in allowing some standard to be lowered. It is simple logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are assurances within the system to protect Australian interests. There will be no lowering of Australian standards unless there is a determination within Australia itself to lower its own standards, and that is possible under the current act. So, using pure logic, the argument about 10 e) does not stand up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the organisations referred to, including a particular consumer organisation, have tried to make a whole argument about this clause 10(e). When I discussed the matter with them, they raised some of the matters raised by the member for Chisholm which do not relate to 10(e). As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker, whenever such concerns are brought to my attention I take them seriously. I discussed with them some of the issues that have also been raised by the member for Wide Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, let us take the question of the two New Zealand representatives on the authority and the fact that one of them may not be from a consumer organisation. I have said to consumer organisations that if they can put a persuasive argument that the board of the authority does not have sufficient weight from consumer organisations then I am prepared to consider under the existing clause the possibility of having an additional member of the board in relation to consumer interests. I make that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the question of whether Australian standards would be lowered, I have written to the spokesperson of the Australian Democrats on these matters, Senator Meg Lees. I want to read out part of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the National Food Authority, I am proud of Australia's excellent international reputation for its food standards and its food standards setting system. The purpose of the new arrangements between Australia and New Zealand is to strengthen, not weaken, our standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistency in standards will protect consumer safety as well as encourage trade between Australia and New Zealand. Whilst quality is essentially a market issue, I am determined that food quality will not be sacrificed by these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am most concerned that consumers should be confident that the protection afforded by our food standards to the Australian community and to our industry will not be lowered by either the new arrangements or changes to the current legislation. Food standards will continue to meet Australian needs, and variations to standards will not be made purely on commercial grounds if it adversely affects public health and safety, the provision of information to consumers or fair trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These principles were outlined at public consultations held by the National Food Authority in Melbourne on 3 October and in Sydney on 4 October this year to explain the operation of the harmonisation arrangements. I understand that consumer, industry and government representatives attended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only stress that the Government will not accept a lowering of food standards as a consequence of harmonisation. The authority will continue to place public health and safety and Australia's high standards as paramount concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that that gives an assurance on the general point with respect to the issues raised by the member for Wide Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the issue he raised on opt-out provisions, I have already said in the second reading speech that firstly it is clearly agreed by both sides that this opt-out provision will be used very rarely. Secondly, when it is used, the New Zealand ministerial representative will have to give written reasons to the National Food Standards Council as to why it was used. Clearly, that can be challenged and further questions can be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear understanding that this opt-out provision will only be used in very rare instances and that the whole aim of this exercise is to get harmony and unity in standards. New Zealand is a sovereign country and we have received a very big commitment from them. New Zealand is coming in with a minority vote on the council. New Zealand is trusting us and we have to show some trust in return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand has made it perfectly clear that it accepts this as an act of goodwill on our part. It is not something that we initiated. New Zealand made this very clear from the beginning. I know this because last year I went to New Zealand when there was a threat of the whole business collapsing. I negotiated with New Zealand ministers and representatives from a whole range of departments, including the Prime Minister's department. This was made perfectly clear to me at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Chisholm has pointed out, there is absolutely no reason why we cannot proceed. The clause has never been used. I have given many assurances in relation to the retention of our standards. As I pointed out, we have a very big say on the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wide Bay raised some important questions with respect to the transitional provisions. It is true that during the period of the transitional provisions there will be the application of both Australian and New Zealand standards within New Zealand so that, for example, a particular product can meet one or other standard. I want to put it on the record that it is not our intention to have the transitional provisions continue for a long period of time. New Zealand is very keen to sign the agreement on 5 December, but not for the reason that the member for Wide Bay suggested&mdash;that it will be my only opportunity to be involved in international affairs. I have already led quite a number of delegations and been involved in international affairs. The member may not be aware of that. However, that is not the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is that New Zealand is very keen because it wants to move to adopt a number of standards on 1 January or as early as possible. The transitional provisions for some products will be very limited because people are keen to get on with it. There may be cases where we have a longer transitional period; I can think of two situations. The member for Wide Bay asked what will happen if a product under the existing New Zealand standard&mdash;which was perhaps lower than the Australian standard&mdash;came into Australia. We have covered that possibility. If any concerns of that kind are brought to our attention we will use a clause in the agreed transitional arrangements to act to ensure that it does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have standards with the New Zealanders on this point. The industry concerned will have to show that it is disadvantaged. I am not saying that we will act on every instance where an industry thinks that there is some problem. The industry will have to present some case to establish that there is a disadvantage. I repeat that this is only intended to be a short period of transitional arrangements. The whole aim of the exercise is to institute unified standards as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wide Bay raised a matter of some importance&mdash;the cadmium and heavy metals issue. I want to make it perfectly clear that I have no intention whatsoever&mdash;neither does the federal government&mdash;of in any way reducing Australia's very high standards on cadmium and heavy metals, because that is very important to us. As you know, I am always concerned with health issues&mdash;and I will be making some announcements about the HUS, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, issue tomorrow. We will sustain the cadmium and heavy metals Australian standard and we will insist on that standard. We have already made that clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that any third party tries to get food with higher levels into Australia from New Zealand, we will stop that through the use of our provisions. We are not going to be in the business, in any way, of watering down the cadmium and heavy metals levels. We have dealt with most of the concerns that the member for Wide Bay has raised. I appreciate his raising those concerns. He asked for assurances from me and from the National Food Authority; I am giving him those assurances. On balance, the overwhelming case is for this legislation to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the parties in the Senate that are expressing some concerns to come to the party. I have already replied to many of their concerns through my replies to the member for Wide Bay, and I am happy to have even further discussions with them in the next 24 or 48 hours that are left for us to discuss the matters in the Senate. As the member for Wide Bay said, I have tried in this process to ensure that the treaty is not signed until we introduce the legislation and get as far as possible with it. I hope the legislation will be passed by people of goodwill so that we can proceed with full transparency to sign the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the event that for some reason&mdash;procedural or otherwise&mdash;the bill does not pass the Senate, it is the intention of the government to continue with it in the Senate in the New Year or, in the event that there is an election&mdash;hopefully we will win it, but who knows&mdash;we and the current opposition parties will be in a position to pass the bill through the Senate afterwards. There is overwhelming support for the bill by the major parties in the Senate. It is only because of the timetable and procedural problems existing this week that we may get into difficulties with that. I want to assure the House that I will do everything to get this legislation through and to sign this treaty on behalf of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA>The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1995 seeks to amend a number of provisions contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. These amendments are in keeping with the underlying policy objectives of the act and will assist in the achievement of a diverse Australian broadcasting industry that is efficient, competitive and responsive to audience needs. The bill incorporates provisions moved during debate in the Senate and passed by the Senate on 21 November 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with five main areas: the allocation of second commercial television and radio broadcasting licences in solus markets; a 15 per cent deemed `control' rule for the purposes of the control limits in the act; clarification of the minister's powers to add events to and remove events from a notice published under section 115 of the act&mdash;the `anti-siphoning list'&mdash;and the streamlining and clarification of a number of operational aspects of the anti-siphoning provisions affecting the acquisition of broadcasting rights by subscription television broadcasting licensees; cooperation between satellite subscription television broadcasting licensees A and B; and the widening of the review required under subsection 215(2) dealing with the operation of the pay TV `new Australian drama' licence condition.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Allocation of broadcasting licences in solus markets</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first series of provisions contained in the bill are designed to expedite the allocation of second commercial television and radio broadcasting licences in solus markets. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 August 1995, I announced the government's intention to amend section 39 in order to streamline the ABA's allocation of new commercial radio licences in those areas of Australia which currently receive only one commercial radio service. Enactment of this bill will honour that commitment and overcome existing impediments to the introduction of new commercial radio services to underserved communities which were unforeseen when the Broadcasting Services Act was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions to amend section 39 will allow the 55 solus commercial radio operators to introduce an additional commercial radio service in their markets in advance of the release of a final Licence Area Plan by the Australian Broadcasting Authority, providing benefits for many listeners in regional areas. This requirement has been a significant factor delaying the introduction of new services under section 39 in underserved communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new provisions, the ABA need only examine frequency availability in a market. A deadline for section 39 applications will avoid delays to any subsequent allocations by the ABA of licences for independent services. In some areas, services should be able to commence up to two years earlier than would be possible if the LAP process had to be first completed. An opportunity has also been taken to amend the eligibility requirements where two solus markets overlap. This will prevent a potentially inequitable outcome eventuating where one licensee could be denied an additional licence due to an overlap with a larger neighbouring solus market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the solus television market provisions in section 73 of the act were introduced earlier this year in the Communications and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. These amendments were directed at: providing a legally certain means for the ABA to allocate a second commercial licence in a solus market; imposing a requirement that the services continue to be operated for at least two years, and not separately transferred during this period; and enabling the ABA to conduct a price based allocation process at any time during the consideration of a section 73 application, to ascertain that there is no possibility that the second service could be provided by an independent operator rather than the incumbent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisions in this bill replace those in the Communications and Tourism Bill. The amendments further simplify and clarify the operation of the solus television provisions, which have also been made consistent, where appropriate, with the solus radio provisions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 June 1995, the government announced a package of changes to buttress and strengthen the current ownership and control provisions to reinforce the policy approach of the Broadcasting Services Act. The amendment to the 15 per cent control rule included in this bill followed a report by the ABA on the operations of the ownership and control rules in the act. That report drew attention to the perception that the existing 15 per cent rule was causing a degree of uncertainty within the industry and a lessening of public confidence in the predictability of the operation of the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason for this uncertainty was the requirement for the ABA to exercise a judgment in determining control in each particular instance. The government believes that the establishment of a 15 per cent limit, which no longer requires such a judgment to be made, will overcome these difficulties and provide greater transparency and certainty in the operation of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change and the associated grandfathering are being moved as provisions in this bill because the government considers the change to the 15 per cent company interest rule to be the most important element of the package announced on 27 June. The associated grandfathering provisions strike an appropriate balance between ensuring compliance with the new law and recognising the legitimacy of interests held under the old rules. The remaining elements of the 27 June package, particularly those relating to a wider definition of company interests and the associated grandfathering provisions, have involved more complex drafting than the 15 per cent rule and are thus being dealt with separately. </PARA>

Subscription television services, or pay TV services as they are more commonly known, are increasingly expanding the range of television programs available to Australian viewers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not everyone in Australia will want to, or may be able to afford to, subscribe to pay TV. It is for this reason that parliament included the provisions contained in section 115 which empower the minister to publish in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> any event of a kind that, in the opinion of the minister, the televising of which should be available free to the general public. On 31 May 1994, the minister announced details of a list of events that he specified under section 115 of the act in order to ensure that Australian television viewers would continue to see the most popular sporting events free of charge. We wish to stress that the anti-siphoning list is not a list of events reserved solely for free-to-air television. It is a list of events for which pay TV licensees cannot acquire exclusive rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-siphoning provisions have now been in force for over 12 months. During this time, subscription television services have commenced operation; the bill has been considered by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee; and the ABA has issued its first monitoring report pursuant to the minister's direction of 22 December 1994. A wide range of issues have been publicly canvassed in these contexts. This bill makes it absolutely clear that the minister may amend a notice under subsection 115(1) to add events or remove events&mdash;for reasons other than but including those contained in the existing subsection 115(2)&mdash;from the anti-siphoning list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will note that the bill also describes certain circumstances where the minister may wish to exercise his power to remove an event from the list. The examples of such circumstances are contained in a note under the subsection. The first example essentially corresponds to the circumstances set out in the current subsection 115(2) of the act, where the national broadcasters and commercial licensees have had a real opportunity to acquire the right to televise an event but none of them has acquired the right within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example deals with the situation where the `hoarding' of an event occurs. This example is where a commercial television broadcasting licensee has acquired the right to televise an event but has failed to televise it or has televised only an unreasonably small proportion of the event. I stress that the minister's power to remove events from the anti-siphoning list is not confined to these examples. They have been inserted for illustrative purposes only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been the government's expectation that pay TV will complement and expand the coverage of sport provided by free to air television. There must be a balance between the advantages conferred by the anti-siphoning provisions on free to air broadcasters and the opportunity for pay TV licensees to operate commercially with access to the broadcast rights of listed events not acquired, or not televised, by free to air broadcasters. This bill will provide the means for better achieving that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A mechanism is proposed which will permit the automatic removal of events from a notice under subsection 115(1) 168 hours, or seven days, from the completion of the event.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to allow the allocation of second commercial television broadcasting licences in single markets and to streamline the allocation of commercial radio broadcasting licences in single markets. It also includes a fixed 15 per cent deemed control rule for the purposes of the control limits in the act. It also purports to improve the operation of the anti-siphoning provisions affecting the acquisition of broadcasting rights by subscription television broadcasting licensees A and B and widen the review required under subsection 215(2) to encompass Australian content on subscription television broadcasting services generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of this bill is relatively uncontroversial. The coalition supports the substance of the provisions for the allocation of commercial television broadcasting licences in single markets. As far as commercial radio licences are concerned, under the old section 39 the ABA was required to allocate an additional commercial radio broadcasting licence to any single incumbent provided that there were at least two spare commercial radio licences. Legal advice to the ABA was that this condition could not be satisfied without the completion of a licence area plan. Delays in the preparation of licence area plans in most areas of Australia have meant that no additional licences have been allocated to single radio operators anywhere in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments replace the old section 39. Apart from minor clarification of the circumstances under which an additional licence may be allocated, there are several significant changes. Firstly, the ABA may not allocate an additional licence unless it is of the opinion that a suitable broadcasting spectrum is available. While existing frequency allotment plans lapse and ministerial reservations must be taken into account, the ABA may form such an opinion in their absence. These changes will allow the ABA to allocate additional commercial radio licences immediately rather than wait for the completion of a LAP in a licence area. The ABA must attach technical conditions to an additional licence in the absence of a LAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the ABA may not allocate an additional licence in a licence area when there is excessive overlap between the area and a different service licensed in another area. The test for excessive overlap is being changed to make it easier for smaller commercial broadcasters to get an additional licence where their service area is substantially overlapped by another single operator who is entitled to a second channel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, to encourage early applications for additional licences, prospective licensees will have 60 days after the proclamation of the amendments in which to lodge an application for an additional licence. Special provision is made for incumbent licensees to make an application later if they subsequently become eligible for an additional licence. Applications may also be lodged in anticipation of changes in relevant industry conditions which might make an incumbent licensee eligible for an additional licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are long overdue. Since 1984 the government has been promising supplementary licences in single markets. With an election imminent, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has said that he will fix the problem by allocating additional commercial licences and, at the same time, allowing the ABA to call for additional licence applications. The ABA process will continue. In theory, once they have completed an area, they release the plan and are able to call for supplementary licences. But, to date, only one licence, as I said, has been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has long advocated these changes. Whether it was because of obtuseness or ignorance, or a combination of both, the fact is that the minister simply appeared to be blind to those calls until he recently attended the conference of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. At that conference, the minister was told the facts of life and, as a result of that political pressure, he has introduced this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry made it clear to the minister that they were simply not prepared to stand by and see a process continue in a way that was so very similar, as the House will recall, to the pay television saga. When the coalition was in government in 1980, we gave the green light to pay television and, 15 years later, it is finally coming to fruition. The radio industry saw that a repetition of that fiasco was all too likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is gratifying of course that the minister has now acknowledged the point the industry had been making for quite some time. But it is disappointing that, in this area as in so many others, it was really only a response to political pressure that led to this action. We see so little genuine initiative coming through in this portfolio under this minister. We can only assume that this was a portfolio that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had little interest in, and that is why we had to wait quite some time until this particular problem was remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the anti-siphoning provisions are concerned, let me just say that this has been another farcical episode in the history of this portfolio. We can recall that, more than 12 months ago, after the Pakistan cricket series, the suggestion was made that the series be taken off the anti-siphoning list. After stalling for a number of months, the minister said that he would refer the matter to the ABA. The result was that we did not get a decision on whether it ought to be made available to the pay television operators for something like 12 months after the event. Again, that is an absolute absurdity. It is not clear what the minister is thinking, but we finally do at least have legislation which will make some effort to address one aspect of the anti-siphoning legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other provisions that I do not want to spend a great deal of time on. The cross-media provisions between the satellite licensees generally make sense. I will now come to the notorious `Get Packer' amendments in this piece of legislation. These amendments typify everything that is wrong with the government's approach to media policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody thinks for a moment that these provisions have come forward as a result of an initiative of the minister. They have paw prints all over them, and those prints are the prints of the Prime Minister. The minister is really just a political doormat to the Prime Minister's office in this regard. Communications policy is driven by heavily political and partisan agendas. All too often, the policies simply reflect the Prime Minister's likes, dislikes and temporary hatreds of particular people in the media industry rather than any concept of what is desirable in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a long time since the national interest really governed media policy in this area, and this bill simply shows again how hopelessly politicised the area has become. I am sure that the Australian people would like to see a very different approach in communications policy, and they will regard with contempt the way in which the government is handling policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the Prime Minister is simply pursuing a vendetta against one media baron whilst desperately trying not to upset another one. Of course, even his efforts to curry favour or to intimidate have very little effect on the media barons who are the object of his policy, because I think both Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch have made it absolutely clear in the public domain in recent times what a disgrace they think the Australian economy is under his government and how appalling they believe the level of youth unemployment is&mdash;and, of course, quite justifiably so as we now have youth unemployment at 29 per cent and we have the government ceasing the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics in an attempt to hide the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government which has completely lost focus on the national interest and is being driven by the Prime Minister's office without adequate consultation with the party or the minister in areas which attract the Prime Minister's attention. Again and again we see this particular minister being left high and dry as he fails to keep up with the rapid shifts in the Prime Minister's mood and political tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cross-media rules were designed to ensure plurality and diversity but the proposals in this bill do absolutely nothing to achieve that. They simply impose an arbitrary 15 per cent, irrespective of the notion of control&mdash;in fact, they ignore that. So you can have nonsensical situations such as where Prime television is in excess of 15 per cent as far as Sunshine is concerned; Seven is clearly in control because it has in excess of 50 per cent, yet Prime would be deemed to be in control under these arrangements. There is no discretion here; simply two quite conflicting commercial interests, yet both are regarded as being in absolute control. It is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at statements by the minister to realise how farcical and insincere these amendments are. In August 1994 the minister was saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's cross-media ownership rules are working well.</PARA>
<PARA>In February of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm quite happy to leave the responsibility with the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA>On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on 20 February this year the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Control is the key. Control is fundamental to promoting diversity and under the act control is the trip-wire. In some ways it doesn't matter whether somebody's above or below the 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>When he said that the minister was absolutely correct. What is the relevance of the 15 per cent? It is an entirely arbitrary and capricious concept. It is meaningless. Cross-media rules are all about trying to ensure that people are not in a position to control more than one market. Yet the legislation simply fails to address adequately this issue of control and opts instead for this quite arbitrary 15 per cent limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the minister has been completely humiliated in this area because, not only having said that the rules were working well, he probably also had in mind his master's voice back in late 1994 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program when it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't even try to be confident about resisting the shift of these technologies. I mean, it's not going to be very long. Here's News Ltd with Star TV. What are you going to do about that? Poke your tongue at it? Throw a bill up in the air? Table a motion in the House?</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, at that time the Prime Minister was quite relaxed about the need for an overhaul of the existing cross-media rules. Indeed, the minister himself was promising that earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there will be a review&mdash;and there should be&mdash;and that review ought to precede any of the changes, but that is not the case. The high-water mark of hypocrisy in this area arises when one looks back to several media releases by the minister on 3 May and 27 June in which it was said that the 15 per cent fixed ownership limit would be applied to the control provisions in the act. It was also said that company interests currently caught by the act would be widened to include interests that are linked to company performance and that this would also apply to future foreign interests&mdash;there would be grandfathering arrangements. Despite all that, those provisions are not in this bill and they have simply been put to one side. The minister says, `They are too difficult to draft.' I do not think anybody believes for a moment that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told, if you read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, that the minister still has plans for subsequent amendments to come before the parliament. But it is quite clear that the minister is still casting about trying to decide what to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we will not be supporting these changes. We make it perfectly clear that, if the government is in any shape or form serious, which it is not, about having an effective cross-media regime, then it ought to do what the act requires and what it has promised: to commence the review under the Broadcasting Services Act, taking account of what is happening around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply another classic example of the way in which the Prime Minister is politicising every area of national policy. It is a government where standards have essentially collapsed, a government which no longer enforces decent standards of conduct amongst its ministers, a government which has lost sight of the national interest, a government which has no idea how to correct the disgraceful mess in the economy: rising youth unemployment and rising youth suicide. It is a government which has lost its way. Nowhere is this clearer than in the communications area where we have a minister who, far from exercising any kind of leadership or direction in the area, is simply the pawn of the Prime Minister, the cat's paw which does the Prime Minister's political bidding, whatever it may be for the time being, and we certainly will not have any of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that I certainly reject the most unfair personal criticism labelled at the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). If we are objective about looking at the record of the minister in a whole range of portfolio responsibilities, we will acknowledge that he is a minister who can indeed hold his head very high. It is in that sense, in particular, in relation to the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill and the streamlining of the operation of section 39 that I want to speak during the debate this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 39 provides for the allocation of a second commercial radio licence to incumbent broadcasters in markets where there is only one commercial radio service. All of these areas are largely in rural Australia, which I am sure you would be aware of, Mr Deputy Speaker. Certainly in my electorate of Calare there are a number of commercial radio services which operate, essentially, in a solus market arrangement&mdash;Orange and Bathurst being the two largest centres where that applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original intention of section 39 was to get new services into regional and rural Australia as quickly as possible but because of a legal interpretation of the act the Australian Broadcasting Authority had to complete its planning processes before new services could be given the go ahead. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a delay of those new services into regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will remove the requirement for the Australian Broadcasting Authority to first complete a licence area plan before allocating a second licence on application to an incumbent licensee in the solus market. The requirement has been a significant factor in delaying the introduction of new services in underserved communities. Under the new provisions, the Australian Broadcasting Authority need only examine frequency availability in a market. A deadline for section 39 applications will avoid delays to any subsequent allocations by the Australian Broadcasting Authority of licences for independent services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, this bill means that over 50 regional areas in Australia can apply to have a new FM commercial radio service next year if current station owners apply to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a new commercial radio service licence. I know that this will be of great benefit to a whole range of operators in solus markets right throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity in the context of this debate to use the example of a radio station in my area that for years has been looking forward to the day on which it is able to switch on an FM service. I refer to stereo 2BS in Bathurst, which essentially has an FM studio and transmission equipment to commence broadcasting once the provisions receive royal assent and the Australian Broadcasting Authority issues a new licence. It is appropriate that next year is the 60th anniversary of radio 2BS receiving its original commercial licence. Therefore, it will be a very timely anniversary for this station to be able to have a second service to provide greater diversity and choice of programming to the people of Bathurst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I can further illustrate some of the frustrations and challenges this has meant to operators by continuing to refer to the example in my area. The reality today is that it may be possible to operate two theoretically competing stations in Bathurst. With the advent of satellite technology, that is clearly possible. Similarly, if you have syndicated programming arrangements from major capital cities being piped into an area, you could operate a second service. But what that does is deny to the people of the area a great deal of localism. Stations like 2BS have prided themselves on their capacity to serve a wide range of community and business needs within that market for almost 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the credibility of this particular radio station, let me indicate some of the ways in which the station goes about its community involvement and responsibilities, not because it seeks to be simply a good corporate citizen, if you like, but because this station and its very dedicated staff realise that it has a duty to serve the community in which it lives and operates its service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stereo 2BS's community spirit has been recognised on many occasions. It has received two Westpac awards, three Westpac commendations, a `Raward' for a full year's community service and a tidy towns media award. Recently the owner of the station received an Order of Australia medal for services to radio and to the community, which I think again signifies the high regard Mr Camplin is held in by the community. In the past 12 months the station has been the primary promoter of a cancer care cottage appeal which raised $75,000 in one day from a service area of about 35,000 people. The station has also continued the promotion of this much needed community facility and now this appeal stands, as I understand it, at over $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember the station being involved in a whole range of other activities over the years: the appeal of Jaws of Life for victims in motor vehicle accidents, the 1986 and 1990 floods in the Bathurst area, bushfire appeals, the Bathurst Base Hospital children's ward appeal and appeals for families whose homes had been destroyed by fire or families who had been left in rather desperate circumstances. This is a community spirit which I am sure is exemplified by many other solus radio markets right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing about these solus market operators that may not necessarily be amplified right throughout regional Australia is the loyalty and the support of their staff. Some staff at this radio station have been there for an extraordinary number of years. The breakfast announcer has been there for 23 years; the morning radio announcer has been there 15 years. I think that prior to coming to federal parliament I taught half the staff at the radio station. People there have had 13 years, 16 years and 17 years experience in the industry. The chief technician at the station, Mr Upfold, has had over 43 years of experience working at Stereo 2BS in Bathurst. That indicates that here is a station with a great community spirit and a station that is very keen to allow the opportunity presented to it by this amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act to provide even additional services to a community that it has served with such distinction over a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned that this amendment will also increase people's choice of broadcasting services in other country areas right throughout Australia, not only in areas like Bathurst and Orange within my own electorate but in other parts of New South Wales, like the cities and communities of Armidale, Dubbo, Gunnedah, Griffith and Cooma; in Queensland, centres like Gympie, Longreach, Nambour and Roma; in Victoria, Ballarat, Wangaratta; in South Australia, Mount Gambier, and Renmark in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew; in Western Australia, Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland, Albany and Carnarvon; in Tasmania, Queenstown and Scottsdale; and Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a very much appreciated amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act. I know the excitement that it caused and the reaction of Mr Camplin from 2BS when Minister Lee, at the FARB convention in August, announced it. Not only the owner but the whole of the staff and the listening audience of Bathurst in general will be very much appreciative of this amendment when it passes the House. It will allow greater diversity and choice for country people. It does recognise the issues of viability and commerciality of relatively small radio stations operating in solus markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment increases that diversity and choice. For that reason, I warmly congratulate the minister on behalf of my radio station, which is very much appreciative of his work in putting this amendment forward.

I wholly support the amendment and commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the introduction of the provisions of the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill dealing with the introduction of broadcasting licences in solus markets. I represent a country area, a regional area, of Australia in north-east Victoria. For a long time now, radio station 3NE in Wangaratta has been endeavouring to provide an additional service to its coverage area but has been prevented from doing so because of the difficulties of the existing legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this bill and wish it a very speedy passage through the parliament. I thank the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), who is in the House at the moment, for his recognition of the need to introduce the change to the existing legislation and thus facilitate the operation of radio stations, particularly in country areas like mine, which are very anxious to provide the additional FM radio service. Very briefly, the legislation expedites the allocation of what is called the second commercial television and radio broadcasting licence in solus markets. This follows the government's announcement in August 1995 that it intended to amend section 39, which is the section that has been the problem, the obstacle, in dealing efficiently and quickly with applications for new commercial radio licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill will enable the ABA to quickly overcome the existing impediments to the introduction of the new radio licence. Thus it will enable stations like radio station 3NE in Wangaratta to increase the service to what is regarded at the moment by the radio station as an underserved community&mdash;not through any fault of radio station 3NE which has wanted to provide the service but has been prevented from doing so because of the unforeseen consequences of the existing Broadcasting Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I understand it, the provisions to amend section 39 will allow some 55 solus commercial radio operators to introduce an additional commercial radio service in their markets. The provisions enable the ABA to do that without having regard to a number of factors other than the transmission capabilities. I think that is, in essence, what the amendment does. Certainly, radio station 3NE has the capability, the expertise, the experience, the will, the enthusiasm and all that is needed to get this service up and running quickly to provide the additional FM service to the community it covers in north-east Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I promised I would be short. I am going to conclude by mentioning that radio station 3NE serves a very important part of the community operation. It is a radio station that has given a deep commitment not only to its customers and its advertisers&mdash;the lifeblood of any radio station&mdash;but also to the community in the way in which it has sponsored, supported, encouraged, publicised and become involved in many community activities such as supporting the local hospitals when they have needed help, as well as Legacy appeals and Salvation Army Red Shield appeals. In virtually every facet of society in a region like north-east Victoria you will find that radio station 3NE plays its part in promoting and assisting particularly the volunteers in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the management and staff of radio station 3NE for their dedication and for their achievements to date. I know that they will be happy to receive the news&mdash;when I ring them in a moment&mdash;about this legislation going through this parliament. It has gone through the Senate. I hope the minister has got his car waiting to go up to His Excellency the Governor-General. We hope that we can see this piece of legislation enacted and proclaimed as law in this great country&mdash;perhaps even, by some miracle, by Friday evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess after hearing the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) you would have to think that 3NE and 2BS would certainly need to run their local member a bit more and 2GO would certainly need to run the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) a whole lot more, because I have never seen two better ads for their local radio stations. Some people would tell you that the minister probably only did this to help 2GO anyway. I think the comments that people have made on the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill show the importance of radio particularly in regional Australia, which is sometimes missed by people in the capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Indi said, this bill has been before the Senate and has gone to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. The committee has suggested some amendments. The government has also suggested some amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the amendments will improve radio broadcasting services to communities that have only one service by speeding up the process for allocation of the second licence and, similarly, allowing allocation of the second commercial TV licence in such markets. The legislation also further clarifies the ownership and control provisions, specifying a 15 per cent limit. It will tighten up the anti-siphoning provisions for the acquisition of broadcasting rights by pay TV operators and it will ensure that satellite TV licences A and B can cooperate with each other without breaching the control provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Calare and the member for Indi have said, commercial radio licences in solus markets is an issue that has been in people's minds for some time. Under the current provisions of the Broadcasting Act the ABA is required to prepare a licence area plan for radio broadcasters. That procedure has meant lengthy delays in establishing extra radio services for communities where there is only one broadcaster. In August the minister announced that that process would be speeded up to allow extra services for such communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes mean that some communities will get an extra service up to two years earlier. This will be of great benefit for those 50 or more areas which are currently serviced by only one radio station. These are all stations that are outside the capitals and the large urban areas of Australia. For many years&mdash;for generations in fact&mdash;most of those places have not had any choice at all. This process will create a bit more diversity in commercial radio outside the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA has undertaken some technical planning to make sure that a suitable frequency is available. Whilst that may delay things a little, the process will be a lot quicker than preparing a licence area plan. These amendments are in line with the objectives of the Broadcasting Services Act of encouraging greater diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bill the provisions for commercial TV licences in solus markets are also brought into line with these new provisions for radio licences so that once again we have more diversity and greater facilities are provided for people in country Australia. These provisions are a good example of the government's commitment to ensuring equity of access to information services throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we sometimes forget how big a place Australia is. When we think that 30 years ago very few homes in Australia had television, we realise how far we have come in communications technology. Things are moving so fast now that legislation may sometimes be a step behind what is happening in the technological area. These amendments are part of a process of responding to the communication needs of Australia swiftly and fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point I note that the comments by opposition senators during the debate on the bill in the Senate were rather petty. Senator Tierney complained that we did not get the regulation of pay TV right initially and he did not think that this bill was the right answer. After saying all that, he said that he was going to support it anyway. I was equally astounded to see that the opposition criticised the government for not developing planning strategies for pay TV and communications generally, yet they have come up with no other suggestion, constructive or otherwise, as an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Senator Tierney said that what had absolutely amazed him was how rapidly this field had developed and how the landscape in pay TV now looked so totally different from the way it looked at the time of the pay TV inquiry. He criticised the government in the press for not foreseeing how pay TV would turn out, but at the same time he admits that he did not foresee it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas where the government has needed to make some change and the ownership and control provisions is one of those areas. These changes were announced on 27 June this year by the minister, following a report from the ABA. The changes mean that there will be a fixed 15 per cent ownership limit in all areas; that is, a 75 per cent audience reach limit, the one licence to a market limit, the cross-media ownership rules and the foreign ownership rules&mdash;which members will note are already capped at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are designed to strengthen the media ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act. There were problems with the existing control test, which was subject to any number of interpretations of the meaning of control. Depending upon which lawyer you went to see or which proprietor you talked to, they all had a different view of what control meant. I recall seeing one article in the press that suggested that you could own 20 or 30 per cent of the shares in a company but arrange your situation so that you did not actually have any control; or you could own five per cent and it could be said that you dominated it. The argument went on and on about what was the control provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By fixing the ownership limit at 15 per cent and retaining the control test for interests under this 15 per cent mark, there will be much more certainty about what the government means by control and that will provide more certainty for the industry. By removing the opportunity for people to prove that they did not control a company at levels greater than 15 per cent, we are tightening the threshold. All the evidence points to the need for it to be tightened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new rules, if a person holds more than 15 per cent of an interest in a company they will be deemed to be in control, without the need for an inquiry. Obviously, this will make the ABA's task easier and more transparent. Diversity of control of the media in Australia is one of the objectives of the legislation and is always one of the government's main concerns. Diversity of ownership and avoidance of concentrated control furthers these other objectives of competition, plurality and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some media owners, of course, have complained that these provisions are specifically directed at them. We have heard the opposition suggest this as well. That is simply not the case. The ABA reported on its investigations into the control of the Fairfax newspaper group&mdash;and these measures are a response to that report. The provisions will place limits on News Ltd's interests in the Seven Network as well as PBL's and CPH's cross-media interests in the Fairfax group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The startling thing about the 15 per cent control provisions is that the opposition voted against them in the Senate. They refused to support the amendment to set a fixed 15 per cent cross-media limit. Once again it seems that the government&mdash;Mr Howard commented about Mr Black wanting to acquire a larger share in Fairfax last week&mdash;has to try to divine what the opposition's policy is. Obviously, the proprietors and the industry are trying to divine that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You seem to have to wait for a particular circumstance. It is just like a piece of litmus paper. You dip the opposition into the cauldron of media regulation and you see what colour they turn. If it was not for the fact that they have to respond to pieces of legislation that the government brings in, we might never get an inkling of what their policies are. The government's policy on media ownership is clear. The minister articulated our view on newspaper percentages very sharply last week and the opposition would do well to take the same point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also provided some amendments in this legislation to the anti-siphoning provisions. Members will recall that, after the initial excitement about pay TV, people started to ask questions about what sort of programs they would see. The answer from the operators was, `Everything you are seeing now and a hundred times more'. One of the big drawcards was the prospect of being able to view all the big sporting matches that are not currently run on the commercial networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was greeted with great interest by people, but then questions started to be asked about the events that people do see on the commercial networks. Would pay TV buy up everything so that you would be forced to subscribe to pay TV to watch, say, your local rugby league game or the cricket test matches? Would pay TV start to provide only synopses of those games? Would we see the unfortunate paring down of the match of the day on free-to-air television now from 80 minutes to 60 minutes? Would it become 15 minutes of highlights? They were people's genuine concerns. The government's response to those concerns was the anti-siphoning provisions, which have worked reasonably well. The government did not want to see a situation arising where people who could not afford to subscribe to pay TV would not be able to watch the programs they currently enjoy on free-to-air television. This would not be in line with the government's policies of diversity and equity of access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act the minister can list events which cannot be exclusively acquired by pay TV licensees. This list does not reserve the events for free-to-air TV, but gives free-to-air broadcasters the first opportunity to acquire those rights. It does not mean that the events cannot be broadcast on pay TV. That was an assumption of some people out in the community. The Minster for Communications last year published a list of events which included the Melbourne Cup, the AFL, the ARL and rugby union, test and world series cricket, major tennis opens, major soccer and netball matches and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have discovered over the last year or more since the list has been in existence is that there are problems not with the minister putting items on the list but with taking events off the list. It is no use having events listed if the commercial networks have no intention of screening them, to hoard the event and prevent pay TV from screening it. That is not the purpose of the list. The amendments before the House provide for the automatic removal of events from the list seven days after completion of the event. This would give the broadcaster a reasonable opportunity to cover the event and pay TV operators the opportunity to pick up the event if they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendments proposed, the minister's power to amend the list of events will be discretionary rather than limited to the circumstances described in the current section 115, subsection (2). Examples of circumstances where the minister may want to exercise this power are given as notes under the subsection. This may be where commercial broadcasters have a real opportunity to apply rights to televise but have not done so or where a commercial broadcaster is hoarding an event, buying a right so that a pay TV operator cannot screen it, but not screening it themselves. It is the government's hope that these changes will have the dual purpose of ensuring that Australians who cannot afford to subscribe to pay TV will be able to view major sporting events and other cultural events, but at the same time ensure that commercial broadcasters&mdash;the free-to-air people&mdash;do not abuse their first pick privileges. A national or commercial broadcaster must have acquired the rights to televise a listed event to an area exceeding 50 per cent of the population of Australia before pay TV operators can do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will realise that this bill encompasses some much needed reforms to the broadcasting industry. They are attempts to catch up with reality. As all members who want to sensibly follow issues in the broadcasting and communications area will realise, technology takes no account of regulation. The government is ensuring that we set a framework where we can get quick changes where necessary but that will enhance and improve the diversity and access of broadcasting services across Australia, which can only improve the quality of services that people receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, as this legislation relates to the regional market, for the first time in many years there will be a lot more diversity for people in regional Australia. The additional radio and television licences that one can have in those solus markets will be of significant benefit to the people in those markets. It will also help the further development of commercial radio in Australia, which tends to be the prime information source for Australians. I commend the bill to the House and commend the minister for his quick action on these problems. </PARA>

The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) challenged me to jump in the car and rush out to Government House as soon as the debate is concluded to ensure that this Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is proclaimed. The reason I was not here for the second reading speech is that, as a member of the Executive Council, I was at Government House about issues that have been decided by cabinet in the past. So I will have to wait for another time to go back to Government House on this legislation. Naturally, the government is very keen for a number of measures in this legislative package to go through as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation for the support that I have received. People like the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and Rob Allen and others in the Bathurst district have supported a speeding up of the process of section 39. FARB and people like Tony King have been extremely helpful in trying to make sure that we could address the very complex legal issues that have had to be considered and balanced in putting together this package for radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the one issue in the package that continues to divide the government and the opposition, which is whether we should move away from a control test in the cross-media ownership rules to an upper limit of 15 per cent. That is the one issue that the opposition spokesman has indicated we will be dealing with in the consideration in detail stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's view that, having received the ABA's report into the control of the Fairfax group early this year, there really was an increase in the amount of uncertainty in the broadcasting industry about how well the cross-media ownership rules would be applied in the future. It is for that reason that the government decided that there should be an upper limit. We then sought the advice of the Broadcasting Authority as to what number that limit should be. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firm conclusion of the ABA's report, after looking at all the various options, was that 15 per cent would be the fairest and would follow past practice to the closest degree. For that reason, the government has picked a number out of many that were considered by the Broadcasting Authority. We have responded to the concern in the industry that we needed to buttress and strengthen the cross-media ownership rules. We have wanted them to stay there. We have done that in a calm and rational way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's response to this has unfortunately been to dub these as the `Get Packer' amendments. It is true that they affect Mr Packer in that, as long as he maintains ownership of Channel 9, he will not be able to buy more of the Fairfax group. Otherwise he would be in a position to own an unacceptable level of Channel 9 in Sydney and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>in Sydney and Channel 9 in Melbourne and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>in Melbourne. That is why we have these cross-media ownership rules, which try to limit the cross-media ownership of various media entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as it affects Mr Packer, it affects News Ltd and Mr Murdoch. Their investment in Channel 7 is also restricted by their investments in newspapers. Under these rules, News Ltd will not be able to purchase more than 15 per cent of Channel 7 in Sydney, because they own the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS>in Sydney. Because they own the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne, they will not be able to own more than 15 per cent of Channel 7 in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That limit is not an attempt to get any particular media proprietor; it is a matter of responding to the concern in the industry that the ABA report into the Fairfax ownership and control issues left open the chance that people could significantly increase their investments in cross-media holdings. This limit will ensure we do get the diversity that everyone in this parliament says they support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say it is important for Australia to have a number of media owners because that increases the chances of different points of view being covered in the media. In fact, I would suggest that by buttressing and strengthening those cross-media ownership rules we are trying to achieve the goals of a number of petitioners&mdash;including perhaps the shadow minister, who will speak in a few minutes, but certainly the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)&mdash;who in 1991 argued that the Fairfax group should not be sold to anyone, such as Mr Packer, if that resulted in increased media concentration in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who signed that petition certainly subscribed to the theory that diverse ownership is healthy for public policy in Australia and that we should try to maximise the number of media owners in Australia. I do not understand why the people who signed that petition in 1991&mdash;which said that Fairfax should not be owned by Mr Packer, or other people, if that concentrated the media&mdash;are today saying that it is unfair to put a cap of 15 per cent on these cross-media investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, it comes down to one question: should a person be able to own a television station and a mass circulation newspaper in the same city? If Mr Howard says yes to that question, he is saying that one person can reach 75 per cent of the population through the TV stations of pretty well all the capital cities as well as all the newspapers. So you are not just saying it is in one city; you are saying it is in enough cities to reach 75 per cent of the population right round Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the government side, we think that is giving one person, whomever that person may be, too much power. We do not think a person should control a TV station and a mass circulation newspaper in a capital city. That is why we stand by the cross-media ownership rules. That is why we are buttressing and strengthening them today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's response at the moment is that it will hold a review. I noticed in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that Tom Burton made the following remark:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coalition has been highly critical of many aspects of the Government's communications policy, but when it comes to articulating its own position it has resisted making firm commitments&mdash;instead using the time-honoured technique of promising a review.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the current position of Senator Alston and the Leader of the Opposition. Senator Alston's position has evolved over time. Initially in a few debates in the Senate he argued that the 15 per cent allowable cross-media ownership limit was too high and that perhaps it should be five per cent or zero, then he argued that perhaps it was too low. Lately he seems to be articulating the position that a review should be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that the people in the gallery and the voters of Australia would like to know where the opposition stands on this important public policy issue before the election, not after some uncertain review is conducted in a year or two if the opposition wins the next election. For that reason, we do not think it is good enough for the opposition to say this will be decided some time in the future. We think the issue is too important for it to be decided after the election. The people of Australia have a right to know where the opposition stands on this important issue, just as they know where the government stands: we think those cross-media ownership rules should be buttressed and strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voters have every reason to be a bit worried because the Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying that he thinks the cross-media ownership rules should not be on the statute books. He thinks they should be abolished and, in his opinion, should rely only on the Trade Practices Act. This is the position he articulated when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the mid-1980s, a position he has repeated in the year he has had his second go at being the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission knows anything about this, it would mean that there would be no restrictions on owning newspapers and television stations in the same city. The claim that in some way you can rely on the Trade Practices Act to stop these cross-media ownership constructions coming together has been shot down by Professor Fels. It is really a bit of a cover for the Leader of the Opposition letting slip his long-term view that people should be able to build up mass concentrations of media across television and newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, the government is not prepared to accept the opposition position to delete the attempts in this legislation to provide that certainty, to provide that cap of 15 per cent on cross-media ownership.

This position is the government's position today. It has been the government's position for a short time. It is a position which the government appears to have adopted when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) became distressed over remarks that Mr Packer had made, indicating that perhaps Mr Packer saw the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) as a satisfactory alternative Prime Minister. That infuriated the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the government to claim that its position is clear will convince no-one. It has made changes without conducting any substantial review in this area, as the opposition has called for&mdash;a review which could provide the basis for a clear, long-term and agreed national strategy in this area. Instead of laying this firm foundation for a stable policy, all that is clear is that this is the government's current position. What is not clear is whether or not this position is going to be stable into the future. It is clearly not the position that the government has advocated in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have made it quite plain that we believe this is a politically motivated amendment to the legislation. It symbolises the way in which this government is going about the politicisation of this and other areas of policy. I have some sympathy for Minister Lee, who is at the table, in that when you have a Prime Minister who is essentially now out of control, who is rampaging through the party and the policy areas as they take his fancy and as they express his current political views, he demeans everybody on his side of the parliament in the process. </PARA>

That is why, in the end, leaders like this do not last. That is why, in the end, leaders like this cannot give certainty to anybody. Nobody knows what the next preference of the Prime Minister will be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It gives me great pleasure today to table these three reports by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I shall briefly talk to each report in turn, starting on report 341 on financial reporting for the Commonwealth. The recommendations in this report, if adopted by the government, will result in the most significant changes to financial reporting for the Commonwealth since federation. In this report, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts maintains the momentum for moving the Commonwealth away from its often outdated cash accounting system into the accrual accounting culture. Australian business, of course, has long operated in the accrual accounting environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many members would be aware, accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they are incurred, irrespective of whether cash is paid or received. Accrual accounts for government departments would include depreciation and assets, employee entitlements such as long service leave and the value of goods and services received free from the Commonwealth or other bodies. Accrual information better reflects the true cost of providing services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics advised the committee that, by the turn of the century, the International Monetary Fund will be requiring accrual based information from statistically advanced nations. The recommendations in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability</EMPHASIS>, if adopted, will ensure that Australia is well placed to meet international requirements for accrual information on the financial position of the Commonwealth by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer (Mr Willis), announced that the financial reporting framework for Commonwealth agencies would be recast to reflect accrual accounting concepts. For the 1994-95 financial year, all government budget sector agencies have submitted annual financial statements on an accrual basis, most for the first time. The challenge now is to move all aspects of Commonwealth financial management, including the Commonwealth budget cycle, into the accrual environment. The committee takes up the challenge in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Building on the recommendations contained in report 338, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accrual accounting: a cultural change</EMPHASIS>, the committee proposes in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability</EMPHASIS> that the accrual reports of government agencies, including government business enterprises, should be consolidated into an accrual based whole of government report for the Commonwealth. But the preparation of whole of government reports is not the final stage in the transition from a cash to an accrual culture. There is little point in preparing the latest and greatest financial reports for the Commonwealth unless there is also a mechanism for feeding this information into financial planning and ultimately into the budget. If the Commonwealth produces excellent whole of government reports that sit on the shelf, the whole exercise will have been an horrendous waste of administrative resources. What's more, government agencies cannot be expected to take accrual reporting and accounting seriously if they are still required to budget on a cash basis and continue to be funded by cash appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the committee proposes a financial reporting framework that ties the budget process into the accrual environment. At the moment, the form and content of the budget papers is at the discretion of governments and their advisers and there are no plans to move the budget process away from cash reporting. If the government ignores the recommendations in the committee's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability</EMPHASIS>, the media and the community will continue to focus undue attention on the cash deficit or surplus. It is just not sensible for the Commonwealth budget cycle to continue on a cash basis once government agencies have moved to accrual reporting and once the Commonwealth itself has started to publish accrual based whole of government reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been enough confusion about the Commonwealth's financial position when all the Commonwealth's financial reports have been prepared on the same basis. The prospect of having the Department of Finance publish a set of accrual numbers for the Commonwealth and the Treasury publish another set of cash numbers for the Commonwealth, and the public trying to understand why the numbers do not add up, is clearly one to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report on financial reporting for the Commonwealth, the committee recommends that budget appropriations, forward estimates and the budget process itself should move into the accrual accounting environment by the year 2000. In the committee's view, it is important that the parliament play a key role in determining the form and content of financial reports tabled. After all, such reports are prepared principally for parliament's use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Accordingly, the committee also recommends that the government introduce legislation to be called the fiscal reporting act in which parliament can determine the type of fiscal reports to be presented by governments. A fiscal reporting act, as envisaged by the committee in this report, would formalise the tabling of the budget papers, the Treasurer's mid-year review and the actual budget outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends the preparation of two additional budget cycle reports: firstly, a pre-budget fiscal strategy statement to be tabled three months prior to the budget and, secondly, a user-friendly condensed version of the budget papers that would be easily understood by the general public. But, more importantly, the fiscal reporting act would be the vehicle by which the parliament could require the budget cycle reports to be prepared as accrual based whole of government reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also examined the possibility of enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of the Commonwealth financial reports. At the moment parliamentary committees examine the financial performance of government departments and agencies, but not the Commonwealth as a whole. The committee recommends that whole of government reports produced by the Department of Finance should stand referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The committee also recommends that budget papers should stand referred to a parliamentary committee to be established for the purpose under the proposed fiscal reporting act. By heeding the recommendations in this report, the government has an opportunity to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of the international trend to accrual reporting for governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall now turn my attention to the second of the two reports being tabled by the committee today, namely, report 342, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The administration of specific purpose payments: a focus on outcomes</EMPHASIS>, which is the result of the committee's inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. A central feature of Australia's federal fiscal arrangements is the flow of Commonwealth financial assistance to state and local governments. Commonwealth financial assistance to the states is divided into two categories: specific purpose payments, SPPs, and general purpose payments, GPPs. In 1995-96, the Commonwealth paid out approximately $18.3 billion in accordance with the 90-odd SPP agreements between the Commonwealth and the state governments, local governments, universities and non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last decade reviews at the Commonwealth and state levels have highlighted considerable potential for improvements in the administration and structure of SPPs and the effectiveness and efficiency with which SPP funded services are delivered to the public. The weight of evidence prompted the JCPA to establish its own inquiry, which has culminated in this report. The JCPA made an early decision to confine its inquiry to the administration of SPPs and avoid entering into debate on the appropriate balance of SPPs and GPPs to the states or the merits of individual SPP objectives. These issues are matters of policy and are well canvassed at the regular Council of Australian Governments&mdash;better known as COAG&mdash;and Commonwealth-state ministerial meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite arguments to the contrary from some state governments, the committee believes that SPPs are a legitimate vehicle for ensuring that Commonwealth policies and priorities are implemented, even if this is done by complementing or topping up existing state government services. As such, the Commonwealth should have the primary responsibility for setting the broad policy and national objectives of SPPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The administration of specific purpose payments: a focus on outcomes</EMPHASIS>, the committee argues, however, that the Commonwealth should shift its focus from the micro-management of SPPs and leave state governments with greater responsibility for service delivery planning. The trade-off for granting the states greater autonomy in service delivery planning is that the Commonwealth will place a correspondingly greater emphasis on measuring service delivery performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee became concerned that too few SPP agreements clearly articulate what the SPPs are designed to achieve in terms of impact on the community. The result is often a continuing preoccupation with the activity associated with SPPs rather than with the results of the activity. The committee has recommended that all SPPs should have concise statements of what the SPP is trying to achieve, expressed in terms of measurable outcomes. Associated performance indicators should also be specified in the specific purpose payment agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Correspondingly, and importantly, state governments and other parties receiving SPP funds should be held accountable for their performance towards meeting program objectives, or what they achieve, rather than so much on how they achieve the objectives. However, the committee believes that input controls such as maintenance of effort clauses, match funding agreements and caps on the proportion of funds that can be spent on administration should not be phased out of SPP agreements before performance agreements are phased in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, most SPP agreements will need a more sophisticated framework of sanctions in place for non-compliance with the terms of SPP agreements before the Commonwealth can give responsibility for service delivery planning to states. Such sanctions might include a temporary return to a greater Commonwealth involvement in service delivery planning and oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the continuous collection and assessment of performance data should be the main way of measuring SPP performance, the committee believes it important for SPP administrators to be subject to external scrutiny by independent valuators. The Auditor-General is the Commonwealth's major external reviewer and has the mandate to conduct performance audits for public sector entities and programs. However, the mandate does not extend to allowing the Auditor-General to evaluate the performance of the state agencies also involved in administering SPPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Commonwealth Auditor-General has argued that Commonwealth auditors-general should be able to conduct holistic performance audits that follow the Commonwealth dollar through. Such audits would best be performed by Commonwealth and state auditors-general conducting the audits with joint teams. There is a practical difficulty, however, that not all state auditors-general have the same performance audit mandates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the ultimate goal should be uniform audit legislation in all Australian jurisdictions. A less ambitious but more achievable goal which the committee has recommended in its report on SPP administration is that all audit legislation be harmonised to allow auditors-general to conduct joint performance audits of SPPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term, the committee sees greater potential for coordinated audits between the Commonwealth Auditor-General and those state auditors-general who have a mandate to conduct performance audits. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General investigate the possibility of conducting coordinated performance audits of SPPs with state auditors-general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administration of special purpose payments: </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">a focus on outcomes</EMPHASIS>, the committee has recommended major changes in the way that the Commonwealth acquits the many hundreds of millions of dollars that it provides to the state governments, universities and non-government schools each year as part of SPP agreements. Let me state at the outset that the committee believes it is fundamental for the Commonwealth to be assured that SPP funds are spent on the basis on which they were allocated. However, the committee believes that it is possible to streamline SPP financial accountability mechanisms and still allow a full acquittal of SPP funds. In essence, the committee believes that the Commonwealth should be satisfied with the audited and appropriately annotated annual financial statements of SPP fund recipients for SPP acquittal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages of this model are numerous. The agency receiving SPP funding does not have to prepare separate accounts for the Commonwealth, the audit task is not duplicated and the Commonwealth can be assured that the statements will be prepared promptly. There will thus be a saving in time, effort and costs, and one set of documents that satisfy the financial accountability requirements of all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On a related matter, the committee has recommended that Commonwealth departments administering SPPs should liaise with the Department of Finance to determine whether SPP payments are being made on an optimal schedule and dates to minimise the Commonwealth's recourse to short-term borrowing. Such a recommendation has the potential to save the Commonwealth considerable sums of money, as badly timed transfers can place pressure on the Commonwealth's cash holdings and contribute to the need for short-term borrowings to cover any cash shortfalls. This recommendation complements recommendations made in an earlier report by the committee, report No. 340, concerning cash management in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee believes it is important that both the public and the service deliverers are aware of the Commonwealth's financial contribution to the delivery of SPP funded services. In the committee's experience, it is all too easy for the Commonwealth's contribution to joint Commonwealth-state programs to be ignored. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that all SPP agreements should include arrangements to ensure that the Commonwealth's contribution is recognised in application documentation, approval announcements, media releases, official openings and other program publicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges that implementation of some of its recommendations will not be easy, particularly for the large, ongoing SPPs in the health, education and community services areas. Reforms will be gradual, not just because of the difficulties in measuring outcomes and performance, but also because of the impossibility of quickly reorganising complex systems without service delivery suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the practical difficulties, it is important that the momentum for reform continues. The committee believes that its recommendations, if adopted, will ensure that the momentum is not lost and that SPP administration and accountability as a whole is improved. Most importantly, those individuals or groups in the community who receive SPP funded services, of whatever form, should receive more efficient and effective service, delivered in the most economical way possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I now turn to the third report being tabled by the committee today: report 343 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax law improvement: a watching brief</EMPHASIS>. In February this year I announced to the House that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts would be keeping a watching brief on the work of the tax law improvement project. This report is the first tabled as a result of that brief. The tax law improvement project is engaged in the task of completely rewriting Australia's income tax legislation. It is a task of national significance and one which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts supports. Indeed, the improvement project was established in response to one of the recommendations in the committee's report 326 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in parliament in November 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on tax law improvement contains the committee's comments on evidence taken at a public hearing held in October this year. At this hearing 17 witnesses from government, from tax and accounting bodies, and from academia were invited to give their views on a range of issues relating to tax law improvement. Our intention in presenting this report is not to call into question the work of the improvement project, much of which has been strongly supported in the parliament and in the wider community; rather, our interest is to ensure that the opportunities we now have to reform our tax law come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three main themes which emerged at our hearing and which are reflected in the report. These are: the scope of the terms of reference for the improvement project; the way in which the re-written law should be delivered to parliament and implemented; and the need for a separate forum to examine matters of tax policy. I would like to refer briefly to each of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the capacity of the improvement project to produce simplified tax law is limited by its inability to examine and proposed changes to tax policy. Since the beginning, its mandate has been to re-express, in simpler language, the law as it currently stands&mdash;not to review current tax policy. After weighing the evidence, the committee believes that the mandate of the improvement project is appropriate. To encumber the project with a broader responsibility at this stage would jeopardise the chances of producing better tax law within the sort of time frame set for the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main theme discussed at the hearing was the delivery schedule for the re-written legislation. The project team is proposing to deliver the new law to parliament progressively, as it is drafted, and to seek progressive implementation, with each instalment of the re-written law commencing for the income year beginning after royal assent. An alternative view, which has some currency within the tax industry, is that a deferred commencement date should be set for the re-written law at the completion of the project&mdash;the so-called `big bang' approach. There are valid arguments in favour of both approaches, but on balance the committee considers that progressive implementation of the re-written legislation is a better option than deferring commencement of the legislation until the conclusion of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final and most contentious issue emerging from the hearing was in relation to the need for a separate forum to consider tax policy issues. The evidence we received indicated widespread frustration in the tax and business communities about the way in which tax policy has evolved and is debated in Australia. This frustration generated a number of views about the need for an alternative tax policy forum, about how such a forum might be constituted, and about what such a forum might consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the committee is sympathetic to the concerns underpinning these views, in the end the committee does not support the calls for a new external forum for the development of tax policy. The development of tax policy is, and will always remain, a government's prerogative. The Treasury is rightly the focus of tax policy development in Australia. This is not to say that Treasury always gets it right, nor that tax policy should be determined in a vacuum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We received evidence which was strongly critical of the way in which Treasury deals with stakeholders in the tax system. It seems to the committee that Treasury could improve its performance in this area by adopting the sort of open and inclusive consultative processes used by the improvement project in its work. Even though we believe Treasury is the appropriate body to convene and direct any consideration of the strategic direction of tax policy, there is a legitimate role for parliament to play in ensuring that issues emerging from the work of the improvement project are given close consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end the committee intends to continue its watching brief in the area of tax law improvement. While I expect that most tax policy matters emerging from the improvement project would, in the normal course of events, be taken up by Treasury and the ATO, the committee will follow up any significant matters which appear not to be receiving appropriate attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, opportunities for reform are rare and it is important that the momentum for change initiated by the establishment of the improvement project be not only maintained, but built upon. The improvement project shows every sign of achieving the objectives set for it. This is to the great credit of all involved in the project. I would like to particularly acknowledge the efforts of the project director, Brian Nolan, who is performing a difficult job with distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the committee agrees with those who have argued that the improvement project should be seen as the first step in a more ambitious reform of the tax law. Ultimately, a tax simplification program must focus on more than re-writing the tax act; it must be seen to review tax policy and simplify both the full body of tax law and the administrative systems underpinning the law. This broader goal is the challenge which will confront governments over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe that the recommendations in these three reports, if adopted, will contribute significantly to the better administration and accountability of the Commonwealth public sector. A number of individuals and public and private organisations, internationally and at the Commonwealth, state and local levels, have provided written and oral evidence to the inquiries that have culminated in these three reports. I would like to express my thanks, on behalf of the committee, to all those who have offered their assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat, including our secretary Grant Harrison, and the secretaries of our respective subcommittees: Susan Johnston, John Carter and James Catchpole.

I refer to Laraine Brennan, Laura Gillies and Yolanda Rao. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for the opportunity to table these reports today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I, along with the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, commend the recommendations contained in these three reports to the House. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, over the life of this parliament, has been extremely busy in looking at a number of different areas of the operations and financial activities of the Commonwealth, the collection of Commonwealth revenue and, more particularly, the expenditure of and accounting for the expenditure of that Commonwealth revenue. The reports that we are tabling today are certainly a very important part of that series of inquiries that have been undertaken by the JCPA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 341, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability</EMPHASIS>, looks at a couple of elements of government activity and operation in looking after the finances of the Commonwealth. The first element is that aspect of whole of government reporting which flows on from the report we did on accrual accounting and accrual reporting, moving the way the Commonwealth operates in that area up into the 1990s along with the private sector. We have moved in that direction as far as the commercialisation aspect of GBEs is concerned, but it is time the Commonwealth now looked at a much better accounting and reporting practice for all its agencies. Certainly there are some very important recommendations about that contained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of this report refers to fiscal responsibility legislation and the whole fiscal responsibility area. It all revolves around the words `transparency and accountability'. It is important to note that recommendation 1 in this report is about getting the government to commit itself to the preparation of audited whole of government reports beginning with the 1997-98 financial year. To achieve that target, the report recommends that the government undertake a number of different activities in a number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the government take note of these reports. We have consulted very widely in these activities both within and outside Australia on the best accounting and reporting procedures that the Commonwealth can undertake, with the notion in mind that the broader population of Australia should be able to understand exactly where we stand, what is being done and where we are going in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important part of that process and the process of moving towards accrual accounting is the way that we value the assets of the Commonwealth. We struggled with this a little bit and a lot of people gave very different advice on the way the government should value those assets, but certainly it is an integral part of the accrual accounting process. Recommendation 5 is fairly lengthy and has regard to the valuation of Commonwealth assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report, recommendations 12, 13, 14 and 15 revolve around the recommendation to implement a fiscal reporting act. Recommendation 12 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should prepare and introduce into Parliament legislation to establish a fiscal reporting framework binding on Commonwealth governments, such legislation to be called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fiscal Reporting Act</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say in recommendation 13:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fiscal Reporting Act</EMPHASIS> should require:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)that fiscal reports be prepared in the form of the whole of government reports on an accrual basis: and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)that the form and content of fiscal reports for the Commonwealth accord with the Committee's recommendations in Chapter 2 of this report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, whole-of-government reporting. Recommendation 14 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fiscal Reporting Act</EMPHASIS> should require:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)that the Commonwealth adopt accrual budgeting following the tabling of the first audited whole of government reports for the Commonwealth; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)that the first accrual budget for the Commonwealth be introduced into Parliament for the 1999-2000 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then recommendation 15:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fiscal Reporting Act</EMPHASIS> should require the tabling or publication of fiscal reports of specified format, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)that an agreed set of indicators of the government's financial performance&mdash;including net debt as a proportion of GDP&mdash;be specified in the legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)that governments be required to report against these indicators their achievements and future policies in each report required under the legislation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)that fiscal reports incorporate estimates for the budget year and the following four years of all major fiscal variables (such as net debt);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)that the fiscal reports specify the macroeconomic assumptions on which estimates are based;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)that fiscal reports incorporate forecasts or projections for the budget year and the following four years of all appropriate economic indicators on which fiscal estimates are based;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)that fiscal reports contain a statement of sensitivity of fiscal estimates to economic conditions; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)that the format and content of the fiscal reports prepared under this Act remain constant over time to allow historical comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is the most salient point in that whole recommendation. We have to give the broader community in the Commonwealth the opportunity to be able to compare on the same set of internationally accepted standards within the fiscal reporting structure under this proposed `Fiscal Reporting Act' the performance of an incumbent government to the performance of previous governments. Too often we see in political debate today the flexing of figures, the flexing of statistics, to suit the purpose of the government of the day. The people of Australia need to know exactly where the Commonwealth stands financially and need to be able to understand how a government of the day is actually performing on a set of benchmarks that can be used for successive governments. The people of Australia and commentators on economic performance need to be able to easily compare the performance of a government with that of the governments that preceded it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 341 is a very important report to come before this parliament. I urge the government to be cognisant of the recommendations in that report, to look at the drafting of the proposed `Fiscal Reporting Act' and to move towards the dates that have been recommended to try to achieve whole of government reporting. We have highlighted in this place under a previous report evidence that was taken by a number of representatives from the bureaucracy, Treasury and Finance regarding their willingness to drag their feet on the issue of accrual accounting. It is incumbent upon the government to crack the whip in that area to ensure that those dates are met. It is important that we get up to that level if we are to remain credible as financial managers, whoever is in government, to the Commonwealth, the people of Australia and the other nations that we are dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to report 342, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The administration of specific purpose payments: a focus on outcomes.</EMPHASIS> That is exactly what this report is all about&mdash;a focus on outcomes. Too often during the inquiries that were undertaken and in evidence we took it became apparent that the focus was not on outcomes but on inputs and outputs&mdash;that is, a tick was given by the bureaucracy, `Yes, we will receive the money,' and a tick was given when the money was spent and that was the end of the issue. Not enough emphasis was put on the outcomes and whether the goals that were set right at the start when the SPP was raised and drafted and put into place were achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these recommendations are followed through by the government. I noticed that in the chairman's tabling speech he referred to a recommendation concerning performance audits. At the moment there are no performance audits. The best way to check on the delivery of outcomes from SPPs is if there is some arrangement between the Commonwealth Auditor-General and the state auditors-general to audit  performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to do a financial audit&mdash;it involves just confirming that the money is being spent in a particular area&mdash;but it is a different story for the Auditor-General to say that the government's objectives with this SPP have been achieved. That is not the case now, and recommendation 13 highlights it. It is important that the government take that on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note at the start that, in the 1995-96 budget, total gross payments by the Commonwealth as SPPs were estimated to be $34.2 billion. That is 28 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays. That is a very large slice of the Commonwealth budget. So it is important that a focus be placed on those outcomes. That is one area that the government needs to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 11 highlights the need for incentives and sanctions for achieving those outcomes. Recommendation 13 highlights the need for performance audits. Recommendation 19 focuses on SPPs that go through the states to other service deliveries. The most efficient SPP was the local capital works program at the end of 1992. The administration costs of that SPP to the money outlaid by the Commonwealth was about 0.6 per cent, which makes it the most efficient and effective SPP that we have seen. That was only mailboxed through the states because of the constitutional arrangements. We probably need to see a greater focus on those type of SPPs. The worst that could be instanced is the HACC program, where almost 19 per cent of the allocated amount of money going from the Commonwealth is absorbed in administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is more than up on this matter. I know that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) will labour this point, but I want to flag it as well: Commonwealth involvement in SPP funded projects undertaken by the states is not often enough acknowledged by the states. Two major road work activities have been undertaken in my electorate under the black spots program. One is the Possum Brush deviation and the other is the Heron's Creek deviation. In neither of those cases was the Commonwealth recognised nearly enough. In both those cases, it was all Commonwealth money, but the states took the kudos. The states did the opening, and the Commonwealth was put well and truly in the background. In the Possum Brush deviation, not one representative from the government, the opposition or even the bureaucracy was involved. They were all state RTA people and state members. I hasten to add that that was under a coalition government at the time. I know that the member for Charlton will have more to say on that issue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 341 follows closely the tabling of report No. 338, which was concerned with accrual reporting and accounting in Commonwealth agencies. The consideration that was given in report No. 338 and now in report No. 341 represents, in effect, a continuum of a series of related initiatives that have been recommended by the Public Accounts Committee. All of those initiatives are directed towards what should be our primary goal of improving public sector efficiency, transparency and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public sector accountability will no longer focus almost exclusively on spending limits and on cash based reporting. Increasingly, the focus will shift to accountability for outputs and outcomes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 341, which has been tabled today, is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting for the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>. The core recommendation of that report is that the accrual reports of government agencies, including government business enterprises, should be consolidated into an accrual based whole of government report for the Commonwealth. Whole of government reports will give a picture not only of the government's revenue and expenditure but also of its assets, liabilities and resulting financial position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have attempted to reach a sensible compromise with, say, the effort&mdash;and in some cases it is quite an absurd effort&mdash;that is made by some states in the United States and other jurisdictions overseas in pursuing what is commonly referred to as fiscal responsibility. I believe this present government since 1983 has been fiscally responsible. The record stands for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have suggested some very important provisions in this report in connection with this move towards accrual accounting. The committee believes, and I strongly endorse this suggestion, that in the process of a government increasingly adopting an accrual accounting approach it should also extend that to an accrual based budget. A lot of nonsense is spoken about that bottom line, that deficit which to a very large extent means nothing. I have made the observation on previous occasions that in most budgets since the Second World War we have not had a recurrent deficit. The deficit often resulted from capital investment that government sensibly should undertake. On that basis, it lacks any significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These quite absurd attempts that are made by some states in the United states and elsewhere overseas, including some aspects of the New Zealand legislation, to achieve what is referred to as fiscal responsibility often give rise to what is also called creative accounting. So those budgets can be manipulated in order to bring about the outcome required in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report very positively. It is a very sensible report, and I have indicated that I commend all the recommendations.

The chairman referred to the fact that in excess of 50 per cent of the total funds that are made available by the Commonwealth to the states for various purposes are in the form of these specific purpose payments. We know that for decades they have been a traditional source of conflict, tension, misunderstanding, dispute and duplication between the Commonwealth and state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a legitimate acceptance on the part of the Commonwealth that if the Commonwealth raises the funds&mdash;that is, if we take the dollars out of taxpayers' pockets&mdash;we have a responsibility not only to apply those to a large extent according to Commonwealth priorities but also to make sure they are being correctly spent. Of course, the states often see the Commonwealth intruding into areas which they believe to be exclusively theirs. We dispute that. I believe that it is an appropriate area for the Commonwealth to be involved in. </PARA>

Some of them are quite absurd and petty, even to the point of vindictiveness against the Commonwealth because the funds are provided by the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth has certain expectations of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyne referred to road openings and road projects where all the national taxpayers' dollars are provided to the states for those projects to be undertaken.

I think that reflects very poorly on them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the committee quite correctly said that we will not retreat from some of those other precautionary procedures we have adopted, and which are inherent in the funding of those programs, until we are satisfied that those performance based indicators are appropriate.

This is a very sensible exercise. I know some reservations have been expressed, but generally we have endorsed the approach which has been taken. We believe it should be continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue related to the results of the tax law rewriting exercise. That is really what it is. It is not improving tax legislation; it is improving the way in which that tax law is expressed. Another point was whether, in rewriting that tax law, it should be introduced piece by piece or whether you should hold the lot and introduce it in toto at the end. We came down on the side of endorsing the approach which I am sure was being sought by Brian Nolan, and the Assistant Treasurer, that it be introduced piece by piece so that people have a chance to absorb it, adapt to it and accommodate it, rather than hitting them with a big rewriting of the tax law. I think the chairman suggests that that might amount to hitting them between the eyes with a big rewriting of the tax law in toto at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question we had to address was whether the rewriting exercise should include restatements of and changes to the tax law. We said, `No, it should not. The purpose of this exercise is to simplify the way in which that law is expressed, to restate the law as it is, and then to clearly identify in subsequent legislation as is necessary any amending legislation to tax law, to tax policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also acknowledged in that context that if, in the process of rewriting the law, there are occasions where some minor modification is necessarily inherent in that rewriting, then that should be identified in the explanatory memorandum so that we know exactly where those modifications are. If there are any more significant changes which inadvertently intrude into the rewriting of the legislation, it is the  responsibility of this parliament and the wider community to identify them and seek to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue to be resolved related to whether the improvement or reform project process should be continued through the creation of a comprehensive forum to advise on tax policy. The chairman of the committee has indicated that we said it should not. It is appropriate that the government of the day have the prerogative for the development of tax policies and legislation, but with the guidance, coordination, assistance and advice of Treasury. That is not something which any government should abrogate and leave to some type of external agency or group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth issue the committee gave consideration to was whether a possible role for a parliamentary committee was the consideration of emerging tax policy issues. Although that issue was flagged by the committee, the committee agreed not to pursue it vigorously at this stage but to monitor any developments. I know that the chairman referred to that point as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth issue we gave considerable consideration to was the question of for whom tax legislation should be written. I am a taxpayer. I do not read tax legislation very much, so I do not know that rewriting it and making it simpler would be of much value to me. The question was whether we should rewrite the legislation for people in the community who pay tax, or should we not rewrite it because we know that the professionals in the industry are the only people who read it? I read the brochures and the advisory stuff that George Gear sends out to me; but do not send me the tax act, George, because I do not go through that in detail. That is not a part of my late night reading at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accepted that the government does have the responsibility to make legislation readable and understandable to those people who are constrained in any way by it or who are under any sort of obligation or requirement as a result of it. It is a question of getting a sensible balance. I believe that the approach Brian Nolan is taking to that is the appropriate one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that we had to consider was whether or not the rulings and determinations of the Australian Taxation Office should be incorporated into the rewriting of the legislation. We said that, in general, that should not be done, because in effect it would be saying that we would rewrite the tax law in terms of the interpretations the tax office had put on existing legislation, and we said that that was not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Brian Nolan has now indicated that there will be some incorporation of rulings and determinations in the capital gains tax. The committee will seek advice from Mr Nolan in connection with that, because that appears to be at variance with the approach that he has adopted and that we have endorsed. We will determine our position in light of that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise to my colleague the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), who is to follow me in this debate, but these were matters that I wanted to raise. I commend these reports and the recommendations to the government, and I commend the content of the reports to anybody who is interested in these issues. I found the exercise involving these reports&mdash;under the chairmanship of our excellent chairman, Les Scott&mdash;to be very satisfying. I endorse Les's comments about the secretariat as well&mdash;they are competent, qualified, professional people. Without them, these reports simply would not be written. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to speak briefly on the reports that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has tabled. Because time is short, I will confine my comments to report No. 342, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The administration of specific purpose payments: A focus on outcomes</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three years that I have been here, the one issue which has continued to cause frustration across a whole range of policy areas&mdash;in terms of the implementation of government policies, particularly social policies&mdash;is the ongoing difficulties inherent in our federal system and constitution and the resultant difficulties with Commonwealth-state relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Federation was adopted in 1901, the states still retained power in most policy and administration areas. In 1901, the powers of the new Commonwealth of Australia were limited to areas such as defence, foreign affairs and immigration. It was not until after the Second World War that the Commonwealth adopted primary responsibility for taxation. So the states still ran most policy areas&mdash;certainly areas such as health, education, housing, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 96 the Commonwealth does have financial powers, as it largely controls purse strings. By the time the Whitlam government was elected, it was found that the states did not have a tremendous track record, especially in some of the areas of social policy, such as mental health or Aboriginal health. The Commonwealth, and certainly the new Whitlam government, felt that we had to do more to show leadership as a national government. That was when the SPP, specific purpose payments, became more prevalent. As the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) pointed out, ever since the 1970s, about 50 per cent of Commonwealth grants to the state have been in the form of specific purpose payments, and I believe that that is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talked to the states during the hearings in this inquiry, they had a different view. Understandably, they would like us to hand over all the money through untied grants and not even have a say in how the money is spent, even though it is Commonwealth money in the sense of being taxpayers' money. We have a different view here. As one of my colleagues said during the drafting of the report, `Why should we trust state governments? You cannot.' I guess that is a frustration that a lot of us share, but the reality is that states have constitutional power and occasionally people in state governments want to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report process has been useful. We have had a thorough look at the way the SPPs operate. They are not perfect, and we have come up with a lot of evidence that the administration of them is less than wonderful. As an example I refer to recommendations 1 and 2. Recommendation 1 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth departments should ensure that all SPP agreements include an explicit statement of the roles and responsibilities of each party to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth departments should ensure that each SPP agreement clearly indicates the arrangements for consultation between the parties to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>On reading that, most people would shake their head and ask why that was not always the case. The reality is that we found in the inquiry that many of the agreements did not have those straightforward processes in them. We have recommended what the title to the report suggests: a focus on outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very useful exercise to examine the role of the Commonwealth and the states in the implementation and the administration of SPPs. The SPPs need to be reformed and reviewed so that governments at all levels focus on outcomes, particularly in those very important social policy areas. While the Commonwealth has a responsibility to monitor the states, to ensure that the money is spent in the policy areas and that the money reaches the areas targeted by the programs, state governments are in a good position to run the programs on a day-to-day basis and to ensure service delivery. That is the report in a nutshell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comprehensive and worthwhile report has been a particularly important undertaking by the Public Accounts Committee, which does a lot of important work, as we all know. There has been no more frustrating area in politics in Australia in recent years than Commonwealth-state relations, about which there was a big debate in 1991, leading to the setting up of a Special Premiers Conference in November, which never happened, as I recall, because the states boycotted it. There was a lot of debate in the community at the time, which I remember quite well, although I was viewing it from an industrial point of view. Nevertheless, we have never really come to grips with the difficulties in relations between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report will not change the constitution. It will not tell state governments how to run their business but if, in any small way, this report can assist in bringing about a more efficient and rational approach to specific purpose payments while nevertheless maintaining the integrity and the need for those specific purpose payments, then the report will have been well worth while. I commend the report and endorse the comments of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) about states, particularly the issue of recognition of the Commonwealth's role in some of the openings and some of the things that happen that I have experienced as well. I endorse the comments of the other speakers, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the chairman, the member for Oxley. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

In so doing I would like to give the House, and perhaps the rest of Australia, an example of how my community has been touched by the program's success, and most particularly the commitment it has had from the community as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 months we have all enjoyed commemorating the momentous events of 50 years ago. In our newspapers and magazines, on our televisions and radios, the struggle and sacrifice of Australian men and women have been brought home to us once more, back into our national consciousness where it belongs. The Australian people have shown that the events of 1939 to 1945 and our role in that war are still very important within our hearts. Just as the futility and the heroism of Gallipoli and the sacrifices of World War I have long since ingrained themselves into our collective memories, so too have the deeds of Australians who participated in all areas of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, while all Australians have looked on with pride as the events of the last year have unfolded, it is now time that we stood back as a government and asked, `Did we do enough to involve all Australians in the commemorations? Were we successful in our campaign?' I do not believe we want these 12 months to have passed and find that our celebrations have featured all of the pomp, ceremony and pageantry that we could muster, all of the famous faces and all the grand words, but that the people of our local communities had sat back in their armchairs or around their kitchen tables and thought, `I wonder what happened where I live; I wonder what happened in my community?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, the great success of the government's Australia Remembers campaign is that it was not solely the domain of politicians and dignitaries paying lip-service to the deeds of our fellow citizens and it was not purely about remembrance events in our national and state capitals. It has been and is about generating remembrance and commemoration in our own communities&mdash;in our RSL clubs, schools, sporting clubs and local associations and involving our own businesses. The basic strength about Australia Remembers is that it gives ordinary Australians a chance to express their feelings, their gratitude, in local events organised by local committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister outlined in his speech in February the level of commitment the government had displayed in organising Australia Remembers. It gives me great pleasure to report that all of the hard work&mdash;and I think at times all of the logistic nightmares&mdash;and all of the selfless volunteering have certainly paid off. Australians of all ages, backgrounds and beliefs have been involved in some fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Prospect, like so many other areas around Australia, people threw themselves wholeheartedly behind the Australia Remembers campaign with a great strength of purpose. We all desired to see that our veterans of World War II and other contributors to the war effort received the thanks and the respect they deserved. Australia Remembers focused our community, and I am happy to report that we have more than risen to the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would at this juncture like to place on record my sincere appreciation to the members of my committee who worked so keenly over 12 months: Bruce Short, the president of the Fairfield sub-branch and Fairfield RSL Club, accompanied by his committeemen John Burgess and Jim Crossan and secretary-manager of that club, Terry Buck; Jack McCosker, the president of the Smithfield RSL sub-branch; and Ken Thomson and Fred Taylor from that sub-branch. We formed the Australia Remembers committee in Prospect in October 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first tasks we set ourselves in my area was to build two eternal flames. We wanted to have one constructed at the Fairfield RSL and the other in the memorial park, directly opposite the Smithfield RSL. In March, on behalf of the Australia Remembers Task Force, I presented two cheques of $10,000 each to the Fairfield and Smithfield RSL sub-branches to assist them in the building of the flames. It provided only a very small amount of assistance because the clubs became very committed financially to making sure those projects came to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People asked, `Why did you use the eternal flame?' The concept of the eternal flame is described by the Australian War Memorial as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By burning in perpetuity, the flame parallels a nation's never ending gratitude to, and remembrance of, its war dead, and the never ending value it places on freedom.</PARA>
<PARA>Our community wanted two eternal flames to commemorate those words; two eternal flames to commemorate the actions and deeds of so many valiant men and women. We had never before had such a thing constructed within the city of Fairfield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to say that the Prospect electorate will now have two flames, where previously, as I have stated, there were none: two flames to remember the men and women from our area who died to keep this country free; two flames to remember those who fought and came back or who worked tirelessly in the war effort; and two flames for the people whom we now share fences with, shop with and work with. I had the privilege of unveiling the first flame at the Fairfield RSL on 15 August. I unveiled the second in the Smithfield RSL memorial gardens on 11 November, Remembrance Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Minister Sciacca discussed the government's blueprint for the commemorative year, one of the main problems he focused on was how little our schoolchildren knew of the threat facing Australia some 50 years ago. He hastened to point out that that was not a criticism of our children, nor was it a criticism of the education system. Our children needed to be reminded of the sacrifices, the fears, the hopes and the dreams of other young people, not much older than themselves, who embarked on a voyage to fight for Australia in the world's most frightening conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, one thing which the minister did not mention, but which was also of importance to the government during the planning stages of the program, was the need to make new Australians aware that the reason why Australia still enjoys such a robust and flourishing democracy is as a result of the action of their fellow citizens some 50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With one particular event in the Prospect electorate we were able to bring both of these separate groups of Australians together and to provide a stunning example of how well we have done as a nation. As many would know, the Prospect electorate has a young and growing population. It is growing because of the large number of migrants who have decided to settle in that area and make it their home. We decided that the best way to unite an entire community was to hold an essay competition, aimed at our schoolchildren and, by gaining their contribution, we would naturally capture the interest of their parents, many of whom are of ethnic origin, and local businesses which would sponsor&mdash;and did sponsor so generously&mdash;that enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The children were asked to write on the topic of why Australia should remember the end of World War II. We received hundreds of entries from the majority of schools&mdash;private and public, primary and secondary&mdash;within my area. Entries were judged by the Quota Club of Fairfield. Following a civic reception of some 250 people, provided through the generosity of Fairfield City Council, the winners were announced, congratulated and awarded their many prizes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that the entries did not just come as a result of pressure from teachers or parents. The competition was not part of the curriculum. Participation was not mandatory. Yet the hundreds of entries we received were certainly encouraging. These children wanted to be heard. Obviously, remembering wartime Australia and its people was very important to the younger generation and they were very keen to show it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition proved to be a remarkable success, not only because of the number of entries and the interest it generated in the community or because many local business people stepped forward to offer prizes for the winners, but because of the standard of the entries and the opportunity it provided for our young people to express how they felt about Australia's role in the Second World War. It crystallised their emotions and resulted in some extremely tender and thoughtful responses of which we can certainly all be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I judge it a success on yet another level: many of the entries came from schoolchildren of ethnic backgrounds&mdash;Vietnamese-Australians, Croatian-Australians, Italian-Australians and so many more. All submitted entries and all gave reasons why we, as a country, should remember the end of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I judge it a success on another level. So many of the entries came from school children of ethnic backgrounds&mdash;Vietnamese Australians, Croatian Australians, Italian Australians and so many more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a few extracts from some of the winning entries from those students. One was Sylvia Spagnola, a 6th grade student from St Gertrude's Primary School. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My grandfather fought in the war. He survived. The war was so terrible and it hurt my grandfather. Not so much on the outside, but on the inside.</PARA>
<PARA>Sylvia's classmate, Susan Cirillo, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My opinion . . . is that we should remember World War II and any other war because Australians want freedom, respect and peace.</PARA>
<PARA>We have comments from two year 9 students who were winners in their category, Kiet Nguyen of Prairiewood High, and Melina Napoletana from Mary MacKillop College. Kiet wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia feared that they too would be invaded by Japan so they withdrew many of their troops in North Africa back to fight in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>And Melina:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Letters and diaries of the men and women from that period reflect an intense feeling of loneliness and longing for home.</PARA>
<PARA>Vesna Arbanas, who is a Croatian Australian girl from year 10 at Prairiewood High School, made this very poignant comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World War II changed Australia . . . Australians began to realise that our freedom had been taken for granted. Its importance was realised when it was almost taken away . . . by the war.</PARA>
<PARA>Irene Gabra, of year 10 from Mary MacKillop College, writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's easier to forget than to remember. Why let the pain live on? . . . because if Australians forget the end of World War II, then they forget a generation that lived&mdash;and died.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the winning student of year 12, Peter Tollens, from Westfields Sports High School, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World War II and its end must always be remembered . . . to pay homage to the millions of patriotic and self-sacrificing Australians involved and because of the powerful lessons it provides for modern life.</PARA>
<PARA>These were just a few of the essays that I could read&mdash;every one of them is moving. It is important to note that 12 months down the track we have achieved, among our kids and among our new citizens, an understanding of the price of victory and of the freedom that they themselves are now depended on to protect. These are objectives that have been central to the Australia Remembers program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to commend and congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his staff for their fantastic work, as well as all the numerous state and local organisations that have carried the Australia Remembers banner so successfully into all parts of our society. I hope that, by giving you just a very small glimpse of what we have been able to achieve in Prospect during the year, I have been able to convince the members of this House of a job so very well done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it could not have been achieved without the dedication and hard work of the volunteers who worked to make sure we had such a successful year. It was not an easy task to construct the flames. We had some technical difficulties as to where we could put gas lines. We had to seek the cooperation and assistance of the local council on more than one occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unveiling of the eternal flame at Smithfield on 11 November&mdash;just prior to the 11th hour&mdash;was something for all to observe. It was a moving ceremony. The hundreds who attended on that day will never forget, and that flame now sits there with pride. The memorial garden in Smithfield is unique in our city. It is dedicated to people who wish to have their ashes interred there. It was during my time as mayor that the Smithfield RSL approached me and asked if they could have that area as a garden dedicated to memory. It was within that garden that we built this sandstone flame. Their request gave me the motivation to get that committee up and going, to see all of the services recognised in that way; otherwise the Australia Remembers flame is something that I believe would never have come about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period we had discussed what we should do with the money that was given by the government, when the suggestion came forward from the Fairfield RSL, `We know it is going to cost us a lot more than that, but we want something that will live on. We want something that will be there, even after we have all gone.' The Fairfield flame is constructed in the centre of their club, as you walk in through their front door. It is magnificent granite and glass. The flame burns there in perpetuity, in honour of so many wonderful service men and women who not only are members of the club, but who also enlisted from that district. Through that wonderful committee we have achieved what we set out to do. We set out to honour and commemorate the Australia Remembers program but, most particularly, we made sure that we left a memory for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I place on record my sincere appreciation and my congratulations to the community for a job well done. I thank all of those, too numerous to thank, who got involved in projects such as this. For example, the Quota Club women just came forward and said, `We'd like to be involved and be able to help you. We will judge the essays.' These were things that people did. They did not have to be pressured into it, they just volunteered. I put on record my congratulations to them all and I thank them for their assistance. I particularly thank the minister for providing an opportunity to an electorate like mine which enabled us to participate in such a wonderful program. </PARA>

I am pleased to say that there has been a bipartisan approach to the program. The coalition has fully supported it and the program has had my total support during this year. The program's other objectives were to encourage all Australians to remember and to thank the veterans who fought in the World War II campaigns, to recognise and appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of the widows and children of those veterans who did not return or who died in the intervening years, to encourage all Australians to remember and thank all who remained at home and kept the home front running, to recreate a sense of relief and excitement which marked the end of the war in 1945, and to educate the nation about the horrors and impact of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity in the parliament today to thank all Australians involved for the magnificent contribution that they made to the war effort both overseas and in Australia, and I thank those who maintained the home front.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bendigo electorate responded magnificently to the Australia Remembers program, and a number of committees were formed. It was too difficult to organise one committee to cover such a large geographical area, so I enlisted the support of a large number of organisations, including the Campbells Creek RSL which held a memorial march, a concert and visits to local schools. The St Arnaud RSL had a reunion lunch and march. Mr Bruce Ruxton was in attendance as the guest speaker and gave a very compelling message on that day. </PARA>

They were supported by the Central Goldfields Shire and the chief commissioner of that shire, John Gault. A band concert, supper and a very moving concert were held at which I had the honour and privilege to be in attendance. There was also a commemoration ceremony and presentation of Australia Remembers certificates. I was assisted by the RSL president, its secretary and the commissioner of Central Goldfields. We had so many people respond in that area that we had to divide the presentation day into morning and afternoon segments. In all, we probably presented over 400 certificates.

I was assisted by Commissioner Mos Thompson, the Chief Commissioner of the Mount Alexander Shire. That was an occasion to remember, with almost 250 certificates being presented during that morning. It was a fitting recognition of the contribution that people of that Castlemaine area have made. </PARA>

The whole length of that parade was flanked by school groups, young Australians who are enjoying their freedom as a result of the contribution made in war by our service personnel. They lined the streets and waved their Australian flags. This victory parade and service was followed by a barbecue in Rosalind Park and was a magnificent way of recognising the contribution made by our Second World War personnel and in fact everyone who had made a contribution, whether it was overseas or at home. The Bendigo committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Cliff Clohesy and with great assistance from Mr Alan Holmes and the secretary, Mr Jack Barnes, and all the other members, also put on two extremely good concerts to commemorate the Australia Remembers year. Those two concerts were very well attended. They were outstanding events and the public of Bendigo were very generous in their support.

It was an opportunity to do refurbishment and restoration work on a lot of the memorials and memorial halls, which probably would not have been able to have been done without that initiative and without that contribution. A number of halls and a number of memorials in my electorate have benefited as a result of that initiative. Those halls, which had to some extent been a little neglected, have been able to be refurbished and given a new lease of life.

Therefore, it was the responsibility of the committee which I was privileged to bring together to determine how those limited funds would be applied. Of course, there were disappointments but there was no ill-will on the part of any of those individuals, organisations or interests that did not get funded.

We think those results remain quite ambiguous in terms of the expectations that were first outlined as to the results that might be achieved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to speak to this amendment and other amendments that were considered, in a cognate way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, in the context of the extended deeming arrangements, to understand what we are doing here. This legislation resulted from the government's efforts to implement a system whereby any increase in the capital value of assets held by pensioners or part pensioners might be taken into account for the purposes of the application of the income test that is applied to all pensioners, so that, if values of a managed investment or a share rose during a defined period, that could be deemed to be income. Nobody could ever reap a capital gain, but it was deemed to be income and their pensions were reduced accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure was exceedingly unpopular, as one might well imagine, with pensioners and part-pensioners alike. In the end, after an inquiry undertaken by a Mr Barber of Ageing Agendas, the government came to the view that it needed to repeal that measure. But it did not want to do so without obtaining the benefit of additional savings for the government, in terms of expenditure. So it moved, in relation to the income testing regime, to deem that people would obtain a certain level of return on financial assets whether they got that return or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extended deeming arrangements envisage a five per cent or a seven per cent return depending upon the value of financial assets that a pensioner or part pensioner might have. It was in that context that we were having to look at the application of this new system which the government said was going to deliver certainty to pensioners and part pensioners. That is why we have had to turn our mind to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, if we were to oppose the government's extended deeming arrangements, we would have been seen as stopping the repeal of the unrealised capital gains measure. So, in a sense, even though we have quite significant doubts given the large number of people who will see their pensions reduced or who are likely to lose the benefit of fringe concessions that they now have&mdash;and the government admits that some 207,000 people are likely to be affected by this measure&mdash;our view has been that the government's legislation has to be reluctantly supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was deficient, nevertheless, in a number of important respects. The first area in which the legislation was deficient was that there was no indication as to the way in which financial assets were going to be valued. The government told us that there were existing administrative arrangements which they would continue, and they also indicated that they were going to consult, as the parliamentary secretary outlined in his speech. But it was clear that there were a number of important aspects of the administrative system that is now in place that the government relied upon, and it seemed to me that, if they were part of the system, the government ought not to object to them being outlined in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of valuation is important because, if pensioners or part pensioners see an increase in the value of their shares, other managed investments or other forms of securities that they might have, that increase in value could lead to a higher deeming rate outcome. The reality of a situation in which there might be a reduction in the value of assets that they have might also be important. In fact, it may determine whether they are eligible for a part pension at all and could determine whether or not they are entitled to eligibility for fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government assured us that if, of course, there had been a reduction in the value of people's assets, they could in fact request a revaluation at any time if they were so adversely affected. But there was nothing in legislation to give a guarantee that that would occur. The government told us it would occur, but there was no guarantee. I must say&mdash;and I want to thank the minister and the parliamentary secretary for at least being prepared to enter into some dialogue in relation to the implementation of a valuation regime and for proposing these particular amendments to give effect to what was proposed&mdash;that a number of factors have been taken into account. Valuations will occur six-monthly. The valuations are to occur at the time when pensions would normally be adjusted in accordance with the CPI. So the dates of 20 March in each calendar year after July 1996 and 20 September in each calendar year after 1996 were specified as being the dates for valuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the clause also is worded to allow a revaluation to occur when the person requests a revaluation of one or more of the person's listed securities or managed investments. Of course, the amendment also accommodates a situation in which the government might give a person a notice requiring them to give the government some advice as to their asset situation, and that seemed to be an appropriate arrangement to also continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the proposal does address the important issue of determining regularity of revaluation, but also maintains in legislative form a capacity for a person to get a revaluation at a point in time when there may be a significant change in the values of their listed securities or managed investments. So the measure is certainly one worthy of support. I am glad the government has proposed it. But as the parliamentary secretary's speech made clear, it was only at the insistence of the opposition parties that we were able to reach agreement to set out these matters in this comprehensive form providing the protection that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one other matter that I want to deal with is friendly society investments. Friendly society investment deposits are now to be the subject of the extended deeming arrangement. That will mean that certain forms of investment where tax is pre-paid will be deemed to produce a return which, because of the nature of the holdings and the tax pre-paid on it, will be very unlikely to reach the deemed return of five per cent or seven per cent. It is likely that, as a result of this change, many people who are investing in friendly societies will be re-assessing their investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did raise in the debate previously the concerns that we in the opposition had about this measure. It was referred to a Senate committee and the Senate committee came to the view that no change should be made to this legislation. They did so on the basis that many pensioners, particularly those who are not in the tax system, are not necessarily well served by maintaining investments in a form which provides for tax to be paid by the institution before it pays a dividend, which is what happens in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will mean that many friendly society depositors, particularly pensioners, will be re-assessing their position. I do not know what that will mean in the viability of friendly societies; there has not been a great deal of comment about that. I understand that some friendly societies are in a position to offer alternative forms of investment for their depositors where tax is not pre-paid, and there should be no difficulty there. I understand that others may be the subject of restrictions in offering alternative forms of investment to their depositors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly like the government to be on notice that this is a matter that we will be watching closely. I think the government needs to keep a very close watch on these matters, not just in the area of the Department of Social Security because it seems that perhaps this is not the area in which the matter needs to be addressed, but also on the issue generally if it has a concern about ensuring that organisations like friendly societies do have a sufficiently wide depositor base to maintain their viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a question that ought not to be dismissed lightly. It is a matter that will be of concern, particularly to those people who have over a long period of time had great confidence in friendly societies. While we have accommodated the government in relation to the legislation and not proposed amendments in this matter, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, because it would not have been appropriate to do so and the Senate committee has come to that view, it is obvious that there may be a requirement to keep a watching brief on this matter in other areas of Commonwealth legislation which do provide limitations on the way in which friendly societies are able to operate. </PARA>

<PARA>Millions of words have been devoted to World War II, of the rights and wrongs, of the suffering and of the great victories. But there must have been terrible personal and private tragedies. No-one who did not live through it can fully understand. However, it has been highly significant that my generation and those younger&mdash;school children in particular&mdash;have had the opportunity to hear first-hand from veterans and those close to them of their war experiences. Many experiences have been too painful to recall. Those who helped gather these stories and the memorabilia for displays and exhibitions have told me that veterans usually told the amusing stories and avoided the horror. No doubt this is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own parents were married during the war, and I am one of the baby boomers.

To be in the official party that day with Dame Roma Mitchell, the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, and others was a superb experience.

So that was terrific. After that there was the picnic in the park and dancing and big bands.

Many of them went on to comment how wonderful they thought it was that the children that I had written up in the same edition of that newsletter were protesting about the French nuclear testing.

One of the benefits has been the new work opportunities program. The minister has had the foresight to expand the program into activities where DEET could provide a subsidised work force as part of Australia Remembers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee was also able to sponsor the Campbelltown RSL Youth Club gymnasts who travelled to Berlin&mdash;the trip of a lifetime for those young people.

I should caution people&mdash;you would know this, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your experience on the punt&mdash;that they were not trotting races in the style of Harold Park. This was Menangle Park. They were clean run events. I did not get too many of the winners, but we all had a good time and benefited from the Australia Remembers sponsorship at the Menangle Park paceway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you can understand from the list of activities the full range of commemorative events that have been held in the city of Campbelltown. They have been for young people, old people and sporting people. For everyone in the community there has been an opportunity to pay tribute to the veterans who served in World War II and to join in the government's Australia Remembers initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that our program in Campbelltown has paid full tribute to the city's tremendous record of war service. Australia Remembers in Campbelltown has been a great reminder of and a great tribute to the city's vast contribution to Australia's war effort. Whenever the Australian nation has been called on to fight in defence of democracy and freedom, Campbelltown has been in the front line, from the army camps and recruitment centres at Ingleburn, Menangle Park&mdash;the site of the paceway these days&mdash;and the Campbelltown showground to VC winners like John Edmondson from Hurlstone and Kevin `Dasher' Wheatley in Vietnam, to the hundreds of enlisted personnel from the Boer War, both world wars, Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War. It really does underline the tremendous contribution that the City of Campbelltown and its citizens have made to all Australia's war efforts for over a century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote from the official history of Campbelltown in relation to the Second World War:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">War was declared on 3 September 1939. Once again a military camp was set up at the Campbelltown Showground. The first Machine Gun Regiment was training there when Billy Hughes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is fair to say one of the predecessors of the member for Berowra&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">visited in October 1939. Menangle Park Racecourse became a training ground for men of the 45th Battalion of the militia and later a base for the Air Force. Construction work at Ingleburn military camp continued around the clock in late 1939. Eschol Park was taken over to intern the staff of the German embassy.</PARA>
<PARA>Campbelltown's roll of honour records the names of 459 volunteers, 20 of whom were killed in action in World War II. The list of men included the Ingleburn Town Clerk, Harley Daley, Alderman Hosking and a former local federal member of parliament, perhaps remembered by some in this place, the former member for Macarthur, Jeff Bate. This reflected a tremendous community effort in which standing and social background were low order considerations. The war effort and defence of Australia were all important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have paid tribute to that contribution in Campbelltown through our Australia Remembers program. I believe we have done the contribution and the memory proud. We have remembered effectively throughout all parts of the city and among all generations in Campbelltown. That is due to the efforts of the people gathered in the public gallery here today. Again I pay tribute to them and also on their behalf I pass on our deep appreciation of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, who has supported all of our activities as much as any minister could be expected to support one part of the country. So well done, Con&mdash;a tremendous effort for what you have achieved with Australia Remembers and good on all the people in Campbelltown who have been part of our program, particularly those who have visited Parliament House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australia Remembers celebrations, the 50th anniversary celebrations of the ending of World War II, have been a great reminder to Australians of all ages of the marvellous contributions made by so many citizens of this nation so that Australia and the world could be free of the tyranny of Nazism and also Japanese hegemony in the Pacific. We can all be proud that the parliament has acted in such a bipartisan manner with these celebratory activities. In this regard I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, and the shadow minister, the member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, for their infectious enthusiasm and assistance in all our electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we all acknowledge that none of us would have enjoyed the freedoms and living standards we do today without that earlier sacrifice on our behalf. One cannot but help wonder, for example, what would have happened to our parliamentary system of democracy if the war had gone the other way. The Australia Remembers spirit that pervaded us all this year was captured in the official logo. We know that famous photograph with Ray Walsh on the front, a returning soldier from the war, held in the embrace of his wife and revered and loved by his children. Ray was born in Cowra in 1909 and died in Sydney in 1988. That meant a lot to me as my family knew the Walsh family and had contact with them in Cowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The celebrations had four purposes: to honour those who had died, to thank the remaining servicemen, to appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of those who became widows or the children who lost a parent and to acknowledge the role played by those who kept Australia running while the war went on mainly overseas. The purpose of the celebrations has been to involve all citizens in Australia, all sectors of the community, to include not only those who fought but those who made contributions and who remained behind in Australia while the war went on and also those who have been born since the war. It is vital that our children learn of the sacrifices made and learn of what happened so that they can take the memory forward, cherish the peace and maintain a proper defence vigilance to lessen the chances that we will ever have to go to war again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The celebrations commemorating these ideals have been held in many centres in my electorate, especially between August and the present day. Before I touch on them, I want to dwell for a moment on the sacrifice that was involved. In World War II, 993,000 Australians enlisted, which is a massive number for the population of that day; 27,000 were killed or died in prisoner of war camps; 23,500 were wounded; and, in total, 22,300 were prisoners of war. In today's dollars, it cost the nation $74,000 million, which is equivalent to about 30 per cent of national income. The civil work force at the time decreased by 40 per cent because of the war effort. We had a loss of export markets, particularly rural export markets. We had the severe rationing of food, clothing and fuel. That was all part of the sacrifice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Especially popular in the celebrations were the Australia Remembers certificates, which we have all handed out to those who made a contribution to the war effort. My office has spent hundreds of hours preparing hundreds and hundreds of these certificates to hand out. </PARA>

I still have some to go. The applications are still rolling in. We are still posting those certificates out and, in some cases, holding functions to present them in person. It has been a very worthwhile exercise. The families have been very appreciative of what has been done. Some people are laminating the certificates while others are framing them as a permanent record of what that family person contributed. They can then be handed down to later generations in the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Con Sciacca, gave $20,000 to each electorate to be spent on celebrations in one form or another. It was a more difficult and time consuming exercise to divide this up than I first envisaged, but it was a very rewarding effort indeed. I am very grateful to the committee who helped me with this. I actually had two committees, because my main office is in Dubbo and my other office is in Broken Hill, which is 800 kilometres away. One committee was run by Andy Dowd in Broken Hill, who did a magnificent job there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main committee in Dubbo was headed by Bert McLellan of the Dubbo RSL along with John Whittle from the Dubbo RSL. Keith Lowe from Bourke and Les Garth from the Orana Far West Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia pitched in, as did Keith Mulhall of the Parkes RSL. Elizabeth Smith from the Dubbo Regional Art Gallery and John Summers, the Principal of South Dubbo High School, also helped. I am very grateful to them for balancing all the competing interests and allocating the money appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just mention a couple of the functions that I was able to attend. At Bourke, there was an amazing gathering of people in the main street, including elderly people, all the school children and many citizens. I pay tribute to Keith Lowe and his magnificent committee for what they did there. The state president, Rusty Priest, unveiled the plaque. I will just read to the House the words on that plaque written by Keith Lowe:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This stone stands in tribute to all Australian men and women whose sacrifices contributed to peace at the end of the 1939-45 war. We honour the memory of those who gave their lives in defence of our country. We remember those whose lives were burdened by battle scars. We sympathise with families broken and wounded by death and injury on the battlefield. We renew our welcome to all new Australians who have sought refuge in our land from war and oppression. We acknowledge our debt to all the rural community, to those in industry and to all who loyally served on the home front. God bless them all, lest we forget.</PARA>
<PARA>Over 100 Australia Remembers certificates were handed out that day. The committee had the people who made the contribution all seated in alphabetical order in the main street. Everyone who was presented with a certificate had read out to the gathering some history of their individual contribution to the war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After lunch that day, we travelled to a very small village south of Bourke called Byrock. It does not consist of much more than a pub, a store and a school. It is a little town that is mentioned in Henry Lawson's stories. Perhaps, in its own way, that was the most moving ceremony of all. Again, a plaque was unveiled on a big rock there. David Creenaune, the publican, actually wrote the words that are on the plaque. If any members ever travel through that little village they should pull up and read them. The plaque says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In lasting memory of all who pioneered the outback regions of Australia then at the call of duty stood united as a nation at war. Their hardships and endeavours in remoteness and in battle are our foundations of mateship and freedom. Time shall never erase their determination and gallantry. Perpetual peace be forever with them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just a small example of what was done. There were other committees around the electorate. The Orana and Far West Vietnam Veterans' Association conducted tours and transport for diggers to the Newcastle area looking at army camps and other sites. The Warren RSL and shire council, with the help of Mayor Rex Wilson and RSL sub-branch President Doug Housler, had various activities in the town. I was pleased to be able to attend those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tullibigeal RSL committee refurbished the RSL building there. The Trundle RSL restored the Trundle Memorial Hall and held a victory dinner dance. The Trangie RSL sub-branch purchased books and a plaque. The Tottenham Welfare Council had a victory ball, and I was pleased to attend that. John Medcalf was the chairman of that ball, which went very well indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take my hat off to both Secretary Jack Burley and President Ron Bywater of the Nyngan RSL sub-branch for the work they have done there. They held a march, a dinner dance and other activities. The Narromine Shire Council, with RSL President Ray Harper and Secretary Terry Murray, put its money towards the restoration of the cenotaph in the main street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Menindee RSL sub-branch held commemorative services as well as a march, luncheon, memorabilia display and other activities. The Forbes 50th Anniversary Committee provided commemorative plaques to local schools and the council. The Eumungerie-Coboco RSL sub-branch had a family day, parade and victory ball. The Parkes RSL sub-branch held a commemorative service, dedicated new walks, presented medallions and held a luncheon, which I was able to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dubbo RSL sub-branch put together a magnificent photographic display suitable for touring the electorate. I was honoured to be asked to open that display. It also had a youth public speaking contest with prizes and a family barbecue in the park, which I also attended. As I have already said, the Bourke RSL sub-branch held its activities too. The Broken Hill RSL sub-branch had a photographic and historical display. It had school competitions and a picnic and parade. The Cobar Regional Museum erected a flagpole at the existing cenotaph and held school competitions and a `Diggers Ball'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, in my electorate of over 316,000 square kilometres and about 50 towns, there was a lot of activity throughout. Unfortunately, because a lot of it was packed into the one week in August, I could not attend every activity, but I have had contact with all the committees and what they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time remaining to me I just want to make some comment on the rewriting of history, if I could call it that, that was done at the time of VJ Day&mdash;or VP Day as it is more commonly known now. There has been a lot of debate in the community condemning the Americans for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is claimed that it was not necessary to drop the bomb because Japan was on its last legs and would have capitulated soon anyhow. I can understand the sympathies behind that attitude because there was a tremendous loss of life and a tremendous amount of suffering that went with it, but I do disagree with that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the dropping of those two bombs, as bad as it was, shortened the war remarkably. It saved lives overall. We must not forget that it also limited the Soviet Union, which invaded Manchuria on 8 August, between the time the two bombs were dropped, in their acquisition of territories in the area. We should never forget the horrendous suffering they inflicted on the territories they acquired in Eastern Europe, in countries such as Poland, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first bomb dropped from the plane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enola Gay</EMPHASIS> at 8.15 a.m. on 6 August 1945 over Hiroshima. It was dropped from 30,000 feet. In a minute it fell to 1,800 feet. A barometric pressure device activated a detonating mechanism. The first nuclear weapon in history used in warfare was a uranium bomb&mdash;`Little Boy'&mdash;of 13 kilotons. Hiroshima was destroyed in an instant through the heat, the blast and the fires that followed. Of the population of 343,000 people, 78,000 were killed at the time. Fifty-one thousand were injured or missing and 180,000 were made homeless. Of the 76,000 buildings in that city, 48,000 were destroyed and 22,000 were severely damaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Nagasaki three days later, a plutonium bomb, called `Fat Man', of 22 kilotons was dropped. Because of a navigational error, it was dropped off target and part of the city shielded by hills was spared the worst effects of the blast. Nevertheless, 35,000 at the time were killed. So a total in those cities of 113,000 were killed. Of course, later on many more people suffered radiation sickness&mdash;thousands of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that when the Americans were island hopping up to Japan to eventually invade Japan at Iwo Jima alone 26,000 people were killed. At Okinawa, 142,000 people were killed. One hundred and seventy thousand people were killed on those two islands alone&mdash;more than were killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is estimated that if the Americans had invaded Kyushu, the southern island alone, there would have been casualties of half a million to a million people inflicted before the war would have been brought to an end. I think we have to keep those things in mind and remember that the decision that had to be taken at the time was probably the correct one. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to bring to the attention of the House a couple of passages from a book that we produced entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Heroes at home and abroad 1939-45</EMPHASIS>. It had stories in it of local men and women who were abroad and those who worked on the home front, detailing what they did during the years 1939 to 1945. For example, there is the story of Perce Hosking, a well-known identity who died just recently. His story is quite relevant and points out to all what war was about and what happened during those years. It brought to the memory of those people exactly what they had gone through. Now we have a record of it. These are a couple of sentences from Perce Hosking's memory:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't talk about it much, over the years I've been quiet. But I'm now 74 and unless I put this on paper or say something about it . . . I think it's time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have thought about why I joined up. Was it patriotism, fear of the enemy? Was it expected of me? There was a whole group of feelings, emotions, reasons and expectations as to why any young serviceman joined up. It was probably my only way of going overseas.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The spirit to win is still there, in the young people today. There is a small proportion of people today who are not self motivated and don't succeed, but there are many young people who are doing a useful job, are skilled and getting behind each other to make a nation.

Once you go into the scoping study process, what you may have thought initially was your intention may be modified. It may not, but it may be modified on the basis of the decent advice that you get as you bring more and more people into the process of helping you conclude the way in which a sale ought to proceed. And it may make more sense, in terms of getting the best possible return for the taxpayer, to put the totality of the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank out rather than leaving an element overhanging the market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself is very significant because it demonstrates that between now and the year 2005 there will be 2.1 million jobs capable of being created in this economy and indicates where those jobs will be created. The report goes on to say that the five per cent objective by the year 2000 is achievable. It goes even further and says that we can get to four per cent unemployment by the year 2005. Importantly, it concludes that we have the labour market and skill formation policies in place to secure those targets and the objectives of getting unemployment down. It is the policy in this area that is also given regard to in a report published today by EPAC on investing in this economy. It says that policies in employment and training are essential to the nation's future growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is very interesting to note a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> today which, commenting on this report, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report vindicates the Federal Government's $11 billion four-year Working Nation policy which seeks to cut joblessness by subsidising jobs and stepping up training measures.</PARA>
<PARA>Who said that Working Nation was a failure? That side of the House. Who said that they would cut the programs? That side of the House. The very policies that are now recognised as significantly adding to the capacity of this nation to get its unemployment down, the opposition not only oppose, they would cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just the Working Nation programs that underpin this. It is the government's commitment to expanding the vocational education and training sector, where we have seen a 150 per cent increase in Commonwealth expenditure, some 200,000 additional places since 1990, as well as the massive expansion in the higher education sector. It is interesting that those on the other side of the House think it is a great win for the higher education sector to deny it extra resources, because that is what they have done in the Senate. They think it is a terrific contribution to the higher education sector to actually deny it money for extra places and extra infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the only part that the opposition falls down on in the commitment to employment and getting the unemployment rate down. In fact, the opposition has given up on being able to achieve the target of five per cent. It says it is unachievable&mdash;the same thing it said at the last election was unachievable in our jobs target of 500,000; yet we passed it six months ago. So they have given up on a target, they have given up on helping the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the same edition that the Leader of the Opposition has got up to disclaim, that in all the policy areas where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>'s reporters assess the opposition as having come out with something resembling a policy, there is not one mention in all of the areas of jobs, education or training&mdash;it is a blank.

That is consistent with the shadow Treasurer's objective of cutting the Working Nation programs. Their offer as an incentive to employers to take someone on is to cut the wages of that person. In other words, they want to blame the victim. They want to say it is the problem with the unemployed person that they are not being taken on. That cutting of wages is consistent with the Jobsback policy of last time which discounted wages based upon the length of time a person was out of work.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, because an enterprise bargaining employee receives an overall package at least as generous as they receive under the award, they are not disadvantaged, and neither are comparable employees who remain under the award circumstance. All of this is vitally important because it clearly establishes that there is only one real no disadvantage test&mdash;and that is the government's version.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means that the no disadvantage test being proposed by the opposition is simply not worth a cracker. That is because it is a test that will not be applied against the whole award but, as the member for Flinders has said, will be applied against an undefined set of minima.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You need to understand that in such a situation award employees would very quickly become uncompetitive. They would be effectively undercut in the marketplace. With time, they would find themselves forced into contracts or agreements that also undercut the award entitlements.

It is, of course, most important that unemployed people&mdash;particularly those who are disadvantaged in the labour market&mdash;are in a position to take advantage of this expansion in all work opportunities, including part-time and casual work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the honourable member's question, there has been a whole range of measures taken by this government to maximise the scope for that to occur. From July this year we have fundamentally restructured the social security income test that operates towards people receiving unemployment payments, so that it is possible to say that people invariably improve their circumstances by increasing their number of hours of work and overcoming some very severe disincentive traps which previously existed in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have introduced innovations such as the earnings credit, which is particularly useful for people receiving irregular amounts of part-time work. We have provided programs for sole parents through the jobs education and training program which are designed to increase their opportunities and scope to take up part-time work. We have introduced the disability reform program for those on disability pensions and so forth. There has been a whole raft of measures taken in addition to the mainstream efforts announced in Working Nation, the jobs compact and so forth, to maximise people's scope to take up work opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to inform the House that these efforts have had a high degree of demonstrable success over the past decade or so. I will quote a few figures to illustrate the point. If we take the proportion of unemployed people reporting earnings we see that it has increased from 3.7 per cent in 1983 to 21.7 per cent in August 1995. That is a huge increase. Sole parent pensioners reporting earnings increased from nine per cent in 1983 to 24.5 per cent in June 1995. The proportion receiving maintenance is up from 23.7 per cent in 1983 to 42 per cent in 1995. Take the disability support pensioners. We had 6.3 per cent of disability support pensioners reporting earnings in June 1995 which was up from only 3.8 per cent as recently as 1991. Over the last decade the proportion of age pensioners receiving a part-pension has increased from 24.4 per cent to 32.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those statistics give the lie to the claim that we see reiterated around the talkback circuits and echoed in the opposition speaking notes that somehow our measures are creating a situation of welfare dependency. On the contrary, the whole thrust of government policy has been to maximise incentives and opportunities for people to take up all kinds of full-time and part-time work. That covers not just those on unemployment payments but other groups that were previously considered to be more or less outside the work force, particularly sole parent pensioners and those on disability support pensions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you pay attention and you might learn something about these issues. As honourable members would be aware, there has been quite a debate in recent times about the situation of so-called battlers and the impact of government policies on equality or inequality, and on living standards. We have seen from the opposition side such champions of the oppressed and the underprivileged as the member for Kooyong taking up the cudgels&mdash;I regret to see he is not in the chamber today. I thank the honourable member for Throsby for his question. It means that he has already exceeded the quota this year of the opposition spokesperson on social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall the Leader of the National Party claiming that the top 20 per cent&mdash;the top quintile&mdash;of income earners earn 10 times as much as the bottom 20 per cent. I said at the time that this was wrong and that there was an obvious methodological error. I have been proved correct in a recent report by the OECD on income distribution in OECD countries. The OECD report shows a ratio of four to one, which is less than half the level of inequality claimed by the Leader of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the OECD report shows that Australia has the most progressive social security system and the most progressive taxation system of any of the countries studied. That is shown by the fact that the lowest income group in Australia receives a higher share of social transfers and pays less income tax than in any of the other countries under study. Even this understates the degree of progressivity of the Australian system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We rely less on regressive indirect taxes, which are not included in the study. Our social security system has greater redistributive impact over people's lifetimes than insurance based systems. This, too, is not taken into account in the study. Much of the redistributions shown in systems with social insurance schemes are really just redistributions for the same people over their lifetimes. Ours is more redistributive between individuals. Our system has improved significantly since the date of the OECD study, which was drawn in the 1980s, particularly in terms of family payments and the achievement of the 25 per cent of average weekly earnings goal for pensions. The study does not include the impact of our high and relatively equal level of home ownership or the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So even with the raw information contained in this study, our system of taxes and social security is shown to be highly progressive; in fact, the most progressive of the group of countries studied. Even that understates the degree of progressivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the sort of thing going on in countries like the United Kingdom with governments of a similar persuasion as the opposition. In that case they have done what the Leader of the Opposition said he would do in regard to pensions in his wasteland speech to ACOSS, that is, to just maintain the pension in real terms through indexation. We have had a range of contradictory statements from the opposition subsequently about the 25 per cent goal. So pensioners are entitled to be quite sceptical. In the case of the UK the pension was cut from around 20 per cent of average earnings in 1981 to 16 per cent in 1990. It is likely to be around 14 per cent by the year 2000. That is the best sort of result pensioners can expect from a coalition government of a similar persuasion and ideology to that of the conservative government in the UK.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member, who has had a great interest in these matters over the years, has drawn attention to perhaps the biggest question in the aid field there is at the moment, the biggest issue we need to address. As members will know, the IDA, the International Development Association, is the soft loan arm of the World Bank. It provides development credits on concessional or near-to-grant terms to the poorest amongst the developing countries. In order to do that it depends on regular replenishments of its resources by donor countries. It is the case that negotiations on the 11th replenishment of IDA began about a year ago. They have now reached a critical stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member reflected in his question, the negotiation process has been very greatly complicated by the fact that the Republican controlled United States Congress has reneged on a sizeable proportion of its commitment to the last replenishment of IDA. As a result of that, the administration has made it clear that there is no prospect of a United States commitment to the IDA 11 replenishment at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IDA is the single largest source of concessional finance for developing countries. Any substantial reduction in funding for IDA 11 could have disastrous flow-on effects for other multilateral and bilateral aid programs and for the countries which they assist. The effectiveness of IDA's operations in development terms is widely acknowledged. There are still those in some quarters&mdash;and some of them are in this House&mdash;whose motto is `World Bank bad, NGOs good'. The government, by contrast, believes that both are good, that both have a role to play and that IDA is at the cutting edge in areas such as donor coordination, policy dialogue, economic and sectoral research and program design and evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, the World Bank has reinvigorated its loan portfolio and its processes in response to a couple of events, particularly the 1992 Wapenhans report into the administration of the bank. The second event, something which Australians should feel great pride about, is the coming to office of Jim Wolfensohn, a very distinguished Australian-American, with his recent appointment to the presidency of the World Bank. Other Australian ministers, NGOs and I had a long talk to Jim when he was in Australia recently. The prospect of this government working under the stewardship of an invigorated and enlightened leader in the World Bank is very exciting. I believe that together we can achieve a great deal, particularly in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an Australian perspective, it is very difficult to overestimate the value to us of having the World Bank engaged in countries of particular concern to us. Papua New Guinea is an example, where the structural adjustment program has been extremely important in saving that country from past policies. It is also true in other countries where Australia has strong aid, foreign policy or trade ties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to be able to take this opportunity to say that, when the government decides on the level of Australia's contribution to IDA 11, we will not be seeking to minimise our share of the financing burden; on the contrary. As the Treasurer intimated when he spoke in Washington recently, we will be giving positive consideration to a supplementary contribution above Australia's calculated burden share. Given the pivotal role of IDA in the international aid effort and the flow-on effects which the replenishment will have, what is needed from all donors is a clear vote of confidence in the multilateral system, IDA and Jim Wolfensohn's objectives for the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as we can, we will be seeking in that replenishment to make sure that the United States is brought to discharge its own obligations. That may mean that we have to put in a conditional replenishment so that the United States will not benefit from a procurement in the bank as a result of a reduced contribution. Those benefits are very substantial. In 1994-95, for example, Australia contributed $A113 million to the World Bank. Australian companies received $327 million worth of contracts with the bank. So that is a very good investment, even from the point of view of self-interest. By contrast, the approach of the US administration is simplistic, short-sighted and blinkered. A failure will really inhibit the operations of the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has carefully talked all through this answer. I am pretty confident that their approach is as short-sighted and blinkered as the one of the US Congress. Why is that? Like other ministers, I have had an opportunity to look through these fine Liberal Party speakers notes. When one looks through the section on Australia in the world, what does one find? There are sections on Australian independence, the Australian constitution, defence, the flag and trade. But it is absolutely innocent of any reference to foreign policy and foreign aid. It is not just that it says nothing; there is not even a heading on it in the whole document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing the opposition has said on this subject is that it proposes to slash $200 million out of the aid budget. There has been no statement from the opposition since. It would be nice to have some answers. I do not imagine that we will get them from an opposition so bereft of ideas as this one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday we took the unusual step of releasing immediately upon its presentation the Industry Commission's report into work health and safety. We did this because we have always operated on the basis here of cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and the ACCI and ACTU. It is important and I wanted all of those stakeholders to read the document so that I might consult with them before the Commonwealth makes a response to this report on worker health and safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a timely report inasmuch as it comes now 10 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth's arm here, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, which, I might say, has done a great deal of work in lifting the standards of care over workers in workplaces around Australia. The tenor of the recommendations to Australian governments of this commission is very important. It is a very intelligent report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report recommends, for instance, that governments should streamline but strengthen regulation with fewer and simpler rules, allow greater flexibility for workplaces to manage injury and disease, beef up enforcement of the key legal responsibilities, strengthen financial incentives for safer workplaces, overhaul cooperation between Australian governments and provide greater contestability and transparency in research and funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might ask why it is so important. Let me relay to you some of the statistics as published in this Industry Commission report. The number of Australians who are killed or injured as a result of their work is in a sense appalling. Each year around 500 Australians die as a result of traumatic injury at work; between 650 and 2,200 workers die as a result of occupational cancers which, in the majority of cases, are due to exposure to hazardous materials; and up to 650,000 workers, or one in every 12 working Australians, suffer injury and illness from work&mdash;and almost two-thirds of those will have to take time off work. In addition, the report indicates that at any time the accumulated effects of work related injury and ill health mean that up to 140,000 Australian workers cannot work at their full capacity, over 270,000 workers have had to reduce permanently their hours of work or change their jobs and about 200,000 persons are prevented from working at all.</PARA>

Perish the thought that it might have had something to do with what has become the opposition's style on economic policy in this place over the last little while: statement in the morning, correction by press release in the afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, we had a statement in the afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition and then an attempt to correct it and imply that somehow or other the journalist who had quoted his backsliding from the principal point in his headland speech had got him wrong. The Leader of the Opposition walked back off his principal point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the honourable member for Scullin had to stand up and ask an economic question in this House. What he said in his question is quite correct. The national accounts data released today revealed a record growth&mdash;that is, 17 quarters of growth. That 17 quarters of growth has produced a 17 per cent improvement in our gross domestic product&mdash;an improvement in line with what the government had anticipated would be produced from its sound fiscal policies, its sound micro-economic policies, its sound industry policies and its sound policies on encouraging export. That 17 per cent effectively works out to be an annual rate of four per cent growth over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incorporated within that 17 quarters of growth is a massive improvement in labour productivity. There has been an annual average change of 2.9 per cent under our industrial relations policies. Contrast that with the situation in New Zealand: under their industrial relations policies&mdash;which the opposition endorses&mdash;productivity growth in New Zealand has been slightly less that half of ours. It is a remarkable contrast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can then go to the real household per capita income. The annual average improvement revealed in these statistics of 17 quarters of growth was 2.6 per cent, and the total change over that period was 11.6 per cent. For the real household disposable income, there was a 3.7 per cent improvement, and the overall rate of change over that time was 16.9 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a useful two per cent lift in gross savings during this quarter. In terms of gross savings across the board, there has never been a higher rate than in those 17 quarters of growth. Indeed, in relation to savings, there is only one proposition on the table in the private savings area that has any meaning at all and that will improve our private savings performance&mdash;that is, of course, the government's policy on superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that these excellent figures have come through. They show that we have achieved the steady growth which the government's policies have been directed towards. When you look at the inwardness of the figures, it is obvious what impact our policies are having on household incomes&mdash;there is good growth there. When you look at what the figures represent in terms of the Australian work force, again, you see good performances there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week we have learned that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) wants to do in a decent pension, as well as wanting to do in fair and decent wages for workers. The last time we had a run-up to a federal election the opposition wanted to whack working people and pensioners with a 15 per cent GST. This time they want to snip the pay packet and snip the pension before it arrives in working people's and pensioners' pockets. They want to do in the award safety net, slash wages and conditions, and they want to do in the link between the pension and 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the MPI reflects&mdash;`The importance of a government commitment to maintaining living standards through social and industrial safety nets'&mdash;the government is absolutely committed to protecting and preserving these social and industrial safety nets through the award system and through the pension and its linkage with 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. What we know is that the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition are absolutely committed to doing these things in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us start with the pension. We saw the Leader of the Opposition on one of the TV programs on Sunday talking about the pension. And what are some of the things we know about the record of this government in its treatment of pensioners and the level of pension? Before this government came to office, pensions were not indexed and now they are indexed twice yearly. When the government came to office, pensions were around 22 per cent of average weekly earnings; they are now at nearly 26 per cent&mdash;25.7 per cent&mdash;and they have been matching the government's 25 per cent of average weekly earnings commitment for three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the opposition was last in power, pensions fell by a real two per cent and, in the course of this government's term of office, they have gone up in real terms. But the most intriguing thing about the Leader of the Opposition's performance on Sunday is, I think, best reflected by the following exchange when he was asked about pensions. Michelle Grattan asked him the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensions, would you retain them?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compere: Aged pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard: Absolute ironclad retention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michelle Grattan: Twenty-five per cent of average weekly earnings?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard: Well. Well. We're going to retain the present system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard: Well, we retain the adjustment to CPI and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michelle Grattan: And the 25 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard: Well the 25 per cent is a goal of the Government's.</PARA>
<PARA>That confirms what we discovered in the Leader of the Opposition's headland speech to ACOSS when he made absolutely no mention of the linkage between the pension and the 25 per cent commitment. As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) pointed out in the course of question time, we subsequently saw an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition, through press release later on Sunday afternoon, to somehow reclaim that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Australian pensioners should understand what John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, really wants to achieve by breaking the link between 25 per cent average weekly earnings and the pension system&mdash;by looking at the record when he was in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When John Howard was Treasurer, he cut pensions by two per cent in real terms. Under this government, pensions have gone up by 14 per cent. Some members may well recall that in 1979, John Howard denied pensioners an indexation increase because inflation had `fallen', as he put it, to eight per cent. Of course, he allowed pensions to fall substantially below the 25 per cent linkage to as low as 22-odd per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you examine some of the other aspects that are important to pensioners and look at the comparison between the government's record and the record of the coalition with John Howard as Treasurer, you discover that, under the coalition from December 1975 to March 1983, for a single age pensioner not renting, the pension suffered a real drop in its value of 2.3 per cent and, for those renting privately, a 2.2 per cent drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That compares with the record of this government: from March 1983 to June of this year, for those not renting, a real increase of 11.9 per cent and, for those renting privately, a real increase of 20.4 per cent. The respective figures so far as an age pensioner couple is concerned is: under the coalition, 2.1 per cent in both categories; under this government, 12 per cent for those not renting and 16.5 per cent for those who are renting privately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 28 November earlier this week that Mike Seccombe wrote a piece which he described as, `Howard shows he can do a Downer'. I am not sure that Mr Seccombe got it quite right, but there are a couple of comments here which are worth reading into the record. Mr Seccombe says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cruel television in close-up&mdash;capturing the pathetic look of indecision and the long pause which said more clearly than words, `I haven't a clue what I'm talking about.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard has better control of his facial expressions and a far more practiced line in obfuscation, which is lucky for him because on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> he very nearly did a Downer.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Seccombe in his article then refers to the former Leader of the Opposition and his trek into the outback. Mr Seccombe finishes his comment by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard's release finished, `Surely even the Keating government should have the decency not to attempt a fear campaign on something as sensitive as the basic level of the pension.'</PARA>
<PARA>And Mr Seccombe says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wrong. They would. And they would be credible in doing it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is because it is not a fear campaign, it is a fact campaign&mdash;it is telling the truth. Mr Seccombe concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It shows just how vulnerable Howard can be once he starts to actually enumerate policies rather than duck and weave. It shows that there is a very good chance he can still choke, like Downer before him, because he doesn't quite know what he believes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Mr Seccombe got that bit slightly wrong so far as pensions are concerned. We know absolutely what John Howard believes in so far as pensions are concerned. He wants to do in, as much as he can, a decent pension for Australia's pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important aspect of living standards is the need to ensure that working people in Australia have a fair and decent safety net and fair and decent conditions. We know the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has absolutely handcuffed himself to the policies that I have seen in my own state of Western Australia pursued by Premier Richard Court and the industrial relations minister, Graham Kierath. We find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Saturday 29 July the headline, `Howard: WA is our model'&mdash;we see the handcuff clinched on. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Federal coalition government would mirror the industrial relations policies implemented by the Court Government in Western Australia, Federal Opposition Leader John Howard said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition Government has implemented in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In the article we find as well a quote from Premier Richard Court saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that the Federal (coalition's) industrial relations policy will be modelled on what we have successfully implemented here.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, was a reference to what is known as the first wave of industrial relations legislation in Western Australia. Although it is quite clear from subsequent comments which I have read to the House on previous occasions that Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, has also handcuffed himself to the first draft of the second wave of Mr Kierath's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the effect of this industrial relations legislation in Western Australia? The effect of the legislation in terms of industrial harmony is that strikes have increased and will increase. Industrial disputation will go up. The effect of that legislation on wages and conditions, which are fundamental to the living standards and the lifestyles of ordinary Australians, is that overtime rates of pay are optional, penalty rates for working nights and weekends disappear and holiday leave loading is a thing of the past. We have a mirage of suggested minimum standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real catch, the real purpose, of the industrial relations legislation in Western Australia, which Mr Howard wants to implement nationally, was exposed and expressed no better than by Minister Graham Kierath himself on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> show on the ABC on 23 August 1995. When describing his system to the presenter on that occasion and referring to the implementation of the legislation, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we did that quite deliberately, we thought that there would be some areas of the labour market that were over-priced and needed to be re-adjusted, what we would call low-skilled, low paid starter jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a deliberate policy of reducing wages for average and ordinary workers in Australia. This theme is repeated in the confidential Liberal Party's speakers notes of November 1995. If you go to the industrial relations section in that document, you will not find any incriminating detail. The editors have, however, done an imperfect job of keeping out what the Liberal Party really believes in. On page 43 in the regional development section it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">remove impediments&mdash;like inflexible labour conditions and awards&mdash;to growth in the regions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So in regions like Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, or even Victoria or New South Wales, the Liberal Party's solution to growth in those regions is to push down wages and to remove and reduce conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred in passing to the minimum entitlements in the Western Australian legislation. Those minimum entitlements are a minimum weekly wage, which the Court government set at $317, which was less than a recommendation made by the Industrial Relations Commission and less than a recommendation made by a consultant to the minister; four weeks annual leave; and 12 months unpaid parental leave. For young people in Western Australia, the minimum hourly rate has been set by the government at $3.77 an hour. As I have already indicated, there is no guarantee of overtime penalty rates or holiday loadings in the legislation. </PARA>

In 1984, under this government, it was 76. The number of industrial disputes in 1981 when John Howard was Treasurer was 2,915. In 1994, under this government, it was 558. So that is John Howard's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition very much likes to handcuff himself to Western Australia's industrial relations legislation and to the Court government's system of industrial relations in Western Australia. I would like to digress slightly and pick up a point that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) made, which was that in very many respects the Liberal Party in Western Australia does not necessarily pay much heed or attention to the Leader of the Opposition. That is probably best reflected by the headline of a front-page story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 April this year, `Stay out, WA Libs warn Howard'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the record of this government over the last 13 years? Since Labor came to office in 1983, the earnings of the least well paid 10 per cent of workers have declined by 0.93 per cent in real terms. That does not sound to me like much of a maintenance of the safety net. Over the same time, earnings of the highest paid 10 per cent of workers have increased by some 17 per cent. So there has been a dispersion of earnings&mdash;those on lower wages earning less, those on higher wages earning more&mdash;and the living standards of Australians have fallen over 13 years, the life of two Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) harped at the beginning of his speech about social security. He said that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> last Sunday failed to make a commitment with respect to social security. I want to make it clear, and I will quote the Leader of the Opposition. On 26 November 1995, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear and absolute Coalition policy both to index pensions on a twice yearly basis in accordance with the Consumer Price Index and as well maintain their value at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA>

It means that on those two points there is absolutely no difference between the coalition and the Labor government policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had a promise about pensioners. Do you remember what that promise was? I remember that promise about pensioners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue in this matter of public importance, quite frankly, is something else. When we talk about safety nets, there is only one real safety net in the system for Australians who want jobs, and for all Australians, and that is jobs. It is jobs, it is jobs and it is jobs. If we want higher standards of living then we all need jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any society that can employ all of those people who want to work in paid employment is a society which has a well functioning economy with high standards of living. But Australian standards of living over the last 13 years have fallen under this Labor government, which has the hypocrisy to come into this House and raise a matter of public importance about what a terrific job it has done in maintaining safety nets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor used to be the political party of the battlers. It used to be the political party that stood for employment, that stood for jobs. But not any more. What is unemployment today? It is 8.7 per cent, up from 8.3 per cent. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who is at the table, knows what I am talking about. He knows that it is still going up, that it is still ratcheting up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talk to any of the retailers and they will tell you that stocks are up in the manufacturing sector today because sales are down and because their projections for Christmas are rotten. Myer is not buying and Woolworths is not buying. They are not stocking their department stores because they are frightened to death that they are not going to have the trade. Retail trade is off; consumer confidence is down; and we are headed back to the ratcheted-up unemployment levels again. We never got down to anything like the unemployment levels even in the mid-1980s of 6.3 per cent. Nevertheless, the minister has avowed a level of five per cent. Labor used to be the political party which said it was for employment and for the battlers, but that time has long gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is the mob over here&mdash;and it says so in this matter of public importance&mdash;that stands for protection. They say, `We have to protect everybody from everybody else.' It relates to industrial relations, it relates to social security and it relates to jobs&mdash;the whole lot. Ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and he will tell you. What did he do? He cut tariffs. The higher the level of protection, the lower the standard of living, the lower the equality, the lower the sales, the lower the number of jobs, the lower the economic activity, the lower the level of competition&mdash;the less well off will be Australians, Australian companies and our whole society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best social security safety net is a job for everybody that wants one and transfer payments to those who cannot, for whatever reason, find a job or who cannot care for themselves because of some disadvantage or some disability. We offer all Australians that safety net. I have given you the Leader of the Opposition's absolute guarantee that we will retain the 25 per cent safety net for social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Perth should have gone outside the front of Parliament House at about two o'clock today&mdash;just before the heavens opened up and the rain came down&mdash;because he might have seen the youth jobs truck out the front of Parliament House. Do you know what that youth jobs truck is all about? I will tell you what it is all about. It is about an absolutely disgraceful youth unemployment rate of 29 per cent across this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what that youth unemployment rate of 29 per cent means? For 15- to 19-year-olds, it means that 143,400 young people who want to work do not have jobs, and for 20- to 24-year-olds, it is 132,100. That makes a total of 275,500 young people who do not have jobs. That figure is equivalent to four times the population of the city of Launceston in Tasmania; three times the population of the city of Ballarat in Victoria; ten times the population of Whyalla in South Australia; ten times the population of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia; and 1 1/2 times the population of the entire Northern Territory. That is a lot of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has the gall to come into the House and tell us that he took away giving us the regional unemployment figures for youth because they were inconsistent. The major inconsistency about those figures is the fact that they showed the high level of youth unemployment and the absolute failure of this government and its program, Working Nation, to deal with the devastation of unemployment of our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of anything worse than to deny young people the opportunity of having a job and starting a career. How debilitating can it be! You imbue these young people with hopelessness from the start. Undoubtedly there are many who will become long-term unemployed and who may never work all their lives. Their children may never work in their lives. They will be truly hopeless people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you what: we will fix it. We will fix it because we will beat this mob at the next election. We will see if we cannot turn it around very dramatically and very quickly. Labor hides its youth unemployment level by banning those regional youth figures. The truth is that the figures show an appalling failure over 13 years to address that serious problem. Unemployment is higher now than it was when Working Nation was introduced. The minister has no excuse for that. He has spent a fortune on training programs, sub-training programs and job subsidy programs but the situation is worse than when the minister took it over and said that he was going to fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force in 1995 are at their lowest level for three decades. Restricting access to many schemes until people are long-term unemployed has meant that the government's Working Nation program actually forces some people out of the work force. They become long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a few solutions for the minister if he would only listen. It is getting a bit late in the day for him to pick it up now. Our solutions include more real jobs by encouraging small and medium size business. After all, it is small and medium size enterprises that will employ our youth and adults. Other solutions include: active assistance at an earlier stage of unemployment so that people are not left waiting to be long-term unemployed; simplifying the training wage traineeships system to make it accessible and appealing; recognition of the regional character of youth in general unemployment through the establishment of community employment programs and structures; in areas where work is not available, allowing more voluntary community work which fosters self-esteem; flexible guidelines and more generic labour market programs including the removal of rigid guidelines and requirements for existing programs which has meant that help has been denied to young people who could benefit; placing much more weight on employment outcomes rather than the process; and abolishing the tendering process as a means of opposing centralised control over the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this matter of public importance today deals with industrial relations. We have heard talk about industrial relations safety nets. Among other things, the member for Perth was talking about the industrial dispute at Weipa between CRA-Comalco and 71 of its employees who are under an award. The member for Perth contends that the coalition has some draconian plan to slash wages and to lower the living standards of Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consistently said that our industrial relations policy will be a high wage policy. We want Australians to be able to improve their working conditions. This MPI deals with protection. The more rules you make and the stronger you make the structure, the more rigid and difficult you make it. The more demarcation issues you throw up in the system, the more costly you make the system for employers. If it costs more to employ a person because you are wasting money, you cannot pay the person as much as you could if you could remove some of those inflexibilities, some of those draconian measures which are put into the system, and some which have grown up over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember at Robe Iron back in 1986 there was a requirement for five flavours of ice cream at the canteen. If the five flavours were not there everybody went home and they did not shift any ore. That made Robe Iron fairly unprofitable. The company could not afford to pay its people very well. Our policy is a high wage policy. We will offer a very substantial safety net. We will make sure that Australian employees will not be worse off under a more flexible industrial relations system that is offered by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it really amounts to in the long run is taking the control of the unions out of the equation where the unions are not wanted. Where people are already happily employed and without union membership, we just want the unions to leave those people alone. Bill Kelty agrees with me that that is a reasonable thing to do. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 17 May reported Bill Kelty as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system already contains plenty of flexibility . . . including the ability to reduce wages for the majority of employers who pay over-award rates.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not want to reduce wages&mdash;Bill Kelty is talking about it. He is also reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . most non-unionists already have individual contracts. The majority are quite happy. They don't want to go to an industrial tribunal and have their wages and conditions regulated. You don't need legislation. You just can't contract to below the award rate.</PARA>
<PARA>We agree with that. I agree with Bill Kelty. He is right. When you see the fine detail of the coalition industrial relations policy, you will see that it reflects that. You cannot contract below the award wage. Employees, as they change from a centralised system&mdash;from the award system&mdash;to workplace agreements, will do so with the assurance that they are not going to be disadvantaged. We have always said that. </PARA>

The problem that he has&mdash;and the Liberal Party has in this House&mdash;is that he has a record in the area of pensions and industrial relations. He goes around pretending that the Liberals did not cut the real level of pensions when they were in power, that he does not have a hostile attitude to the award system, and that he does not want to abolish the award safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that when we pull them up on these statements they say, `Oh no. That is a scare campaign from the Labor Party; it is a campaign of lies.' When you ask them what their policy is, they will not say. They only give a commitment when they are sprung. The Liberal Party and those opposite refuse to answer any questions because that would eliminate them. The minute they have to be pulled down to the detail of their policy, when they are asked, `What is in the no disadvantage test? Are you going support a real level of pensions greater than 25 per cent of average weekly earnings?' they will not say anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party, under John Howard and his Jurassic Park front bench, are a bit like 18th century Sydney; they offer a variety of 18th century views. That is no more dramatically illustrated than in the area of industrial relations because their only method to create jobs is to reduce wages. They went through their speaking notes and they pulled out most of the things that could have caused them problems politically, until we get to page 43, which obviously was not correctly edited. We found on page 43 the following statement: to create jobs they will `remove impediments&mdash;like inflexible labour conditions and awards&mdash;to growth in the regions'. What does that mean? Cut the wages; get rid of the no disadvantage test; get rid of the umpire; make the employees sign contracts, suffer or get the sack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is their solution to unemployment. What do we find when we hear them talking about pensions? On this side of the House, we happen to regard a pension as a right. It is not a handout or a food order from the Smith Family; it is a right.

A pension is a return to honest, hardworking Australians for their commitment to the country throughout their lives. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a proud record. We have increased pensions to in excess of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;nearly 26 per cent. We have partly done that by indexing the pension. But the problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that, if we had merely indexed the pension, it would be worth $20 less now for a single pension or $34 less for a double pension. That is how much interest those opposite and the Leader of the Opposition have in the pension system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that any of those opposite could tell me now what is the level of the pension. Could the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) or the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) tell me what the level of the single or married pension is? Of course you couldn't because you don't mix, act or move in those circles. You have no interest at all in pension policy and, if you have no interest in pension policy, it says something about your fundamental values because even if $34 a week for a pensioner couple is not important to the Liberal Party, it sure as hell is important to the Labor Party&mdash;and it is very important to those people who survive on a pension and who are struggling to make ends meet. </PARA>

During the Hawke years in government, from 1983 to 1991, the average growth rate for Australia was 0.6 per cent. For the OECD it was 1.8 per cent.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CRA Ltd's chief executive, Mr Leon Davis, yesterday vigorously defended the resource group's industrial relations practices declaring that the company would continue to push for blue-collar workers to be on individual contracts. . . . Mr Davis said he had been a union member himself when he worked as a labourer in Port Pirie for two years and he had also worked under staff employment contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I can understand why people see that staff conditions are better', Mr Davis said. `People work better, at better productivity, than people who work under award conditions'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the recently reincarnated industrial advocate Mr Bob Hawke, a great personal friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He pointed out that productivity improvements can result from industrial relations reform. He admits it. He understands that, if you make some changes, productivity can improve. At these very hearings he tabled some information about Alcoa down at Geelong. We have seen some remarkable changes in industrial activity at that plant with the price fluctuations in aluminium. The plant was old; it was constructed in the 1960s. The work force has been reduced from 1,100 to 700 by natural attrition. A trust has been developing between management and the work force. Salaries have been annualised. No overtime is now worked. So there is an emphasis on getting the job done. </PARA>

More importantly, there is no trade union interference from outside the plant. The union heavies from Sydney or Melbourne do not come down to the plant to tell the work force what to do. Quality performance and results are the order of the day. Supervisors are gone. The bosses are not there to keep an eye on the workers because the teams are very keen to do the very best job. The teams organise their own work schedules. So now we have the Point Henry plant at Alcoa maintaining one of the best plants in the world for Alcoa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Two of the reports I have tabled involve accommodation projects proposed by the Overseas Property Group. The committee's 27th report for 1995 relates to the construction of accommodation for Australian High Commission staff at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The estimated cost of the Kuala Lumpur proposal when referred to the committee was $11.345 million at May 1995 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kuala Lumpur is fast becoming a city where most expatriates can no longer afford to live in free-standing houses as opposed to apartments and townhouses. The sustained demand for properties in Kuala Lumpur has made the cost of leasing residential accommodation very expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant proportion of the Australian-owned residential estate in Kuala Lumpur is nearing the end of its economic life or has proved unsatisfactory for the post's property requirements. Commercial and residential rent escalation has reached eight per cent plus per annum and the Overseas Property Group expects that, at least for the life of this project, rents will continue to escalate, particularly within the immediate areas surrounding the central business district and areas in proximity to the High Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic and life cycle costing analysis of options provided to the committee by the Overseas Property Group clearly indicated that constructing a mix of apartments and townhouses on owned sites, selling unsuitable owned accommodation and relinquishing undesirable leases is the most advantageous and economic course of action in Kuala Lumpur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kuala Lumpur proposal referred to the committee involved the construction of a three-storey complex of 10 apartments at 9/11 Jalan Taman U Thant and the construction of another 10-unit development on a site to be identified. A swimming pool, recreation room and multi-purpose room will be provided as part of each complex. At the public hearing, the Overseas Property Group advised that a decision had been made to develop 4 Jalan Taman U Thant. Investigations have shown that it is only possible to fit eight townhouses on the site. However, the Overseas Property Group has advised that this will still provide a viable project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that it will continue consultations with the post property committee during detailed design development. While there was general support for the Kuala Lumpur project from the staff at the High Commission, the Community Public Sector Union and the Foreign Service Family Association, there was some concern expressed regarding the extent of the development at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant and some details of the design of both buildings. As the site at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant was not confirmed until shortly before the public hearing, it is inevitable that there is some confusion in relation to the details of the development on that site. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group consult with the staff at the High Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and the Foreign Service Family Association during the detailed design phase to resolve outstanding issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's 28th report for 1995 relates to the construction at Shanghai in the People's Republic of China of a five-storey building of 10 apartments. The estimated cost of the Shanghai proposal when referred to the committee was $10.529 million at May 1995 prices. The rapid growth of the Chinese economy in recent years has meant that the Shanghai property market has grown at a feverish pace. The financial pressures on the Shanghai economy are unlikely to abate within the next three to five years. Rents are expected to continue to increase at an estimated rate of 10 per cent per annum. Residential accommodation of a suitable standard and size will continue to be scarce and command premium prices in sought after areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rents are currently in the order of $A19,000 per month and have a fixed escalation clause of 10 per cent per annum for the two-year leases. There are currently 10 Australian based staff in Shanghai, with staff numbers likely to increase in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of short supply and rapidly rising costs, the Overseas Property Group in late 1993 examined its property strategy in Shanghai, including options of ownership. Early evaluations indicated a simple payback period for a development option in the designated consular district was less than six years. The Canadian government has indicated an interest in either renting or meeting the capital cost of two of the apartments. The Overseas Property Group advised that negotiations on this matter are continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10 apartments in Shanghai will be constructed as a single building of five storeys incorporating two apartments per floor. An indoor swimming pool and a combined recreational room will be provided in a separate recreation facility. Basement car parking and storage areas will be provided under an all-weather tennis court which is elevated one metre above natural ground level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apartments have been designed in accordance with the design brief, taking account of local building regulations, climatic conditions, the surrounding built environment and the need for privacy, amenity and security for the occupants. Account has also been taken of the recommendations and requirements of the Consulate-General, which has been consulted in the development of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agreeing to the project proceeding, the committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group continue consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, staff of the Consulate-General and the Community and Public Sector Union regarding possible changes to the design of the project which will allow for a better utilisation of the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee accepts that many Australians at overseas posts would prefer not to live in compounds. But there is a basic dilemma if we wish to continue adequate Australian representation in many areas where we cannot afford the ever-increasing rental costs. So it is a case of building apartments such as those outlined in my reports or drastically reducing Australian based staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third report, which I have just tabled, concerns a proposal, sponsored by the Department of Defence, for the relocation of the Artillery Centre from North Head in Sydney to Puckapunyal, Victoria. The stated purpose of the proposal is to meet the training requirements of the School of Artillery and to make best use of existing facilities at Puckapunyal. This proposal will provide the school with ready access to a suitable field firing range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of office accommodation, instructional and storage facilities and living accommodation. The estimated outturn cost of the project is $34.8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed. The relocation of the School of Artillery from North Head has been the subject of a number of studies undertaken by Defence. Since 1990, public announcements by a number of defence ministers have alluded to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, the school was to go to Townsville, Queensland. With the relocation of the 1st Armoured Regiment to Darwin, facilities became available at Puckapunyal. This factor, and the large field firing range at Puckapunyal, prompted Defence to re-examine the Townsville option. A further study revealed that the school could be located at Puckapunyal at significantly less cost than Townsville, or other possible locations for that matter, by constructing a number of new facilities and refurbishing existing facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the committee was somewhat different from other projects examined during the year. In this particular instance there was intense opposition to the move from North Head from local members of parliament, the Manly Council and a number of local community groups. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) left the committee in no doubt regarding his opposition to the move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite claims to the contrary, the committee believes opposition to the move is based more on local interests than national defence interests. North Head is a very pleasant location, but it lacks access to a field firing range. The range at Holsworthy is no longer suited for the type of training undertaken. It suffers from urban encroachment, is too small and is under the flight path to Sydney airport. It is also a two-hour drive away from North Head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training facilities at the school are inadequate. Clearly, something needs to be done. The committee has concluded that for the School of Artillery to operate effectively and efficiently it needs to be located adjacent to a suitable field firing range and to have modern, purpose designed training facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some apprehension in the minds of representatives of the local community about the future use of the land at North Head to be vacated by the school. The committee considers that much of the apprehension is focused on the developed area, comprising 15 hectares, occupied by the School of Artillery. It consists of buildings, roads, married quarters and other support infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of the balance of the land, some 60 hectares, has been assured by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). This land is either natural bushland or on the Register of the National Estate. It will be incorporated into Sydney Harbour National Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the future use of the larger area has been predetermined, a management regime will need to be developed under the direction of the Section 22 Committee. The Public Works Committee believes future uses of the 15 hectares should complement the objectives of the management plan for the larger site. The committee also believes this planning context should therefore preclude any development or adaptive reuse of land and buildings which are incompatible with, or detract from, a significant natural recreational asset on the shores of Sydney Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that these matters will all be addressed by the Section 22 Committee comprising Commonwealth, state and local government officials, which will develop a management regime for the land at North Head. Both state and federal members of parliament for that area will be members of the Section 22 Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also pointed out that an artillery battery needs to be located with the school at Puckapunyal. It was suggested that decisions regarding the relocation of the school should await the outcome of the Army 21 study, which is examining the army's force structure for the next century. The study is due for completion in December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, there is no battery at Puckapunyal. The committee has therefore concluded that it will be necessary for an artillery battery to be located at Puckapunyal to support the school. Whilst this must await the outcome of the Army 21 study, based on the evidence from Defence there is every confidence to believe that a battery will be relocated to Puckapunyal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may be aware that in recent years Puckapunyal has been upgraded to a modern and very pleasant army base&mdash;in fact, one of the largest army bases. The Public Works Committee has taken a keen interest in developments there. Some of the works examined in recent years include construction of a Royal Australian Army Service Corps Centre with an estimated cost of $8.4 million in 1972, redevelopment of the Armoured Centre with an estimated cost of $12 million in 1981 and, more recently, in 1990 the Stage 1 redevelopment at an estimated cost of $44 million. The committee was pleased with the positive response from the local shire to the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the scope of the proposed work, which comprises new construction and refurbishment, the committee has concluded that the scope of proposed refurbishment makes good use of existing facilities. New construction has been restricted to the provision of specialised training facilities and three new accommodation blocks to be shared between officers and senior non-commissioned officers, depending on demand. The siting of elements of new construction is in accordance with the master plan. I should mention that the scope and the cost of the proposed work include the facilities required by an artillery battery. The estimated outturn cost of the project is $34.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee questioned Defence about the basis of costings for the Seymour area when compared with capital city costs. Defence advised the committee that prices will be competitive and this and variations between capital city and local costings were factored into the cost estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was raised about the availability of housing for families associated with the Artillery Centre and the artillery battery. The committee was assured by the Defence Housing Authority that there is a stock of good quality houses available. Upgrading and refurbishment of poorer quality houses is programmed to occur before the arrival of the School of Artillery. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It goes without saying that I am very disappointed with the result of this Public Works Committee inquiry relating to the development of facilities for the Artillery Centre, Puckapunyal. This report may well be a great result for the people of the marginal seat of McEwen but this report's tabling is a black day for the people of Sydney and for the people of Warringah.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not blame the Defence bureaucrats because they were given a brief by the government. I do not blame the committee chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is a conscientious man doing a conscientious job. I do not blame committee members who were either obeying orders or trying to save the bureaucrats from the embarrassment of having their findings rejected. But I do blame the government, which is obviously prepared to sacrifice North Head on the altar of budgetary expediency. I do blame the government for being prepared to sell off one of the last and best unspoilt headlands in Sydney Harbour to protect its budget deficit. Page 11 of the report states in black and white for the whole world to see:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . over the next few years there will be considerable rationalisation of Defence property holdings in the Sydney area.</PARA>
<PARA>Rationalisation is code for privatisation. It means selling, and the people of Sydney must know that this government is prepared to sell out their heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence, conscious of the weakness of its position, changed its story several times in the course of these public hearings. First of all, Defence said that the move to Puckapunyal was necessary because the School of Artillery had to be next door to a firing range. Then, when it was pointed out that a firing range without guns is like an ocean without fish or, as Defence itself admitted, an infantryman without legs, they moved to the second position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second position was that the move to Puckapunyal was justified because a depot support battery was eventually going to be put there. They then went on to say that the stationing of a depot support battery at Puckapunyal, which involved an effective 50 per cent increase in the size of the School of Artillery, could actually be done without adding any more than half a million dollars to the $35 million cost of this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They then went on to admit that, in any event, even though this move was supposed to be justified because the School of Artillery had to be next to a firing range, wherever the School of Artillery was, its members would have to fly all around the countryside to different sorts of firing ranges to get the relevant practical experience. The third big shift in the story, when they realised how weak the argument sounded, was to say that staying at North Head would cost a lot more money than the $20 million put into the original submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the immediate past chief of the defence forces telling us over the last few days that Australia cannot afford to defend itself on the current defence budget. We are now being asked by this government to believe that it can spend $35 million willy-nilly to move a perfectly effective school of artillery, a school of artillery which has done a perfectly good job for 50 years, to Puckapunyal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one rational explanation for this. The explanation is that this government wants to sell that land for the best possible price. The real reason this government wants to shift the School of Artillery is to sell off the land so that it can protect its precious budget surplus, if that is what it still is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason, a reason which I think is operative in the minds of Defence bureaucrats, is the need to preserve Puckapunyal. But let us be very clear. This move to Puckapunyal is not about preserving the operational efficiency of the School of Artillery. It is about preserving the continued existence of the Puckapunyal military area. It is not about the defence of Australia; it is about the defence of Puckapunyal. It is not about a build-up of our defence capability; it is about a sell-off of Defence's land bank in Sydney. It is about privatising Defence land&mdash;putting Defence land into the same basket as this government has already put the ANL, Qantas, the airports and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Australia is never again faced with armed aggression. I hope that the people of Australia are never again subject to military attack. Last time that happened, North Head had guns and soldiers in place. Let us hope that, if it ever happens again, no enemy ever decides to attack Sydney. Let us hope that if an enemy ever decides to attack Australia it attacks Puckapunyal, because in the next few years this government will sell off all the sites in and around Sydney where our defence forces could stand and fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the curious features of the decision the federal government has made is that, while the sell-off of land on Middle Head is being conducted under the auspices of the federal government itself, while that particular plan of management study is being run by the federal government, the plan of management study that the government has proposed for North Head is being run by the state government. This is not being run by the federal government; it is being run by the state government. It is a section 22 committee set up by the state planning minister under the state planning act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the federal government washed its hands of this land on North Head? What deals have been done? What price has been agreed between the state government and the federal government to transfer what is currently Commonwealth land into state government hands? Have state Labor and federal Labor cooked up another deal along showground lines?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of public hearings, the chief defence bureaucrat gave us a definition of the meaning of the term `no commercial development on North Head'. This was the commitment that the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, had given to the mayors of Mosman and Manly earlier in the year. Brigadier McCann defined the term. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this was seen to mean no new construction for commercial purposes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that what could happen in the area was `low scale, medium density redevelopment'. In other words, old construction can be used for commercial purposes and there can be new construction for what the government obviously defines as non-commercial purposes, including medium density housing. In fact, about the only thing the government has ruled out on North Head is a brand spanking new shopping complex. The shopping complex could be put in the existing School of Artillery building and a housing estate could be built all around it to use the shopping complex. That would be possible under the federal government's definition of `no commercial development'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the member for Throsby has expressed the hope that the section 22 committee would not permit any development that was incompatible with the existing nature of the area. That is no more than a pious hope because the result of the government's decision, given voice by the member for Throsby, is that the federal government has completely washed its hands of North Head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to this parliament that if we lose something like North Head now we will never get it back. Once it is gone, it is gone forever. The risk is that future generations of Sydneysiders will look up at housing where now there are trees, they will look up at people where now there are animals and birds, and they will ask themselves, `Who is responsible for this outrage? Who is responsible for this desecration of what is almost a sacred site to the people of modern Sydney?'

They are respected members of this House and they are experienced members of this House in terms of the work the Public Accounts Committee takes. If what the honourable gentleman from Warringah has just said is correct, then he has just suggested that they are all the most incompetent, untrustworthy fools this parliament has got. That is the allegation he has in fact made about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has ignored the fact that the decision of the committee was unanimous, with not one dissenter. He ignores the fact that the move of the School of Artillery is nothing new. It has in fact been mooted for a large number of years, and in fact it was originally suggested that the school go to Townsville. The reasons for the move have been reported upon. They are longstanding and they are known by members of this House who have had an interest in defence matters for some time and it has not been argued by anyone in this House that  those reasons are invalid or incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the honourable gentleman says, it seems to me, is code for the opposition saying, `Should we be in government we will not have the school transfer. We will take the money, put it back into the coffers and say, "We are saving the defence budget some dollars".' That is really the message and that is really the code for what is being said by the honourable gentleman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Warringah was giving us the message that, despite independent assessment, serious consideration and prior announcement, a Howard-led government will cut the defence budget. He was saying that that was one of the ways they were going to save some money. It is irrational, illogical and unjustified, based upon the demand of Liberal Party people in New South Wales from Mosman and Manly, based upon state Liberal members and based upon the honourable gentleman's own desires to ignore evidence and simply leave the school where it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He suggested that a School of Artillery without guns is a nonsense. Yet that is the very proposition he is supporting. The simple fact is that Holsworthy is no longer a suitable live firing venue for defence&mdash;not just for artillery but for live firing generally. Holsworthy is now being surrounded by residential development. Obviously, the future of Holsworthy as a base is becoming very limited. I know that my electorate is very accustomed to the noise which rumbles through it regularly when heavy weapons are being fired. El Alamein, a live firing exercise, has been conducted biannually at Puckapunyal for a number of years. Apart from the 105mm Howitzers, the School of Armour regularly fires live ammunition there. We have the F111s which occasionally whistle through and drop cluster bombs or the occasional laser guided 2,000-pound bomb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Puckapunyal is a live firing range. It is increasingly becoming the major live firing range in Australia. It is increasingly important in terms of education and training of our soldiers&mdash;whether it be artillery, armour or combined operations with the Royal Australian Air Force; a matter conveniently forgotten by the honourable gentleman. You cannot maintain a fiction of having a school of artillery where you cannot fire guns. It is a proposition which is nonsensical. If you are going to teach people how to use artillery, surely to blazes you would have them where they can fire the damn things! That is pretty logical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to Puckapunyal itself, we know that the opposition want to close it. It is another means of saving money; another way that they can get some money out of the defence budget. They can sell it off. It is pretty good prime land, although much of the area probably could not ever be used privately because of the unexploded ammunition risk which exists. As I have indicated, it has been a major live firing range now for 30, 40 or 50 years. Large parts of the area are dangerous for people to wander around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Puckapunyal has undergone major change with the Defence Force White Paper. We are now transferring to the north of Australia the field regiments and the field units of the Australian Army. That includes the operative field units of the 1st Armoured Regiment. The Leopards are going north. But in Puckapunyal the School of Armour and one squadron of Leopards will be maintained for training purposes. It seems to me that in order to have a modern army you need to be able to train artillery, armour and infantry as a single entity. It is another reason why armour and cavalry units should be combined in training purposes with artillery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Puckapunyal has lost a lot of people. The 21 Construction Squadron has moved out and has gone up to the Murray. As I said, the final transfer of the 1st Armoured Regiment will take place in the next few months. Since we have been in government, we have spent a lot of money making the place civilised, which is unlike how the opposition left it. You can now live in houses in Puckapunyal where doors open and close. People now have decent housing, unlike how it was when I first entered it in 1984 as a new member to see what the opposition had left behind. The housing is adequate and is improving all the time. Robertson Barracks, the base for the 1st Armoured Regiment, is basically empty now. Yet the infrastructure is there. The large hangers that were used by the Tank Corps and the cavalry can easily be adapted to suit the School of Artillery and to store its weapons and the vehicles and support vehicles for artillery usage. AusAID is a commonsense approach to use rare and scarce resources to maximise the benefit of the defence budget. I fail to understand the honourable gentleman's arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, to me it is code; it is logical. I have called upon Senator Newman, the opposition defence spokesperson, to clearly state where the opposition stands on this issue. Would a Howard government shift the School of Artillery to Puckapunyal or not? I have been met with deafening silence. So the code is clear: a Howard government would not move the School of Artillery. A Howard government would take the money and put it back into the defence cuts that we know they intend to make. Otherwise, how will they get those cuts? How else will they save money in defence? They have attacked us and said that Australia is not ready and that we have let them down. But, if you are going to cut defence, you have to find the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the risk is that the coalition would close down Puckapunyal entirely&mdash;sell the land and take the money. The gentleman quite clearly speaks from a position of political strength within the Liberal Party. He speaks with political strength as a strong supporter of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He speaks with political strength from the power base of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He speaks from a position of political strength when his approach is supported by Liberal Party members in the state parliament. He is supported by the Liberal Party held councils of Mosman and Manly. So there are very powerful political forces within the Liberal Party at work here that do not want to see the School of Artillery move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I as a local member obviously support the move for a whole variety of reasons that are personal to the electorate. The improved positioning of people there will replace the soldiers that we have lost. It will bring some more wage earnings into the electorate and into the town of Seymour which has long relied on Defence Force personnel at Puckapunyal. Obviously I support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also assist the rural areas of Victoria that are suffering so much as a result of the massive public sector cuts in employment in rural areas.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural areas in my electorate are suffering. Jobs have gone, wages have gone and towns and small businesses are suffering. It is important in these rural areas to maintain Defence Force personnel numbers to assist that small business sector. Obviously, the honourable member for Warringah, who comes from Sydney where these problems are not apparent and where the government is not slashing public sector jobs, does not care. But I care, my electorate cares and the town of Seymour cares. More importantly, the Department of Defence agrees. This committee agrees. Everyone apparently, except the opposition, agrees. So I will watch with interest to see whether Senator Newman does in fact commit a Howard government to this move. I will indeed watch with interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about Australia Remembers, which has been a very exciting activity for many Australians during this year in celebrating and commemorating the anniversary of 50 years since the end of the Second World War. Throughout Australia it has been a great opportunity for intergenerational activity of Australians. Many young Australians did not understand very much about the Second World War but during the celebrations have had the opportunity in a great diversity of forms to learn something about it. A lot of the interest of young people has been generated by films on television. A lot of those films have been very educational and informative as to the types of activities that Australian soldiers, men and women, were involved in at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also helped to link Australia today with the ethos of Australia 50 years ago when it went through very tough times and people learned something about comradeship. I think today's young people in Australia sensed a great degree of community that existed back in 1945 with the celebration of the ending of this huge conflict that Australian men and women had been involved in&mdash;not just the people who travelled overseas and went and fought in different parts of the world; it consumed the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the men and women who did travel overseas and were involved in different war theatres began to talk about their experiences much more fully than has ever occurred before. Many of those experiences were ones that the men and women wanted to put behind them; they had put them out of their minds. One of the ways in which they found that they could cope when coming back into civilian life was by trying to block things out of their memories. Now, as they are getting older&mdash;many of them are 70 years of age or more&mdash;they are feeling that they need to pass on the experiences that they had to the younger people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a delight to see old diggers and women who were involved in the war effort go to schools and sit down with the students and to see the attentive interest that there has been from young Australians. There is no doubt that they have been fascinated with the stories and to learn maybe about what grandfather or uncle so-and-so who may have been killed in the war did and why they are no longer around. No doubt a lot of the stories get embellished as well. But young people have benefited a lot from the focus given to this celebration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for our nation as we grow up&mdash;in world terms we are only a young nation&mdash;that the history of Australia and its interaction with the world, whether in war or in other matters, is passed on to future generations. I want to pay tribute, at this late stage in the life of this parliament, to the committee that was established in the electorate of Braddon. It comprised Mel Good, Bruce Mahoney, Ken Jacobs, Karl Rowbottom, David Mainsbridge, Bill Wilson, Lionel Young, David Currie, Cocky Dyke, Max Williams, Chris Reside, Joe Ewington, Clyde Wiggins, Cyril Dixon, Bob Boyd, David Probert and Robin Allen. It was chaired by Cyril Dixon, who is one of the local mayors in the region. They did an excellent job in giving consideration to the proposals that were brought to them from within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with great pride that I say that I understand it was one of the first committees to get its proposals in on time at the end of last year. The funds were sorted out very amicably and distributed throughout the different parts of the electorate. The activities that ensued from the distribution of the $20,000 in the electorate created a focus for schools, for RSL clubs and for many other people. I just want to mention some of those in recognition of the work that was put in. The Burnie City Council had a full day's activities which involved 4,500 schoolchildren. It was an excellent activity in the Civic Centre of the city and involved a victory parade, a commemorative service and a concert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those activities helped focus that city and surrounding areas on celebrating the victory in 1945. The young people who participated in those activities got a sense of what it was like 50 years ago and the way in which celebrations actually took place&mdash;the real sense of relief that maybe life would get back to normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an evening concert young people heard some of the old tunes that probably their father or grandfather whistled and they realised where these tunes actually came from and what they meant to their father or grandfather. So it was a very worthwhile community exercise. The celebration of Australia Remembers in my electorate brought different communities together to create a sense of sharing in some excitement and a celebration over the ending of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the celebration was a train trip that took many of the old service men and women back on the same train line down to where they first did their training, which was from one end of the state up in Devonport down to the Brighton army camp near Hobart. You had 220 people on a train for 10 hours down and 10 hours back. In fact, it took  a little longer to come back because it was a steam train. On the way back it came through a property on which one of the local graziers had clipped the Hawthorn hedges but had not cleaned them up. After all, these days you do not have coal fired steam trains go through every day. The clippings caught fire and that created a little bit of mayhem and the train was held up for two to three hours until they got the fire tender in behind it and did a few other things. So it took a while to get back home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in those circumstances there was a sense of community on the train. People shared their food and drinks, had a good time together and coped with the situation. They did not grumble and grizzle about their circumstances. There was a sense of purpose in enjoying each other's company&mdash;something in our time that we could learn from the old diggers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australia Remembers celebration we tend to focus on the men and women who went overseas and those in the prisoner-of-war camps. While I do not deny the importance of that, I also believe it is important to focus on the work and effort of those people who coped with the men and women who came back from the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days there were not the social support services and the counselling services that we have today. Listening to the stories, you realise that men and women came back from extremely tragic circumstances. For example, they might have come back on a Wednesday night into a family situation and the next day told, `Go down to the workshop', `Go out onto the dairy farm', `Get on with life', `You're back in civilian life now', and within 24 hours or so they had to make this big switch from those circumstances with which previously they were faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often the women had to cope with men who were trying to make this adjustment. Of course, some of those people did not do it very well. I want to pay tribute to a lot of the women who really had to struggle with the circumstances of either a husband or a boyfriend coming back who had coped for many years with the trauma of war. They did it quietly, they persevered with it, they coped with it and they got on with life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have a lot of backup services to help people who have gone through trauma. Interestingly, on one occasion when I was presenting certificates of appreciation to a group of diggers, there was some dispute about stress leave amongst public servants in Canberra. It was a real contrast for that group of diggers: here were these people today in Australia having stress leave while working in offices and various places and these diggers were saying, `We never got stress leave when we went through the things that we did. We had to cope with it.' Maybe that shows to a certain extent the differences in age in our society and the way we approach things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These men and women performed a great service for Australia. Australia Remembers has been a really worthwhile project for our generation and an opportunity for the parliament to say thankyou to the men and women who gave us this free country. They defended it vigorously, some of them ill-equipped in circumstances which are beyond belief, and they did it with dignity and strength. They are certainly a group of people of whom we can be very proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate we had a very diverse range of activities for Australia Remembers. In some areas they had barbecues and gymkhanas. In another area an oral history was written. They spent their money in getting together and developing a booklet which really records a lot of the old times of the old diggers and the women who were involved in the war, so that at least there is a record of those experiences for the people in the area. Other activities included bush dances and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have enjoyed these worthwhile activities. The celebrations have increased a sense of community, which I think we do need today in our society. I commend the people on the committees in the north-west coast of Tasmania for the tremendous amount of work they put in. I also say a real thankyou to the men and women who actually served in the war, came back and contributed to this great nation of ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to join in this debate to take note of the ministerial statement by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on Australia Remembers 1945-1995. I am sure the experiences that we have heard about in this House from members from all sides have been replicated right throughout the length and breadth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at the outset, let me congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the initiative, leadership and support of his department led by Dr Allan Hawke and many other dedicated officers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I think they can be very proud of their efforts during this year. I am sure that leadership both at the ministerial and departmental level has been very much appreciated not only by the ex-service community within Australia but by the thousands of Australia Remembers committees and organisations that have done so much to make 1995 a very special year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most members of this chamber, around September of last year I heard about the intention of the government to commemorate 1995 as the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II through some material provided to me by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I decided that the approach I would adopt in my electorate, having been advised like all honourable members that we were to be provided with $20,000 seed money to support local electorate activities for this important year, would be to call a meeting of all the ex-service community organisations within my electorate, which I did in early October of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was agreed at that meeting by all present that, if we were going to make this a successful occasion in 1995, then simply more than just the ex-service community had to be involved. Important as the financial and other contributions and support of the RSL clubs and so on were, we had to involve the wider community because, as so many speakers have said, we were honouring not only the men and women who served in the theatres of war in 1940-1945 but indeed those people who supported the war effort back home in so many diverse ways. So it was agreed that we would set up a committee that would include certainly representatives of the ex-service community, but we also thought that we needed to think very carefully about the other elements of the leadership that were required to make this a successful occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suggestion was made that we would invite the newsreader from Prime Television in the central western part of New South Wales to be the chair of the committee. I would like to pay particular tribute to Peter Andren of Prime Television for, first of all, his decision to agree to take on the chair role and, second, his leadership during 1994 and 1995 in the lead-up to and the commemoration of this important year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Audrey Hardman of Mandurama was the deputy chair of the committee. Audrey Hardman has made an enormous contribution to not only the central west of New South Wales but also throughout New South Wales and beyond, particularly in her time as the state president of the largest women's organisation in Australia&mdash;the Country Women's Association. Audrey provided that important linkage into the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also invited representatives from the Red Cross to be on the committee. Mrs Lorna Smith of Bathurst, a well-known person associated with the Red Cross, represented their interest. Arthur Townsend from the Bathurst regional office of the Department of School Education provided an important linkage with the schools because, like any celebrations and commemorations, unless you involve the kids, it is not going to be a terribly successful commemoration or celebration. The reason so many celebrations right throughout the nation were successful was because school groups were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Mayor of the Cabonne Shire Council, Councillor Elvin Johnson, represented the interests of local government in the commemorations. Mr David Nankervis from Lithgow, the manager of Australian Defence Industries, represented that organisation because that organisation was once a small arms factory at Lithgow and provided a number of munitions and outreach plants throughout New South Wales. Some of those plants were in my electorate at places like Bathurst and Orange, as well as their headquarters in Lithgow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all honour the work of the Salvation Army. Whenever there is war, there is always the Sallies. The Salvation Army were represented on the committee by Mr Marcus Vass from Bathurst. Warren Holt from the Returned Services League in Bathurst represented the Bathurst end of the returned services community's involvement. Mr Merv Strange from the Orange RSL and Mr John Bolt from Lithgow made their contribution on behalf of the RSL. Miss Faye Clark RFD from Molong was also an important member of the committee and brought a perspective from women on to the committee, along with Monica Morse from the Bathurst City Council and Mrs Gai Feltham of Lithgow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very broad spectrum committee and in that sense, I think, we were able to get across to the communities in which the committee was planning events the importance of the celebrations and commemorations. We decided as a policy issue right from the very start that we were not going to go about building monuments. We decided that we wanted this to be a celebration and commemoration and, therefore, we wanted to involve as many people as we possibly could. We said we would support any communities which wished to refurbish their monuments, but financial support was also available through other programs operated by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to support monument restoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought that, by providing support for activities, events, commemorations and celebrations, we would make maximum use of the $20,000, and we did. I will give you some examples of the sorts of things we did. The Orange Art Gallery hosted the inaugural display of the Damien Parer collection of wartime photography. A most magnificent collection by one of the great wartime photographers was displayed in the Orange gallery for a number of weeks and was moved on to the Bathurst gallery for a few weeks. Some weeks after the exhibition in Bathurst, I received a note from the Bathurst City Council indicating that this exhibition had attracted one of the largest crowds ever through the Bathurst gallery in the few short weeks it was on display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed, as I am sure other members would have been impressed, by the way in which a lot of the smaller communities participated in the event. Having decided, for example, that we were not going to provide seed money for plaques or monuments as such, we were very impressed with the relatively small community of Canowindra near Orange, which raised something in the order of $10,000 to recognise every single service man and woman from the Canowindra district who served in a theatre of war during World War II. That matched a similar honour board that is currently on display in the Canowindra War Memorial Hospital. There were some 600 names there when the board was officially opened during the year of commemoration. Wisely, the community thought that, as in most of these displays, there are always going to be people whose names are inadvertently left off, so I am pleased to say that they have allowed for additional names to be placed on the bronze honour roll if any mistakes do occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various parades were held, particularly on VP Day, to mark the occasion and again the smaller communities came to the fore. The occasion was supported in the larger communities such as Lithgow, which had a magnificent procession, and Orange, which had a range of services. A very moving ceremony was held at the Bathurst Carillon on VP Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of publications, wartime experiences and poetry were all part of Australia Remembers. A particularly interesting concert was held in August this year at the little village of Eglinton near Bathurst which, I understand, was the site of the first memorial hall built after World War II, if not in Australia certainly in New South Wales. The children from Eglinton Public School put on a magnificent display in period costume to get some reminiscence of life back in the 1940s. It was a case of the Andrew Sisters `Eat your heart out'. They certainly won great admiration from those who were able to attend that particular concert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great highlights, in terms of the school activity, was a very generous offer by a person who has not lived in my electorate since the last redistribution, Mr Jack Griffiths of Mudgee. He was present near the signing of the surrender document in Tokyo Bay in 1945. Jack has a professional background in entertaining, in providing a range of entertaining experiences for people. Both Jack and his wife, Grace, generously volunteered their time and visited a range of schools throughout my electorate and beyond to tell their stories of World War II in Jack's inimitable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, it was a terrific year. One of the really nice things that have happened in recent times was the privilege of having the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow on 16 November to present certificates of appreciation. As so many people have said, the certificates of appreciation are available not only to those people who served in theatres of war but also to those people who worked in munitions factories, those people who were part of the Land Army, those people who were part of the civilian service corps, the civilian construction corps&mdash;anyone, basically, who made a contribution to the war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure I join with other members in encouraging people to apply to their local members of parliament for these certificates. As the minister said, they are nice to have in a personal sense, but they are very important memorabilia for people to have to hand down from one generation to the next. Anyone that has participated in ceremonies when those certificates have been handed out has been moved by the sense of occasion when old diggers, when elderly women, in particular those who may have lost their loved ones during the war, and when those people who have made some other contribution during the war have received their certificate of appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are probably still a range of other activities that will wind up 1995, but I think it is particularly poignant that we do reflect on this occasion to honour those men and women who served our country to allow us to appreciate the freedom that perhaps we take too often for granted. In many senses, these people who returned home after World War II really did not get a welcome home. I think we can say that right throughout the nation this year they certainly have received a very warm welcome home, a much deserved welcome home. As the slogan says, a grateful nation remembers their efforts from 1939 to 1945. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found there was so much happening in my own electorate that I had very little time to concentrate on what was happening nationally. I certainly know that there were many important events that involved our senior officials in Brisbane, for instance, but I did not get to them. I think that I managed to see a very significant parade in Sydney, but there were other events in Sydney that I was not able to attend. That is because this program was reaching every part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased when the minister approached us to call together from our electorates representatives of the ex-service community, educationalists and people involved in local government and community organisations to form an Australia Remembers committee. I can remember when they came together in my office very early in the piece to choose who it would be who would provide the leadership. Many of my colleagues decided that they would be president of their own committees, but I stood back a little in the case of the electorate of Berowra and invited those present to nominate a president from amongst their number. I became the patron of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Blackshaw, a former councillor of the Shire of Hornsby, a businessman, a distinguished ex-serviceman, the leader of the TPI association, was chosen from amongst his peers to be the President of the Australia Remembers Committee for Berowra. John Portlock, from the Hornsby RSL sub-branch, was nominated Vice-President. The committee had a number of very distinguished members, including Peter Beckley, who later suffered a very tragic injury in a motor vehicle accident on the deck of a service station. Somebody drove off without observing him walking off to pay his bill, and it left him quite severely debilitated for part of the program. </PARA>

There was Rosemary Hall, a community liaison officer representing the Hornsby Shire Council, and our secretary, Nicola Willis-Jones, who lives in Berowra and is actively involved in a number of community organisations. She was pregnant at the time and had to withdraw from the activities towards the end of the commemorative events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the nature of the commemorative events&mdash;the Victory in the Pacific, the Victory in Europe&mdash;and a lot could be said to add to the importance of those commemorative events. I was privy to many addresses which served to emphasise the reasons that we were involved in these activities. All of us who were too young to be involved ought to remember in a very positive way those of our parents and grandparents who gave of their lives&mdash;gave of their limbs, very often&mdash;who have suffered injury, some of which has been with them for most of their lives, and who have suffered often quite significant trauma. We owe them a very special responsibility. When I spoke to the young people, I said that this is an opportunity for each of us to say thank you for what they were able to do. They were very brave people who often gave up opportunities in life in order to provide for us the security that we enjoy today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember not so long ago that people were very unfortunately drawing inferences about Anzac Day and suggesting that it was about the glorification of war. I was terribly disappointed when we had those sorts of debates in Australia. Those who offered those sorts of views failed to understand what was involved, failed to understand what people went through and why they went through it and failed to appreciate the advantages that we enjoy today in Australia through the efforts of those who served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Berowra Australia Remembers Committee was probably one of the most active in Australia. It was not through my efforts; it was through those who served locally. I want to take the House through some of those activities. We had a calendar of events that took up the whole of the year. During January we were involved in putting out the posters to invite people's attention to the program. We commenced the preparation of newspaper supplements to be funded through local advertising, and we worked in conjunction with a number of newspapers locally and a number of newsletters that were circulated by specific organisations, like the Vasey Homes, for instance. It was important because people needed to have an awareness of what was going on, if you were going to get out the crowds and have schools see the importance of the activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through February there were a number of visitations to schools, encouraging them to embark upon projects on various themes using written, oral or video production for talking about the events.

Material of an historic character was collated from all over Australia and laid out throughout the Westfield centre. We had an official opening, which I was very pleased to perform for them. The New South Wales Minister for Veterans Affairs, a number of my state parliamentary colleagues, the mayor, many councillors from the shire of Hornsby and many hundreds of people were present for the opening of this exhibition. We had the Australia Remembers logo, which all of us have noted, especially painted for us. Mr Deputy Speaker, not even the chair you are sitting in with the very delightful wattle emblem behind you would compare with the size of our Australia Remembers logo hanging in the centre of the shopping centre. The minister, when he saw it, said that he wanted to get it for the Town Hall. We wanted to keep it for the Hornsby RSL Club. We had a bit of competition for that but, in the end, I think they got one of their own done. It was a part of developing the community interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to April, we had events associated with Anzac Day, including the Anzac luncheons and the commemorative parade which we always have in the shire of Hornsby in the main street. The Hills district sub-branch, the Glenorie sub-branch&mdash;I better not miss out any of the sub-branches that did hold functions at that time&mdash;and the Berowra and Brooklyn sub-branches all held Anzac Day services. During that time we were very actively involved in drawing people's attention to what was to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in May that we had our VE Day victory parade. If Sydney had a large parade, ours was fairly comparable. It involved all of the RSL sub-branches, together with ex-service men and women, Legacy, Lions, Rotary, Land Army, War Widows, scouts, guides, other community and service groups, the merchant navy and allied forces now resident in the electorate. We had a number of schools represented and those that had cadet forces were also involved. We have our own Hornsby cenotaph. We had our own memorial service that involved our chaplain, Don Simmons. I was particularly proud of that VE Day victory parade in Hornsby. It was a most memorable occasion. Following it, we had a veterans luncheon as well as a combined church service that was held in the auditorium of the Hornsby RSL. </PARA>

We could have had plaques put on them, I suppose, and names added. But there were no permanent memorials to remind people of the importance of the Second World War and these events. In the shire of Hornsby we managed to unveil significant memorials in Brooklyn, Berowra, Pennant Hills, Westleigh, Cherrybrook, Galston, Beecroft and a major memorial in Hornsby. They were very significant new memorials. We later had a tree planting in Fagan Park with all of the schools of the district involved. </PARA>

Since it was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 14 August last year at the Australian War Memorial, the program has gained a tremendous profile in the Australian community. The government has achieved its aim of igniting the nation's appreciation of those who fought and suffered to achieve peace and to preserve our freedom and way of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> During this debate I would like to take the opportunity to applaud Australians on the way that they have taken up and supported the Australia Remembers initiative. It is apparent that the memory of what our diggers did is alive and well out there in the community. It is too easy to complain about how hard life is today when a large proportion of the population have no experience of what it was like to live through a war. By looking back at what Australians and the rest of the world went through, we gain a greater appreciation of the relative stability and prosperity there is in the world that we live in today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Remembers has been all about resurrecting the memories of the ecstatic national celebration which followed a war that threatened our own soil. It has been about recognising the efforts of all those who served the nation, in whatever capacity. And it has been about telling the hundreds of thousands of stories that were played out during that horrible conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have been impressed with and humbled by the response from the local community in my electorate. The Watson Australia Remembers Committee, the local RSL clubs and the local historical societies have worked particularly hard in my electorate to ensure that Australia does remember. The committee has worked with many groups in the community with great success. I would like to place on record here today in the House of Representatives my appreciation to the members of the Watson Australia Remembers committee. They are: Mr Ellis Thomas, the president, Kevin Casey, Jean Scott, Warren Park, Fred Jubb, Ron Day, Billie Cutler, Margaret Murphy, Pat Dow and Bill Keighram. All of them worked very hard. I would like to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to the committee for their fine work and dedication in promoting the commemoration of the end of World War II during this year of Australia Remembers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It has been particularly pleasing to see the relationships that have developed between those who lived through the war years and the young Australians who are today enjoying the fruits of their labours. One of the projects undertaken in my electorate was the recording of oral histories of veterans by local high school students. The predominance of the nuclear family unit in Australia nowadays has meant that many young people do not get the opportunity to relate to older people, to appreciate their experiences, to enjoy their company and to learn from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The youth forums that were conducted throughout the country were designed to foster understanding and appreciation between the generation of those war years and the youth of today. From all accounts, this has been a very worthwhile exercise. Young people throughout the country have been working with school curriculum kits which look at Australia's involvement in the Second World War, remembering the war dead, the experiences of ordinary Australians in the war and what happened to them afterwards. Some of the activities in my electorate have included school students recording oral histories of veterans, the distribution of a book on the Women's Land Army to local school and council libraries, exhibitions by the local historical society and even a musical production of wartime favourites put on by the local Hurstville Light Opera Company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final project for the Watson Australia Remembers committee is the compilation and production of a newspaper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson Remembers</EMPHASIS>, which will be distributed to all students in the primary schools in my electorate. This newspaper is designed to give students a souvenir of the year of Australia Remembers; a souvenir which brings to life the experiences of their grandparents' generation during the war years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson Remembers</EMPHASIS> has wartime recipes; copies of ration books; stories of life during the war; cartoons by Jean Scott, a member of our committee, from experiences that she had in the Women's Land Army; a map of the world at the time showing the breadth of arenas where Australians fought; poems; and other pieces which capture the spirit of the people at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting and enlightening to see the reaction in my area, particularly by young people, to the book on experiences in the Women's Land Army, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Girls with grit</EMPHASIS>, by Jean Scott. Jean's recollections and stories of the war years on the home front from a woman's point of view were interesting for their fresh perspective. The book contains some very amusing anecdotes which illustrate that, although war is a terrible thing, people will always find something to laugh about, to make the load lighter, whatever tragic circumstances they are enduring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that the commemorative certificates issued from the office of the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Mr Sciacca) have been in great demand would be an understatement. I have presented many of these certificates to veterans and others who contributed to the war effort in my electorate, and I will be presenting still more throughout the remainder of the year. The final presentation will occur on 8 December. The response from those recipients has been one of deep pride in the recognition by the government of their contribution to the war effort&mdash;no matter which way it was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most poignant parts of this process for me was a visit I made to a nursing home in my electorate on VP Day where veterans with medals pinned to their chests could not hold back the tears when I presented their certificates to them. At that moment I felt the enormity of the sacrifices that these people had made for us and for generations of Australians to come. I also felt privileged to have the opportunity to share that very special occasion with them and to hear stories about the war and the war years from the people who were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think from my experience in my electorate, and from listening to the contributions of other members to this debate this afternoon, that Australia Remembers was a very worthwhile pursuit for those who can remember and for those of us who cannot; those of us who inherited the freedom and the new world order that followed. I believe it is always important for a nation to stop and take stock of itself and to commemorate as a nation the important events which shaped our history and which continue to shape our future, to look back and remember, to look now and consider and to look forward with a true sense of who we are as Australians. I believe that is what the Australia Remembers program has been all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is quite right and proper that we place on the record of the parliament our congratulations to those committees right across Australia who worked so very hard on these programs. My own congratulations go particularly to the Watson Australia Remembers Committee. It is most important that we recognise, as the Australia Remembers program has recognised, the contribution made by a vast array of people across Australia. We recognise their efforts during the Second World War&mdash;efforts which allowed us as a country to get a better idea of what we were, allowed us as a country to live in freedom and allowed us as a country to grow to what we are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who contributed to that effort during the war deserve our heartfelt praise. The people who contributed to the Australia Remembers program this year deserve our recognition and thanks. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to take up too much of the time of the House at this hour of the day, but I do want to say something about what Australia Remembers 1995 is not about. The Australia Remembers year is not about the glorification of war or the issue of international confrontation. It is about remembering those who paid the supreme sacrifice in the service of this nation. It is all about paying tribute to those who served in operational areas and who, fortunately for their families, returned. Just as importantly, it is all about those who remained at home contributing significantly to the national effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard speakers earlier in the day talking about the Land Army, the VRD, et cetera, all of whom of course played a very important part in the national effort in time of war. Australia Remembers is also about the reinvigoration of national pride. That is a very important element of Australia Remembers 1995. In my area&mdash;and I am sure it was the same in other electorates&mdash;one could see that the whole system that was implemented at the political level did reinvigorate a sense of pride. Pride has suffered in the past. People were looking for something. This program has reinjected into the community at large an enhanced sense of national pride and national spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very importantly, it is also about the involvement of the community at large in the general commemorative spirit of this year. That has occurred right across the age spectrum from the young to the elderly. Many of our young people have a very limited idea about history&mdash;particularly about Australia's war history. I think this program has injected into those young people a further sense of the historical origins of what this country was able to do in extreme circumstances in time of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also involved senior citizens, many of whom were directly and indirectly affected at that time&mdash;50 years ago. Many of them came up and spoke to me at a number of activities, and I will refer to that matter in a moment. Those people were very proud. As the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) has said, a lot of them came along to the activities wearing their medals, they came along wearing the medals of their fathers and in some cases they came along wearing the medals of their mothers. I go back to what I said about the reinvigoration of national pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the opportunity, as most speakers have done, to pay tribute to a number of people. First of all, I want to offer my very sincere thanks and congratulations to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) not only for the $20,000 that he was able to provide to all electorates to be used by elected committees in this year but for the way in which he has been able to handle the issue on a very bipartisan basis. It has been handled on a very bipartisan basis across the whole year. I do not think I can recollect many&mdash;if any&mdash;issues that have arisen in the context of Australia Remembers which have given rise to bipartisan political comment. Perhaps at times a number would have wanted to have done that, but in general terms the minister has maintained that very bipartisan spirit and I think we should all congratulate him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, I would like to pay tribute, as others have done, to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The honourable member for O'Connor is not known for having a strong sense of bipartisanship, but that is what he has shown in relation to this program. I think he has performed as the other side of the dog and pony show in terms of the Australia Remembers program. I have no reservations&mdash;and this, I think, would be on behalf of everybody in this place&mdash;in congratulating Wilson Tuckey for what he has done for the Australia Remembers program not only for the coalition but also in conjunction with the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to my local committee&mdash;in particular, the chairman, Bill Hills, and the secretary, Jeff Jimmeson. Jeff has moved on from my electorate. I am delighted to see the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) sitting at the table, because Jeff Jimmeson has moved to the federal electorate of Herbert&mdash;although I am not saying to the honourable member that Jeff is going to vote for him next year. Nevertheless, Jeff has moved there and has taken up a very positive position which will enhance his career prospects, and I am sure he will do well. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate both Bill and Jeff for the enormous contributions they made to the program, as indeed other members of the committee did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute to the RSL branches in Toowoomba&mdash;there are four or five branches in Toowoomba itself&mdash;and the branches in some of the surrounding townships, including Gatton, Oakey, Crows Nest, Cambooya, Helidon and Grantham. All of those branches were represented on that committee directly or indirectly, and all of them played a very important part in the way it operated throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank the five local shires&mdash;the Gatton shire, Cambooya shire, Jondaryan shire, Roselea shire and Crows Nest shire. All of them, in conjunction with the Toowoomba City Council, were represented on my local committee. Australia Remembers would not have been the success it was&mdash;and I think most people in my area would consider it to be a success&mdash;without their contribution. I would like to also thank the community organisations which were involved, and that included several organisations involving the youth and school groups. The year would not have been a success without their input and direct contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I would like to thank the people of my electorate&mdash;in particular, those who made an application and wanted to become involved throughout the year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my area&mdash;and I heard a number of speakers earlier talk about this&mdash;the important thing was the Australia Remembers certificates. They were important, and I think they were a great initiative on the part of the minister because they were treasured by people when they were presented. I have made two very large presentations, giving out about 150 certificates at each one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The certificates were not granted easily but, when they were received, they were received with a lot of pride for what the recipients or their families had achieved. I did make a number of presentations posthumously. It was important we did that so that we recognised those who had returned and died since but had, nevertheless, made a substantial contribution to the war effort and to this the year that Australia remembers. Next Tuesday I will be making the final presentation of those certificates, and I look forward to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also circulated some additional certificates which were to be presented to those people on the committees.

So I am presenting a plaque to the local area and, collectively, to those who made the contribution 50 years ago. That will be reflected appropriately on the plaque. </PARA>

I will start by complimenting both the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his shadow minister, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), on the good relationship and bipartisanship they have obviously displayed throughout the last 12 months in this program. They both should be commended for that bipartisanship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that bipartisanship is often forgotten by many people out there in the Australian public, but there are a lot of occasions where we work very closely on these issues. Honourable members would be well aware of those occasions. With all the committee work we are involved in and all the occasions where we travel together, we share pretty good relationships. I think that we actually can do that is something we can be very proud of. It is a pity our friends in the gallery do not always reflect that rather than those little sparring sessions that we have across the chamber from time to time. In actual fact, those sparring sessions probably occur on fewer occasions than the times that we see the great bipartisanship that does work in the parliament. I am sure that we all agree on about 90 per cent of things in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the very important document that we are responding to&mdash;the ministerial statement by the Hon. Con Sciacca, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I was very moved by his progress report on the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 program. I think his report sums up very much the feelings throughout Australia. I, like others, would like to take this opportunity to reflect on what has been happening in my own electorate over this last 12 months and put on record my appreciation, as the local federal member, for the efforts that a lot of people have put into this event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate, as I know all members in this place have been, to have had that cooperative spirit in my community. My local Australia Remembers Committee is chaired by a good friend Mr Alby Heck, who is also the President of the Railway sub-branch of the RSL. He has been very much supported by a very able team of people, including his counterpart in the Ipswich sub-branch of the RSL, Mr Stan Kent. They, along with many other people, have worked hard. I particularly mention those two because they are presidents of two local RSL organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate also goes out into the Lockyer Valley and the shire of Laidley. Even though that part of my electorate is going into the new electorate of Longman, I have still managed to keep a very good working relationship with those constituents&mdash;and I will continue to represent that area up until the election. In no way have I neglected it; and I certainly would not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was really necessary for us to form a separate committee in Laidley as well, albeit some form of subcommittee of the main committee which was based in Ipswich as a central focus and was the body that handled the funding. But the people in Laidley, being as independent as they are, picked up the ball and ran with it. That committee has been chaired by Mr Graham Hutton. He is a great fellow and he has done a tremendous job in coordinating activities in the Laidley community. His committee and the Laidley Shire Council, which is chaired by Mr Graham Moon, have all worked very closely together in that local community in Laidley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That small rural township has had a very difficult time. When we look out the windows now we can see it raining, but they have had a particularly hard time with drought in Queensland. I am pleased to note that on Sunday Graham Hutton said to me that they had had something like eight inches of rain in the last week. That is a godsend for them, but it has been a particularly difficult period for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, they have all responded positively and come together for this important occasion. They have worked very closely in the community. Within that community is another very good friend of mine, Mrs Margaret Langford, who has worked with the committee. It has been a great driving force for Margaret because, unfortunately, Margaret's husband, Bill, whom I have mentioned in this place before, passed away on 6 January this year after a short illness. It was a great tragedy for Margaret, particularly since she has not been able to share the year with Bill, who was a veteran and who served in places like Tobruk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been great for Margaret to be involved. She has probably set some record because of these Australia Remembers badges that we all wear, Margaret has sold about 1,000 in the local community. That is not bad for a shire with about 9,000 people in it. She has generated a lot of interest in this in the community. There have been street stalls and a whole range of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cover Laidley a bit first and then come back to consider the main part, in Ipswich. The Laidley council, the week before 11 November, Remembrance Day&mdash;it was the day after the Melbourne Cup&mdash;dedicated a park and called it Remembrance Park as part of the Australia Remembers program. They put up a memorial. Unfortunately, Graham Hutton could not attend that day because he was unwell, but his contribution was certainly acknowledged on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been tremendous community spirit there. I would like to put on record my appreciation to Graham Hutton for coordinating the Laidley section of the Australia Remembers program in my electorate, the Mayor of the Laidley Shire, Graham Moon, and all those associated with them. I mentioned Margaret Langford and I would also like to mention a good friend of mine Graeme Schostakowski, who has a big heart and is always in there trying to help. He is very committed to helping with these sorts of programs and he has done a tremendous job. I acknowledge very much the contribution they have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alby Heck has been chairing the larger committee, which is based on the larger area of Ipswich in my electorate. Right throughout the year we have all worked together and have invited people from Laidley, as part of the linkage, to come in as well. Some contributions have gone to the Laidley community out of that $20,000 funding. Alby has worked very well with the rest of the community. I also previously mentioned Stan Kent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schools have got behind many things in the community, as has our local RAAF base. I pay particular tribute to Group Captain Presgrave, the officer commanding 301 Air Base Wing at RAAF base Amberley. He is a fine gentleman and he has put the full force of the air force behind the whole program. It has been a tremendous effort by him. I thank him and all those people from the RAAF who made such a fine contribution and supported this program very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On VE Day in May it was the air force that organised the ceremony. That was a tremendous occasion for us as well. In our local community, on VP Day on 15 August, we had our own local ceremonies in which schools participated, but our main effort was to go to the big event in Brisbane. Ipswich is reasonably close to Brisbane so we did not want to do anything to conflict with that event. There were so many people wanting to attend it&mdash;and rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity to attend that occasion. It was a tremendous occasion. I congratulate Con Sciacca and all the people who organised it. Just listening to Con and Digger James and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) speak on that occasion, it was certainly a community tribute to those who have all gone before us. It was a great effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schools in my electorate have participated greatly in these celebrations. I pay tribute to one particular school, a little school at Redbank. The principal there is a woman called Colleen Engel. She coordinated a lot of efforts for Remembrance Day. The eleventh of November fell on a Saturday this year so it was a good day to get a lot of people together. Colleen did a tremendous job in organising that activity in a park near the Redbank shopping centre. It was well attended and well supported by everybody. The children participated in it. That was one of the highlights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year is not over yet. People are still recalling and remembering things. The member for Groom (Mr Taylor) mentioned the certificates. The more of those we make available the more interest they generate. So we are still making them available to people as they ask for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, I believe this effort has been something that we can always remember. One of the great things that has resulted has been the education of our younger people. My father was a returned serviceman who served in Britain in the air force during the war. He joined the RAAF here in Australia and then went over and spent the rest of the war in Britain. People of my age grew up in an era where we were very much aware of that situation because our fathers were so involved in it, even though our fathers did not talk about the war itself; they were pleased to get back home and get on with life. I suppose a lot of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren are learning a lot about what happened 50 years ago. Making the tribute that comes through from all those efforts has been a tremendous opportunity to educate our children about why we have the wonderful country we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of tremendous people involved. I could not possibly name them all, but I wanted to name another lady, Mrs Zillah Norrak, who has always participated in Anzac Day activities, a wonderful lady whose husband was an Estonian. He came to Australia many years ago, fought for Australia in the Second World War and always used to run the Anzac Day services in the eastern suburbs at Ipswich. After he passed on, Zillah always kept that event going. It is a great tribute to her that she does so. There is a memorial there that needs constant attention. One of the things coming out of this program is Operation Restoration, where we are going to do up a number of our memorials. We are working on that at the moment and a pretty good effort has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a gentleman, Mr Ken Williams, working on identifying all the memorials right around the whole district, not just within my own electorate but in other parts and neighbouring areas. He has done a tremendous job identifying all those memorials. We still have to get that finalised. He has identified them all but we want to make of them some sort of permanent record which, hopefully, will be maintained by the Ipswich City Council and the other local authorities. I hope we can get that done. I thank Ken for the effort he has put into that and for the effort he is yet to put into it. I put him on notice about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the clergy who have participated very much in the local community. On VE Day we had an ecumenical service. Naturally, many people and all the churches participated in that event. The Ipswich City Council, in conjunction with the Australia Remembers Committee, has produced a booklet to commemorate the occasion which was launched on 11 November at the function I mentioned for the Redbank school. Other little occasions have been remembered as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I suppose we have tried in some ways to get away from this being an RSL occasion. A lot of women have come forward who were around at the time of the war. They have told us some interesting stories and about the fun times that were had at the dances they used to have around that time. We had an old time dance one night run by one of our returned servicemen, a Scotchman called Jock Henderson. He did a tremendous job in organising that dance, which brought back a lot of memories to those women, who were only young girls at the time of the war. They all remember it so very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the minister in particular, and everyone who has been involved in my own electorate and right throughout the length and breadth of Australia for the support this event had.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the risk of stating the obvious, the Australia Remembers campaign was a great success in my electorate, as it so obviously has been in all other members' electorates. The importance of the event can hardly be overstated, honouring as it does those men and women who served Australia overseas or in the armed forces within Australia as well as those who supported the war effort in so many other different ways. It has been a very educative process for me and I am sure for many, if not all, of my parliamentary colleagues as well as for the community at large, especially for school children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For it is true to say that the deeds of heroism of the Second World War participants are not so well-known as those of the First World War. It has been said that the First World War became embodied in the Australian consciousness because so many Australian families had a son, a brother, an uncle or a husband who fought and when they returned home they passed on the stories of extraordinary hardship yet courage in overcoming the harsh conditions of war in Europe and at Gallipoli which established the reputation of the Australian armed forces for unparalleled courage and determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whilst the history of the Second World War and the sacrifices made by so many Australians are honoured, they have not been so widely known, as evidenced by the fact that not all war memorials or cenotaphs have the names of those who served and died listed. That was a startling surprise to me to begin to notice. Previously I attended most Anzac Day functions assuming that the cenotaph that we were all standing in front of listed the Second World War participants as well as those of the First World War. That is simply not the case. So a large proportion of the $20,000 budget that the Gippsland Australia Remembers Committee handled was spent rectifying that very problem. All memorials and cenotaphs in the small country towns and districts throughout Gippsland now list Second World War participants as well as First World War participants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Remembers Committee was made up of a representative from each of Gippsland's 25 RSL sub-branches. It was felt that that was the best way to represent the general community view. Such is the standing and respect with which the RSL in Victoria is held by the general community. It was a very good committee. Because the area of Gippsland is so large and there would have been, even at the most central meeting point, some hours drive for a number of those committee members we always held our meetings by telephone conference. That proved to be very convenient because all members could participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We decided after several meetings and much discussion to spend the bulk of the budget on a permanent reminder of 15 August 1995. Therefore, half of the budget&mdash;$10,000&mdash;went towards the making of a video of Gippsland service men and women and land army participants who served Australia during the Second World War. It is a magnificent video. It interviews several armed service men and women as well as those who supported the war effort at home. It interposes those very moving and revealing interviews with war footage, some of which is Gippsland specific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Beaufort bomber training centre was at the Bairnsdale training base in East Gippsland. There was an amateur photographer at the Bairnsdale base during the Second World War, so we could incorporate in our video some marvellous footage of the Beaufort bomber. At the same time, at the beautiful Wilsons Promontory in South Gippsland there were commando training exercises. Thankfully, there is some film remaining of those exercises, which we were also able to make part of our video honouring Gippsland's role in Australia's war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides the $10,000 spent on the production of the video, which the local RSL sub-branches can take into the schools, show to the children&mdash;it runs for 20 minutes&mdash;and then answer questions about, we also spent our funds on the restoration of cenotaphs, memorials and honour boards. It is surprising how many honour boards have fallen into disrepair. Some memorial halls and schools did not have honour boards for the Second World War, so we rectified that situation. As a result, all memorials, cenotaphs and honour boards throughout Gippsland are in a first-rate condition after, in some cases  only, some neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day itself&mdash;15 August&mdash;was celebrated by all RSL sub-branches throughout Gippsland in different ways. There were concerts and the rededication of memorials. There were marches and general get-togethers. They were all highly publicised in the Gippsland media, particularly in our rural newspapers. In the weeks leading up to 15 August, they would publicise the activities of the national Australia Remembers effort as well as the local one. There were personal profiles and the covering of events on the day by these country newspapers. It did excite an interest in a new generation. For that, we are thankful that the government took the initiative it did and involved all members of parliament and, through them, every local community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened with great interest to all members of parliament who have spoken on this motion. It is remarkable how many shared experiences there have been. Nobody could have worked on an Australia Remembers committee and not have felt great pride and personal satisfaction when the work of those committees came to fruition on 15 August. The thread that seems to run through most of the Australia Remembers committees is permanency. Everybody wanted to leave a permanent memory of the 1995 Australia Remembers campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Gippsland, it is the video. Incidentally, I hasten to add that it was shown by the Southern Cross Network on television throughout regional and country Victoria in early September. We are very glad that that network was able to do that. In addition, we have all of our memorials, cenotaphs and honour boards in sparkling condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also must not forget the new works opportunity program, which ran parallel to the actual $20,000 budget for every electorate specific Australia Remembers committee. It did great work in restoring some memorial halls in my electorate and a number of monuments. Where the tasks were too big to be funded from the Australia Remembers Committee, we knew that the new works opportunity participants would take over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 25 RSL sub-branches, none of the large sub-branches of Bairnsdale, Sale or Leongatha, all of which have poker machine income, asked for any funds from my committee. Instead, they wanted the smaller sub-branches, some with only six to 10 members, to get funds for the restoration of their honour boards and cenotaphs. The schools kit was well received throughout my electorate. It was a delight to see so many primary and secondary school children involve themselves in learning about the Second World War as well as putting pen to paper by way of essays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Remembers certificates have brought extraordinary emotion to their recipients. I still have some certificates to hand personally to my constituents who served their nation during the Second World War. It evokes tremendous pride and emotion in them. Above all else, they are so pleased that they will have a permanent thankyou from the Australian nation to leave for their children. Invariably the certificates are immediately framed by their recipient and hung very prominently in their home in a place of pride. They will be handed down for generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of them have never sought thanks from a grateful nation. Instead, they have taken comfort in the belief and sure knowledge that they served as their country required. Human nature being what it is, when thanks is offered, it touches an emotion that has often lain dormant. The Australia Remembers certificates have been part and parcel of our honouring the Second World War generation in the Australia Remembers year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very memorable year for those of us who have had the honour and privilege of participating so fully.

I am sure all of us would agree that 1995 has been a wonderful year for honouring those Australians who participated from 1939 to 1945 in the defence of Australia. That includes Australian men and women in and out of uniform and those at home and abroad who served in the defence of this country and in creating peace in the Pacific on 15 August 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) said, it has been a wonderful year because, for so many Australians, no-one had ever said thank you. I learnt a number of things during the year. Many people said to me, `When the war was on, you could not tell anybody anything. When the war ended, no-one wanted to know anything. They just wanted to forget it.' Others have said to me, `Well, the day the war ended did not mean anything to me. I was not here. I was somewhere in Asia&mdash;Sandakan or the Philippines.' After the war ended, some people were relocated to various staging camps before being joined up on vessels to go home. It was quite some months&mdash;for many of them, it was some weeks&mdash;before they reached Australia and then just drifted back into civilian life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere along the track in the 50 years since, other than for this year, has somebody publicly brought them out and said, `We, as grateful Australians, say thank you to you and to your families for the sacrifices you made so we may be here today in freedom and in peace.' When we look back, we often tend to overlook the role of families. The sacrifices were made not only by the man or woman in uniform but also by the family that was left behind. Those who lost loved ones both abroad and on the Australian continent suffered the greatest loss of all, along with their loved one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was moved when I made the presentations to the women who served, who are into their higher age group. The women were so emotional about just being recognised and when we presented them with their Australia Remembers certificate they told us that no-one ever said anything to them as women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago at the Legacy hostel at Norah Head, I presented a certificate to a lady in my electorate who had been a coastal gunner. I said to her, `You are the first female gunner I have met.' She was a wisp of a woman and she had been a member of the crew manning an anti-aircraft gun and a 9.7 gun in Sydney's defence&mdash;one would not think she would be capable of moving or handling guns. I then found another battery in my own electorate at Tingira Heights which was crewed by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the southern part of my electorate at Catherine Hill Bay there was a major radar station, which was staffed by 55 women. Catherine Hill Bay is probably two hours sail time from the port of Newcastle. Today, only the concrete shells where the equipment was housed remain. We sought to find some of those women but were unable to do so. We did not succeed in finding any of the women who had worked there but I do have as a constituent, Bert Cruise, in Swansea RSL. Bert was one of the guards at the installation to protect the women in case of attack&mdash;that part of the coastline was very vulnerable. So that is how we know all about the station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of Shortland was divided into two: the Shortland south Australia Remembers committee and the Shortland north Australia Remembers committee. There was a bit of scepticism at the beginning of the year about what they might do. We encouraged people to speak up and become involved. We invited various people, the RSLs and various groups in the community we thought would be interested in doing something. As the year progressed so the interest grew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our first event was at Toukley RSL in March when we held a major concert, at which some $3,000 was raised and handed over to torchbearers for Legacy. All the participants, the artists, gave their time free as a contribution to the afternoon. It was the first of the nostalgia, the first of the remembrance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 June at Norah Head we erected a memorial to wartime merchant mariners in the lighthouse grounds. Norah Head is a very significant piece of our coastline. On 5 December 1940, eight miles due east from Norah Head, the first Australian merchant vessel&mdash;a ship called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nimbin</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was sunk by German action. That vessel was en route from Coffs Harbour to Sydney when it struck a German mine that had been laid by the raider <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pinguin</EMPHASIS>, which had laid mines down the coast between Newcastle and Sydney, off Kembla and around into the Port Phillip Bay entrance. The stern of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nimbin</EMPHASIS> was blown away, seven of its crew were drowned and the rest were picked up by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bonalbo</EMPHASIS> and taken to Sydney that night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lived at Lake Munmorah when this all happened. We did not know that any of it was happening. It was only last year that I learned all about this. So on 5 December 1940 that was our battle sea. It was not on the other side of the world where Britain was under attack; it was eight miles off Norah Head on the central coast of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 June 1942, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Chieftain</EMPHASIS> was en route from Newcastle to Whyalla with a load of steel and coke&mdash;at that stage they were just starting to build the new shipyards at Whyalla. At about 9.30, a Japanese submarine surfaced and opened fire on Howard Smith's vessel, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Age</EMPHASIS>. It escaped to Newcastle by outrunning the sub, but the submarine submerged about 1 1/2 hours later and torpedoed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Chieftain</EMPHASIS>. The torpedo went through the engine room and killed 12 of the crew. For two days, 25 of the crew were at sea and finally came ashore on the entrance beach&mdash;which is just to the south of Norah Head&mdash;at 6 a.m. on 5 June. That was the first Australian merchant vessel to be sunk by Japanese action on the east coast in World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norah Head is a very special part of our coastline. Our memorial brings that point very much to the minds of the public. Three of the survivors from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Chieftain</EMPHASIS> attended our memorial. We have since discovered some of the people who were living at the entrance at that time who welcomed the survivors ashore. Hopefully we will have a reunion of those people on 12 December at Toukley RSL. The emotion and realisation about what was happening has helped to bring home to Australians the sacrifices, the difficulties and the burdens that their grandparents went through to defend this country, which is something they may not have given any thought to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you will be interested in this fact. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nimbin</EMPHASIS> was carrying a load of pigs and plywood. I was told a story that the pigs were in the water and the plywood was floating on the surface so the pigs tried to climb onto the plywood to survive. So pigs surfed ashore on Budgewoi beach. I have since found out that the survivors went to Sydney not to Budgewoi, but it sounded a pretty likely story. Pigs do not fly, but they can surf. They were Coffs Harbour pigs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Birdie Beach, just to the north of Norah Head, on 29 July, we had a re-enactment, or a flyover, of Wirraway aircraft and a navy Dakota, which brought home to the people of that area the role of that bit of coastline during the war. During the 1941-42 period, particularly in 1942, many of our fighter pilots from Richmond and Bankstown were trained in dive bombing techniques and low level aerial attacks from Wybung Head down to Norah Head. That re-enactment was very successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day at Belmont we had the unveiling of the memorial. We used some of our Australia Remembers funds to put that together. That was done by the No. 10 Repair Salvage Unit of the RAAF&mdash;Don Lowe of the New South Wales Catalina Association, Lackie Watkins from Belmont RSL and Jim Henderson from the RAAF Repair Salvage Unit. Members of the Repair Salvage Unit, again, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your edification, are the rogue scoundrels and undesirables of the RAAF when you meet some of them. That was a wonderful day. It brought home to people in the community generally the role of their neighbourhood and area in the period 1939 to 1945.

One way or another we are going to get it from her. The tank traps were what I thought was a creek, but it was a constructed culvert, almost from the sea to Lake Macquarie. The tank traps were put on the southern side because it was anticipated that the Japanese would land at Port Stephens and travel south towards Sydney, and that they would be held at Coaltea Creek.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very great pleasure and honour to be able to participate in this debate because the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 year was a great achievement for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). Comments made by many speakers on both sides of the chamber have drawn attention to the manner in which he initiated this program and saw it through to fruition, for which he certainly deserves the commendation of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also an event which has been of considerable significance to literally millions of Australians of all generations. More significantly than that, it is an event which helped to cement the relationship between those generations and, further than that, to give Australians who perhaps were not even born during those years&mdash;that is probably the majority of the population now&mdash;as well as millions of Australians who lived overseas and who have subsequent to the war chosen this country as their home a greater understanding of the historic process through which all Australians lived and survived during the years 1939 to 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For millions of Australians in a much smaller nation, in numerical terms, it was a cathartic experience. In those years I was very young&mdash;I was only two years old in 1942&mdash;but I was one of those who was evacuated from Asia before the Japanese onslaught following the fall of Singapore. I think I remember arriving in Sydney at the time of the Japanese attack on Sydney Harbour. My mother and I were evacuees and nobody really wanted to know us very much. We had to find the best deal we could for accommodation in the eastern suburbs. The place was literally empty. I remember that distinctly. Whole blocks of flats were empty. People had all run away because of the Japanese shells that were flying over them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were there for the second attack. I remember hiding in the corridor with the shells going literally over the roof. Young people in today's Australia perhaps do not appreciate that this nation, in every sense of the term, was under very great threat in those years. Our cities, such as Townsville, Mackay and northern Queensland, and certainly Darwin, Derby and Broome, were under constant attack from Japanese aircraft during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deference to my mother, who brought me out&mdash;the ship we travelled on was subsequently torpedoed on the next trip with the loss of all hands&mdash;one understands, I think, the horror that people with young children faced during those years. Women left their husbands in the war zone. My father had to remain back because he was in Lord Mountbatten's SEAC command in South-East Asia. People did not know if they were going to see their husbands or wives again. That applied in Australia as it applied throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Remembers program, which we are now concluding, gave everybody who participated in any way during those years, whether it was overseas or on the domestic war front, the opportunity to remember and say thank you to those people who made that supreme sacrifice during those years to save their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bradfield, which was a community within the local government area of Ku-ring-gai, had a very proud history in relation to the Second World War because virtually all Air Force personnel trained in Australia went through the Bradfield camp. That camp is no longer there&mdash;CSIRO have most of the land&mdash;but down by the banks of the Lane Cove River to this day, especially after bushfires go through, you can still see the remnants of the open cut trenches and so forth that were dug as part of the training program for those aircraftsmen, and in fact all ranks, that went through at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had other facilities in the area. We had a prison camp for the Italians near St Ives. We had the St Ives showground which, in the early period of the war, were the headquarters of a whole battalion before it was sent overseas. So in a geographic sense there are a whole series of places still in that area which are significant to the war effort. The Bradfield camp in particular is of the greatest significance to the history of the RAAF in Australia. Therefore, on the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Royal Australian Air Force next year we will be establishing an appropriate monument to mark that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As did most other members of the House in their electorates, I established an Australia Remembers Committee in Bradfield. It is most essential that I note in particular the outstanding contribution made towards the program by the members of that committee. I refer specifically to Mrs Alice Penman OAM; Margaret Wyatt, librarian of the Ku-ring-gai Council; Flight Lieutenant Stuart Doyle; Commodore Bryan Wilson; Flight Lieutenant Ron Barber, who is president of the Roseville RSL; Ron Sinclair, who did so much for our entertainment program; former mayor Peter Derwent; Lieutenant Colonel Owen O'Brien; and Mrs Sonya Gatfield and Mrs Leonie Newson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did a number of interesting things. In terms of the schools program, for example, I draw particular attention to the work of the students, the senior students and their teachers of Killara High School, Ravenswood School for Girls, Masada College and the Brigidine College in St Ives, whose students worked so well with the veterans and with other civilian workers during the war in the oral history project which was coordinated by Margaret Wyatt through the Ku-ring-gai library. We now have a sound record, which will ultimately become a written record, of a whole range of people who served both on the home front and overseas but who have been long-time residents of the community. In the context of the schools program, I draw special attention to the work of Tom Peate, who established an essay competition for local schools through the support and good offices of the West Lindfield Bowling Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 10 to 16 July this year, we had a display of memorabilia at the St Ives shopping centre which was organised by Mrs Alice Penman. She served in Palestine from 1941 to 1943 and on her return to Australia served in Queensland. She was ably supported by Mr Pat Reilly and Ms Margaret Middleton, of the St Ives shopping centre, whose outstanding assistance I want to draw particular attention to. The display was beautifully mounted. They put on an excellent cocktail party, where we had the opportunity not only to launch the exhibition of World War II memorabilia at the St Ives shopping village but also to entertain some 200 veterans from the local community. Among those people I give particular prominence to Major H. P. Boland; Major General John Broadbent; Wing Commander Arthur Doubleday; Major General Gordon Maitland; and Major General Sharp. As you can see, Bradfield has a full complement of most senior officers of all three services. Furthermore, we had the full cooperation of the local Ku-ring-gai council, as no doubt most other members did. I want to draw particular attention to the work of Mayor Derwent and his staff throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday 5 August we had what we regarded as our major community event. It was a concert called `Hits of the blitz', and it was held at the University of Technology in Ku-ring-gai. We had two performances and nearly a thousand people attended. The vast majority were former service men and women from the community whom we invited to attend that very excellent concert. In fact, having watched the ABC's performance on TV, I would go so far as to say that ours was immeasurably better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to draw particular attention to and show my appreciation for the outstanding contribution made to that event by the Royal Australian Navy Band under the direction of Lieutenant Tony Younglove, Jillian Donaldson and Slim de-Grey, who no doubt many of you remember. He was a prisoner of war in Changi and has continued over the years to bring the humour&mdash;so far as it is humour associated with the war&mdash;to the attention of succeeding generations. Frankly, on that night he was simply magnificent. I have referred also to Dean Sinclair, but I want to add the contribution of Leslie Martin. We had the Sydney Siders Male Chorus and the Willoughby Symphony Choir. The whole excellent program was compared by the most inimitable Gordon Boyd. It was an outstanding performance which was thoroughly enjoyed by everybody. I will never forget at the end of it, as the soldiers marched down with flags of the major allies of the Second World War, the audience stood up and sung with the greatest gusto possible <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land of Hope and Glory</EMPHASIS>. It would put the proms in London to shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday, 13 August we unveiled and dedicated a remembrance clock on the Pacific Highway, Gordon. This is a tribute from the Bradfield electorate and the people of the Ku-ring-gai municipality. It commemorates the residents who gave their lives in World War II and those who served Australia in all the other ways on the home front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working party for that project consisted of Flight Lieutenant Stuart Doyle; Mr Rod Cook, the council deputy engineer; Ms Alison Walker, the council's landscape architect; and Mr Tim Schwager, the honorary architect. Those involved in the dedication included the mayor, Flight Lieutenant Doyle, the Reverend James Pettigrew of the Church of St John the Evangelist in Gordon, Rabbi David Rogut of the North Shore Synagogue in Lindfield, Reverend Father Harry Davis of Nazareth House, North Turramurra, and me. It is also important to note the work of Robert Newson who provided the clock&mdash;a most important contribution under the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Wednesday, 16 August we launched the Ku-ring-gai During War Exhibition, which was held at the local history centre of the Ku-ring-gai Municipal Council. The council's historian Margaret Wyatt did an excellent job in organising the exhibition which was based on the wartime events in Ku-ring-gai, and I am sure she would want me to thank the literally hundreds of people who made contributions with old photographs, memorabilia, uniforms, badges and so forth to make it such an outstandingly successful event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the project is the recording of the oral testimonies of many returned service men and women and people who served on the domestic front. Many of those interviews have now been recorded. They will be edited and a booklet will be published documenting all aspects of the Ku-ring-gai war scene, especially for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday, 15 September, and later on 9 November, I was involved in the presentation of civilian medals and certificates of appreciation to some hundreds of returned service men and women as well as to people who served on the home front. As has been pointed out by other members, it was fantastic to see people's reactions to this. I was surprised at the number of certificates I was presenting on a posthumous basis; no doubt that was the experience of many of my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 50 years people had assumed that the contribution they had made had just passed through into history. I think that generation will be forever grateful that so many years later those who had been fortunate enough to survive were given the opportunity once again to come forward and accept the support, appreciation and thanks of an entire nation whose peace and tranquillity has been to a large degree assured by the contributions that those men and women made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank in particular the Mayor of Ku-ring-gai, Mayor Geddes, who also participated with me in that project. Overall, it was an extremely successful year for Ku-ring-gai and the electorate of Bradfield, involving many hundreds of people. There is no doubt that many people have come out of this year as happier people because they feel that the contribution they made was worth while and has been appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing of all was the view taken by the RSL Club in Roseville which decided at an early stage that one of the most important components of this year had to be not just the maintenance of memorials or the construction of new memorials but, rather, a program that attracted the youth of Australia to, on the one hand, understand the horrors of war and, on the other, to give through the oral program and by other means the opportunity for that young generation, whose own parents for the most part were too young to service in the Second World War, an appreciation of the significance of those years so that they could pass on traditions for the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first duty I have to fulfil tonight is to a Mrs Valerie Popple from Temora in New South Wales&mdash;not a constituent of mine but someone who has worked particularly hard in recent months on behalf of the pig industry. About three weeks ago she brought to the parliament a petition with 9,143 signatures collected from all over Australia. That petition stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Foreign subsidised imports are crippling Australian agricultural industries and are costing all Australians jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. We require the Australian Government to change the food labelling laws so that foreign imported pork, chicken and other farm produce is labelled as being imported so that we, the Australian consumer can make our own choice.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining time available to me, I want to talk about the electorate of Grey. I have been the sitting member for almost three years and I have been looking at some of the statistics, the history and the breakdown of my electorate. Grey is, of course, one of the 147 seats in this House of the 37th parliament. It is the third largest electorate in the country. I was looking at the electoral atlas this evening before I came into the chamber. It is a wonderful dictionary of information on all the electorates in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first sitting member took his place in 1903. It lists members from a combination FT/ALP/National member right through to Lloyd O'Neil, the ALP member who retired in 1993. There has been a spread of ALP, United Australia Party and Liberal Party members over the history of the seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many people will know, the electorate extends from the Northern Territory border to south of the Clare Valley to the Western Australia border and through to Broken Hill. In that breadth of 895,000 square kilometres there is a population of 130,000 people, 111,000 of whom were born in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comments on the news this evening from the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) when he mentioned that he had attended a League of Rights meeting. Having looked through this electoral atlas, I am very aware of the diversity of this country and I am reminded of Senator Bolkus's decision to strip the Port Lincoln Mayor, Peter Davis, of his right to officiate at naturalisation ceremonies. The member for Eden-Monaro touched on that diversity in his comments about Graeme Campbell, the member for Kalgoorlie. When I look at Grey I see a part of Australia&mdash;not unlike Kalgoorlie, not unlike much of rural Australia&mdash;which is growing further apart from urban Australia in many ways. It is an issue that we will need to address and I note that the Labor Party is going through some pains over that currently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise the issue this evening of funding political parties and, in particular, refer to an article in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> by Laurie Oakes headed, `Liberal view of the truth'. We have had a situation in the past where quite a number of creative arrangements have been adopted by the conservative parties to disguise the origins of donors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Catch Tim being one of the major examples in South Australia, with $100,000 donated through a Hong Kong company. We also had the situation where the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), had an FAI funded staff member and the honourable member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), when shadow minister for industrial relations, had a consultancy with Clayton Utz, a major industrial relations law firm&mdash;and he still has that in his list of declarations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Free Enterprise Foundation&mdash;which is very effectively revealed in the article by Mr Oakes&mdash;prior to the last election contributing something like $7 million to the Liberal Party campaign funds. Under the Electoral Act as it then stood, the origin of those funds could not be disclosed. In the article, Mr Oakes shows that $25,000 of that money came from a CSR donation to the Free Enterprise Foundation, in spite of the fact that when the Australian Labor Party approached CSR for a donation, the secretary of the Labor Party received the response that it was CSR policy `not to make donations to political parties'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do have a significant problem in this country. I am pleased to see that the government is in the process of amending the Electoral Act to close the loophole that allows such things as the Free Enterprise Foundation rort to continue and to ensure that donations made to a person or body with the aim of benefiting a political party are deemed to be donations to that party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what is going on in Victorian politics at the moment with the Walker-Williams-Kennett troika through the casino and the rorted tendering process; various matters associated with Hudson Conway; the grand prix and the laws associated with the grand prix; and the fact that Ronald Walker is basically the Liberal Party bagman. You have a very unhealthy integration of very major commercial activities and political party funding in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding of political parties, unfortunately, seems to be a bit like the tax avoidance industry&mdash;no sooner does the government alter the legislation than people on the conservative side of the fence start looking for more loopholes to get funny money of some description, or money that they do not want to disclose the origin of, into their campaign funds. The latest means of doing this is the clandestine corporate sponsorship or funding of staff members of coalition MPs. The classic example being FAI and the honourable member for Mackellar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently heard that new version of this practice is emerging&mdash;a much more sophisticated arrangement than the FAI-member for Mackellar arrangement. A company simply `tops up' the salary of a Liberal staffer with an undisclosed amount, for undisclosed reasons. I am unable to verify this information at this stage, but it has been suggested to me that there is at least one instance where this has occurred in the office of a very senior figure in the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on both the government and the opposition to clarify the situation on this issue. It seems that even the new amendments to the Electoral Act may not cover this situation, as the donation could be described as not benefiting a political party, but rather the individual staffer who receives the `top up' to their salary, and of course benefiting the individual company that has made the donation or the additional salary payment without disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore ask: have there been any instances in this House of this occurring, where staffers have had their salaries `topped up' by private companies? Will disclosure of this practice be required under the new legislation? If not, will the government give serious consideration to requiring disclosure of such donations under the act?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold up the latest copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Herald</EMPHASIS>, the Bourke paper, with the headline, `Law and Order in Bourke in disarray' and the sub-heading, `Juveniles hold the town to ransom!'

This Labor government has rigidly adhered to its commitment to regularly index pensions and, in addition, has delivered on its promise to ensure that pensions are at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is important to understand that this is a principle which is not accepted by those on the other side. If the policy that applied when the other side were in government were applied now, single age pensioners would at least be $20 a week worse off and couples would be at least $34 a week worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we have is that the record of the opposition in government is dreadful. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), when he was Treasurer in the Fraser government, stopped the regular indexation of pensions. If Mr Howard had the opportunity to repeat this trick it would cost the average pensioner one whole week's pension per year. That would be the equivalent of a pensioner being robbed after they went to the bank and withdrew their pension on a weekly basis. During the Fraser-Howard government, pensions fell by 2 per cent in real terms because they did not make increases in line with changes to the CPI. Under this government, pensions have increased 14 per cent in real terms and have increased at a rate greater than the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that it is hard to live on a pension. That is why I believe it is vital that the existing commitments are maintained and the advances of the past are not lost. This will not be possible under a Liberal government. The Leader of the Opposition made it very clear on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> earlier this week that they do not have a commitment to maintaining and increasing the real value of pensions over time. In my electorate of Lilley, the Liberal candidate has blamed our national debt on the money being paid to pensioners and the unemployed. Quite clearly, she believes that to solve national debt pensions should be cut. This is an approach which is totally rejected by those on this side of the House. We have a policy of maintaining and increasing the real value of pensions. We have a record of doing that. That is not the case with the Leader of the Opposition or the Liberal Party. </PARA>

I will lay London to a brick that in the past seven years the member for Parkes has not said a single word about the Fahey government slashing police numbers in New South Wales. He knows too well that the Carr government already has embarked on building up police numbers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday when this House considered private members business we heard about the Pacific Highway in New South Wales. The Pacific Highway bisects my electorate, the electorate of Paterson. Today that discussion has continued. Senator Tierney has set new parameters for the role of a senator. He is not a senator representing New South Wales; he is a senator representing the Hunter&mdash;a completely new classification of a senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is Senator Tierney saying about the Pacific Highway? He is saying that the black spot funding has been cut. He alludes to the fact that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) says they are going to bring it back. I am not sure what speech he was reading of the Leader of the National Party when he claims they are going to bring it back, because I can tell the House that when the Leader of the National Party addressed the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation earlier this year he said that the coalition will not be increasing funding on rural and regional roads because they don't want to compete for the dollar; they don't want to risk increasing interest rates. You can quote verbatim virtually anything the opposition have said because they have said it. But when you cross-reference it you find out that what they said at a certain meeting in Yass conflicts with what they said at a meeting in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne. They have said everything. </PARA>

In its first year in office the Carr government will spend $108 million&mdash;an increase of some 30-odd per cent. Those are the facts. If we want to know what the Fahey government did in the first year of having road funding come to them in an untied form&mdash;everyone knows that last year was the first year of that system following an agreement between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and Nick Greiner, when he was the Premier&mdash;we have to ask: where did the first $50 million of road funding go?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to speak very briefly about two tragedies&mdash;one a domestic tragedy and one an overseas tragedy. As patron of the Toowoomba Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME) Support Group, I am disappointed at the reluctance of many at the medical and political levels to accept the plight of Australians afflicted with this debilitating condition. At this point in time, it seems to me that deeply traditional medical attitudes prevail that this is a condition of the mind rather than of the body. Having met with many in the local support group this year, and having talked to overseas medical experts from the United Kingdom and New Zealand recently, it is clear that Australia is lagging behind overseas medical and governmental acceptance and remedial health and budgetary measures to correct this debilitating condition. Once again, on behalf of local support group president, Joan Sheath, and all CFS sufferers nationwide, I make a special plea to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and to health research authorities to do something about this as a matter of urgency in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning overseas, there is no doubt that the civil war in Sri Lanka is a tragedy of the highest order. Indeed, there is no humanitarian crisis within our Commonwealth of Nations of comparable magnitude. There is, therefore, a desperate need to resolve it for all Sri Lankans&mdash;Tamil and Sinhalese alike&mdash;irrespective of religion, of ethnic identity or political allegiance. It is a tragedy that the overwhelming number of victims are civilians of all views who have been brought into the military conflict by the indiscriminate use of violence. In particular, there is a need to address the displacement of about half a million persons in the country's north who are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, UN Secretary-General Boutros Ghali has declared an urgent need for international humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of these people&mdash;regrettably, to little tangible effect at this point. In that context, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) called on our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) several weeks ago to raise the problem of Sri Lanka during the recent CHOGM in New Zealand and to discuss with other Commonwealth members ways in which the Commonwealth could play a useful role in resolving this tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, not only was the matter of Sri Lanka not included in the CHOGM communique but the issue was not discussed in any formal way at that meeting. The coalition, therefore, has criticised and will continue to criticise the government's failure until we see a substantive response. To date, our Prime Minister has refused to explain why he failed to raise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all be appalled also at Senator Evans's reference in the Senate earlier this year to the concerns of the Australian Tamil community as being concerns of `a few romantically minded' Tamils in this country. Clearly, that is not so, and I feel sure that the Sinhala Cultural Foundation would have strong views also. His failure to recognise the issue and the failure of the Prime Minister to raise the issue at CHOGM represent extraordinary oversights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the moral rhetoric which flowed in other directions from CHOGM, it is incomprehensible that the Sri Lankan tragedy was overlooked. The coalition supports the need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Sri Lanka as a matter of urgency. We believe that there should be some international involvement in the situation, despite persistent Sri Lankan government rejection of this. Australia might play a useful role both diplomatically and politically and in coordinating efforts by non-government organisations in sending relief supplies, particularly basic medicines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, time is running out and thousands of people are dying each day unnecessarily in this tragedy. We all should abhor atrocities and violence both by the Tamil Tigers and by Sri Lankan government forces alike. Once again, I call on the Keating government to take genuine steps to help alleviate that crisis and to return all Sri Lankans to a state of normality, of tolerance, of self-respect and peace, free of suggestions of ethnic cleansing and with all the freedoms of responsible democracy. Clearly, Sri Lanka has a long way to go to reach these goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need the Prime Minister and Senator Evans to light the Commonwealth's way towards a new Sri Lanka, where the gun is no longer needed and where peoples of all ethnic and religious groupings can live in peace and mutual prosperity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report that is the subject of our discussion this morning is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf: Efficiency of the interface between seaports and land transport: Final report</EMPHASIS>. This is the result of the efforts of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which I am a member, more particularly for the aviation safety inquiry aspects of the committee's undertakings though I am also interested in this particular aspect of the committee's work. In particular, I would like to mention that my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur, has undertaken a great deal of work on this committee report. The purpose of the report is to do something that has been neglected in Australia's transport infrastructure over the years, and that is to ensure that there is a proper interface, a proper link, between all aspects of transport in Australia to ensure that we remove the hurdles of inefficiency that exist today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anybody looks at our transport infrastructure, they should look at it in its entirety rather than in the particularity. For example, people tend to think of road transport and only of road transport, or they think of rail transport and only of rail transport, or they think of shipping and only of the waterfront. People do not look at the entire problem of moving goods from the point of production to the point of consumption or from the point of import to the point of consumption here in Australia. They do not look at the entire interface and try to establish a seamless process by which goods are transported in Australia. As a consequence we in Australia have developed over the years a disjointed transport infrastructure where the interface has not been properly developed. As a consequence of that, inefficiencies have been built into the system, which lead to higher costs, which lead to our inability to compete satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophy behind this report, as I am sure the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the chairman of the committee, will state more extensively in his remarks, which will follow mine, is to look at a seamless transport infrastructure in Australia removing the hurdles of inefficiency that have been developed over the years by governments that have not looked at transport as an overall industry but have looked at particular aspects of transport without linking them together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront is one of the most obvious and concerning aspects of Australia's transport infrastructure. Nearly everything that is imported into Australia comes through our ports. A very small component of our total imports comes via air freight but 99 per cent comes through our waterfront. As a consequence, the waterfront is a key component in Australia's transport infrastructure. As the report points out, the performance of our waterfront, historically as well as currently, is not up to the standard that people would like, and therefore the need to ensure that we have a more efficient waterfront is paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various graphs and tables in the report, one of which highlights the waterfront performance here in Australia. It points out that there were some improvements during the latter period of the waterfront reform process. This particular table is table 2 on page 29, headed `Stevedoring performance indicators: Five major ports December 1989-June 1995'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there was an improvement in crane rates, elapsed rate and net rate, all of the figures here would indicate that that has started to tail off over recent times. That is of course reflected in anecdotal evidence, as well as more authoritative evidence from organisations such as the Bureau of Industry Economics. The bureau's report, which came down only recently, indicates very serious concern about the deteriorating performance on our Australian waterfront. That is after an improved performance towards the latter period of the waterfront reform program that concluded in October 1992. There is no doubt, I think, from the committee's report and from other anecdotal and more authoritative reports, that our waterfront is not performing nearly as well as it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, anybody who has been reading the newspapers in the last two or three weeks will be aware of the fact that we have had a major nationwide waterfront dispute. This reinforces the view that many of us have&mdash;not necessarily shared by all people in the parliament but certainly shared by a lot of people in the parliament&mdash;that the waterfront has not really changed its spots. One of the great hopes of waterfront reform would be that the culture on the waterfront would change so that we would see a more reliable waterfront, a waterfront that would be enterprise focused rather than industry focused, and a waterfront that would not see itself as the storm-troopers or the shock-troopers of industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also hope that reform would mean that, whenever there was some sort of an industrial dispute going on, the waterfront would not be automatically wheeled out to go on strike as part of an overall industrial campaign that may have absolutely no relevance to the waterfront but which would be used by the ACTU as a vehicle to try to influence public opinion or government actions to change some aspect of industrial relations unrelated to the waterfront. The waterfront is used as sort of a shock treatment to achieve success for the ACTU. The recent strike has proven that the spots have not changed on the creature at the waterfront, the Maritime Union of Australia. It is still the old organisation it always was. The culture is very much the same as it always was. In my view, the recent strike on the waterfront marks the grave for waterfront reform in Australia. However, I am sure members on the opposite side will take a somewhat different view to that. I guess they have to do that because the waterfront union, the Maritime Union of Australia, is very much an integral part, an icon, of the Labor movement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had much difficulty trying to sell ANL, which any reasonable person would say is something that should have been done a long time ago. Indeed, the government did try to sell ANL in 1991, and it has been consistently trying to sell it since. The fact that the government has not been able to sell it indicates the power that the Maritime Union of Australia has over the government. That will be evident for all to see tomorrow when the government admits defeat on its attempts to sell ANL. We will then see the Maritime Union of Australia claiming a great victory over government policy and public interest. That is the waterfront aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also deals with aspects of rail&mdash;for example, the National Rail Corporation, an organisation that was established by the government in 1991. The then minister, the member for Charlton, Bob Brown, initiated those changes. Of course, all of us who have an interest in transport welcomed the establishment of the National Rail Corporation and genuinely want the National Rail Corporation to succeed. Many people would say that it is not a matter of wanting National Rail to succeed; it is a matter of making it absolutely essential for Australia's transport that it does succeed. However, from evidence that the report highlights, the National Rail Corporation is not succeeding to the degree that people would like it to, and the report refers to that. Also, those of us with an interest in transport would have picked up anecdotal evidence from freight forwarders and customers of National Rail that the performance of National Rail leaves a lot to be desired, that it has not achieved a level of performance that would satisfy customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity to talk with other rail operators when I chaired a session of the World Freight Congress in Melbourne recently in which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) was also involved. I happened to chair the session on state rail authorities at which all of the participants were quite critical of the National Rail Corporation for not performing, for not meeting the sorts of standards that are necessary to satisfy customers today and for not ensuring that Australia has a modern, efficient, performance oriented National Rail Corporation. There is a lot of room for improvement with the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area in which the corporation is very successful is public relations. All credit is due to Fred Affleck for achieving a very good public relations campaign for National Rail Corporation. That campaign is probably a darn site better than its performance on the rail track but there is a need for National Rail Corporation to be improving its performance, and the report highlights that. I hope that the National Rail Corporation will recognise the need to improve its services and be more customer oriented, more performance oriented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people would say it still suffers from a culture that is a leftover from the days of rail being operated by government when, if you did not like using that particular rail service, bad luck; there was only one of them. If you did not do business with that rail corporation, then you would not do business on rail. I think we need to have more private sector competition on the rail system to keep organisations like the National Rail Corporation honest. Indeed, I hope we will have that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the report is port authorities. A comparison of port authority performance in Australia with port authority performance around the world would indicate that our costs and service levels do not compare with those of our trading nations. Although there has been reform in our port authorities over recent years and that reform is ongoing, we are still not competitive against those nations that we need to compete against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People would also recognise that state governments, which are the owners of port authorities, use port authorities as a way of raising non-tax revenue. That is not healthy for the Australian economy. If we are to have an efficient waterfront, there are two sides to the coin: stevedoring and port authorities. The performance of port authorities can be just as important as the performance of the stevedoring operation at those ports. We need to spend more time focusing on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to inject a degree of competition into our ports. That is a difficult thing to achieve, given the geography of Australia, but involving the private sector more and more in the functions of port authorities to the point of moving down the path of privatisation of some of them is a way in which Australia can look forward to improved performance from our ports and to the removal of the temptation that state governments fall victim to of using port authorities as a way of raising non-tax revenue. Moving towards the private sector is one way of helping to achieve that. Port authorities are an integral part of the process and the report highlights that, as it also highlights the poor performance of our port authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that the report deals with is the need to have proper road links from our ports, from our rail stations and depots, to the manufacturing and consuming areas. There are some very substandard roads servicing our major ports. For example, I do not think that the port of Botany is adequately linked by road to the areas of production in Sydney. Most of the goods coming into the port of Sydney or that go out of the port of Sydney at Port Botany are manufactured or processed in the western suburbs of Sydney. The road links from the port at Botany to the western suburbs of Sydney are not up to the standard that they ought to be. The report makes the point that a proper warehouse to wharf approach would need to include the establishment of a good road system to those ports, to our airports, to our rail depots, to ensure that we have that. I would like to congratulate the committee&mdash;its chairman and members&mdash;on a job well done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> targeted the efficiency of the interface between sea ports and land transport, following a report in 1992 that highlighted some of the problems in that area of our transport system. This matter is very important to my home state of Tasmania, as most of our bulk goods have to be subjected to sea passage, and it is of some consequence if significant delays mean that we cannot get them where we want them as quickly as we would like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry revealed, as the preface says, `an appalling apathy, ignorance and inertia on the part of users of waterfront services'. The committee in 1992 found that providers of transport were largely self-interested, and talked about each other rather than to each other. The report shows that little has changed since then. Despite everybody clamouring for better services, it appears that many traders have very little knowledge of how to use the port services. Waterfront productivity is important, yet efficiency and efficient use of transport services in the waterfront is even more important to exporters, importers and Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some minor improvements since 1992, and the committee found that coordination and communication have improved among some parties in the transport chain on the waterfront. Vehicle booking schemes have been implemented and there is a more coordinated approach in promoting electronic commerce; but that, in itself, is taking some time to get in place, and I would like to mention that matter again a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still problems with truck queues, late deliveries of cargo, documentation, and a mishmash of working hours between warehouse and wharf operators. The latter problem means that cargoes can be left on the dock. If the goods are in any way perishable, this can cause a major disaster. If somebody from the wharf is delivering something to a warehouse but the warehouse does not open or else restricts its opening time and its hours of opening, it makes it very difficult for that person to make deliveries to fit in with their overall schedules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A manufacturer can make a widget and that widget can be placed in a piece of machinery which is sold to a wholesaler and then to a customer. If that widget fails and the machine breaks down, not only can the original manufacturer replace the widget but they can also trace where, and on which day, the widget was made, and by whom and on which machine. That is today's world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such is the advantage of a total quality management tracking system. Problems can be checked and sourced, so that they are not repeated. Yet we have in Australia a freight system such that, once a package or a container leaves the company of origin, no-one seems to have any idea of where it is in the system until it actually arrives. That is where the electronic system should be able to assist us in improving our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving away from the report, not very long ago I had a function in Canberra for which I decided to ship up some Tasmanian wine, which is always a pleasant thing to do. The company duly sent off the consignment to me a couple of weeks before the date of the function. The day before the function the consignment had not arrived. I asked my staff to check on the whereabouts of the consignment, but the company could not find out where the assignment had gone. The company could not say whether the consignment was on the wharf in Melbourne, whether it had left Tasmania or whether it was on a train waiting to come to Canberra. No-one knew. I was quite surprised that, within the system today&mdash;and given the work I have done on this committee&mdash;we could not find out where in the chain something had gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fine state of affairs exists when a customer is waiting for a particular product for a particular day and no-one can tell the customer when, where or if it will arrive. This situation is not good enough and we need to get on top of the problem. In the end I got my wine, but it arrived the day after I wanted it. I was lucky that I had someone to substitute the wine with other wine, but the situation is not good enough and it needs to be improved. Of course, in my own state of Tasmania, the situation becomes  terrible. Australia relies on efficient freight systems, and I believe that there is a task force looking at freight systems in Australia. The findings of the task force are crucial to our success in proving our exporting system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, one of the things that came out during the committee's hearings is the fact that our computer software systems are not up to scratch and that there needs to be a lot of work done to try to work out better schemes and systems. It certainly would be worthwhile to look at the TQM models to see if some of the ideas can be implemented. One of the recommendations in the report is for the government to provide funds for a detailed assessment of the current environment of software development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a need to seriously promote efficiency among banks and shipping companies, and this is a crucial point. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), gave the wharfies another kick. It is a case of `bash a wharfie', instead of looking at where the problems really are. Failure to look at the problems is one of the major reasons why efficiency in this area is being held back. The banks and the shipping companies must take formal responsibility for promoting greater use of sea waybills. Sea waybills are, of course, a simpler alternative system of documentation than the present system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also has a role in initiating alternatives to international trade and financial documentation, and I believe that the government will take on this responsibility. It is mentioned in the report that it is only in recent times that the government has played a role in trade at the international level by endeavouring to bring together more of this information on an international scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why can we not have standard import and export documentation introduced at all ports around Australia? I am sure that this can happen if there is a will to push to make it happen. The standing committee looked at other reports, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, and noted the skulduggery that goes on in world shipping. There are some very bad companies in existence in the world as far as their use of ships is concerned. Given the poor standard of some ships which are in use, these companies seem to have an interest in running their companies inefficiently and ineffectively. Maybe this situation also has something to do with the type of documentation used. Decent companies which operate their businesses in a transparent way should flourish if we get appropriate documentation systems in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to develop some performance indicators to give us some idea of how our ports are performing, so that we can find out which are our good, efficient ports, and which ones need assistance to come up to scratch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our transport systems are vital&mdash;not just the ports but our rail system as well. National Rail was reconstructed in February 1993, and has been taking over the commercial responsibilities for operating intermodal terminals, line haulage operations, account marketing and the financial arrangements for invoicing and collecting revenue from these activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our inquiries we heard on a number of occasions that the services provided by National Rail were not meeting the requirements of all its customers. Others have said that they have been reasonably okay. `Reasonably okay' does not give you a very high tick. This is another area where we are moving in the right direction, but there is plenty of potential to improve the service and its reliability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember being at Port Botany and looking at the lack of connections between the rail service and the port. There is a need to link that port to the interstate rail service that now operates around Australia&mdash;that is, getting it out of the metropolitan Sydney system, so that you can get a line from your ports and quick access out on to your bigger system to carry you to other parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), again vented his anger on the wharfies, making them the main issue of concern, whereas I believe that there is a much broader debate concerning the policy changes needed to bring about a more efficient transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our report argues that the commercial use of EDI, electronic data interchange, in the transport chain would improve things a lot. We also suggested that the shipping and banking industries should accept formal responsibility for promoting the greater use of sea waybills and simpler alternative documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been promoting these areas for some time. One of the major problems has been the attitude of the banking industry towards the greater use of sea waybills. Banks have negatively portrayed sea waybills as offering inadequate documentation, and have failed to promote the quick releases that can apply under this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the banks must look after their clients, and that they have some concerns regarding ownership of cargo. But in today's world, most of the concerns that the banks have can be overcome.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to speak on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf: Final report</EMPHASIS> in view of the very important issues involved in the report. Firstly, I acknowledge the role of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the member for Shortland, Peter Morris, for his understanding of the issues, his capacity to identify the key arguments and his genuine concern about the role of the waterfront and the participation by those users of rail, road and other operators who connect to the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Committee members were enlightened and encouraged by visits to Container Terminals Australia, Australian Stevedores, National Rail Corporation at Chullora freight terminal in Sydney, South Dynon freight terminal in Melbourne and the port of Geelong. Those visits gave the committee and individual members a clear insight as to the problems on the ground and led to some valuable discussions that brought about the final report. The waterfront, in a public sense, is the villain of the piece in terms of the arguments about the export and import of Australian freight. People can identify with the industrial relations problems, the long history of confrontation at the waterfront, the management and now the technical changes that are taking place, the monopoly position that historically had been enjoyed by those people working on the waterfront and, of course, the identification by political parties and politicians of the suggestion that, if only we could fix up the waterfront, then all our problems would be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I make the observation that there are a number of other more complicated factors in relation to the movement of freight from the ships to the warehouse, and the report addresses some of those issues in an attempt to improve the efficiency of the transport of goods. It is the sea-land interface that the report identifies that is so important in improving the movement of goods rather than just identifying the movement from the ship to the waterfront and letting the containers or the goods stay at that location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee identified the self-interest of the service providers&mdash;the port authorities, the rail handlers and the road handlers&mdash;as being uncooperative because of their concern for their part of the chain of the operation. Likewise, the exporters and importers were concerned with only their responsibility in the operation and there seemed to be little cooperation in trying to improve the total system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had some reports on electronic data information in terms of Customs and the AQIS performance and we would be hoping that that would improve. The vehicle booking system provided some interesting problems on the basis that there was not encouragement for people to be in the queues or to get in a vehicle booking system. With the integrated handling there was not good cooperation between the various parties. The committee noted that the Australian Wheat Board and BHP had been able to obtain better working conditions on handling of their particular goods through designated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee spent a fair bit of time looking at the vehicle booking system and it seemed a very sensible way to operate that trucks that arrived at the waterfront or the port authority area should have a system whereby they did not spend most of the day in a queue. It came to our attention that this was commercially advantageous, that a person would be paid demurrage if they were standing in a queue and not wearing their truck out driving around the metropolitan area. That vehicle booking system seemed to work quite well, reducing the time from almost days to 40 minutes. Now the time is down to 20 minutes and people can book with some confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of working hours, there were quite clearly evident difficulties in that the waterfronts regard themselves as a 24-hour operation, whereas the warehouses have an attitude of mind that they are open eight hours. Obviously there is a conflict between those two positions. There are peaks in the loading of ships at the waterfront, and if the warehouses are only open eight hours that exacerbates the problem. We would suggest that there be a change of attitude and more cooperation in those hours. For instance, it was brought to our attention that there is late delivery of containers&mdash;25 per cent of exporters delivered in the last 24 hours for one particular shipment&mdash;which makes it very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw evidence of the interface councils which the committee recommends being a very helpful advantage. In Melbourne, the facilitation committee gets some cooperation between all the port users under the direction of the port of Melbourne, and the evidence was that that was working well. There was progress towards a more efficient system. I think the committee was encouraged by the public hearing in October 1995, where a number of the port users and players were involved and our chairman encouraged the participants to put a point of view. That in itself helped to generate a cooperative attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the electronic data interchange. The problems we identified were the cost of the system and the compatibility of the various systems of government and private users. Some of us had a bit of difficulty in understanding the ramifications of the sea waybills and bills of lading. It seems that these systems go back to the days of Nelson and there has been very little change in the way in which this documentation process is undertaken, both internationally and here in Australia. We noted the role of the banks, and some of us were a little concerned that the banks did not play a positive role in ensuring that the payment for and exchange of goods were done in the best possible manner. We also observed that in terms of air freight these arrangements seemed to be much more efficient. In terms of the waterfront performance, the committee was encouraged by the publication of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterline</EMPHASIS>, which gives some definitive information on the movements of containers and gives some benchmarking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the role of the National Rail Authority, National Rail as it is now known, in terms of movement of goods between the state capitals. In my view, the connection of the standard gauge, completed in May 1995, was a major event in the transport history of Australia. The standard gauge was going to be implemented in 1923, I understand, and it was finally done in 1995. I think the significance of this event has been overlooked by the people of Australia, that we now have the ability to move containers and goods from Perth to Brisbane on one standard track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the important thing from the warehouse to wharf perspective is that containers can be moved from the major ports of Melbourne and Sydney to Adelaide or to Brisbane or vice versa according to the shipments and the schedules. None of us needs to underestimate the impact of that national gauge link in the next 10 years, where containers can be moved efficiently, effectively and in a timely fashion. For instance, they can leave Melbourne at 6 p.m. and arrive in Adelaide at 7 a.m. ready for delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the port charges, the committee notes the state governments' levying of charges in the ports without due consideration to the importance of port facilitation for importers and exporters. For instance, in New South Wales the Maritime Services Board extracted $89.5 million from a total income of $91 million from that particular source, which clearly demonstrates the state government's attitude that they regarded that as a tax gatherer rather than the port of Sydney being a facilitator for exporters and importers. The dividend versus the port facilitation remains a fundamental argument. I just make the observation that the privatisation that has taken place in Victoria in the ports of Portland and Geelong, provided there is not a monopoly position and provided there is genuine competition, may assist with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the stevedoring argument, which provides a lot of heat and argument, I note the figures given on page 28 where the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The BIE's 1995 report quotes world best practice container crane rates of 30 moves per hour at Singapore and Hong Kong. Ports of more comparable size to the larger Australian ports, such as Felixstowe, Baltimore, Thamesport, Barcelona, Zeebrugge and Kobe, all achieved crane rates in the range 25 to 29 moves per hour. The BIE reported that these rates compare with 15 to 18.5 moves per hour at Australian ports.</PARA>
<PARA>Could I just suggest that we need to be very careful about these comparisons. I have observed the port of Singapore where there is quite massive investment and quite remarkable movements of tonnages and containers without any consideration of onward moves from portside to rail and road traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there has been somewhat too much concentration on the ability of container moves, rather than the aspects that this report addresses, that is, labour productivity and moving the containers from portside back into the transport chain. I think that, disregarding those movements, we should be looking at whether there is genuine competition between the last two stevedore companies&mdash;whether they have more than a cosy monopoly position or whether there is genuine competition between those two stevedores on the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning the decline of their performance, we note that in October 1995 the container movements were 18.9 per hour, whereas in September 1992 there were 20.1 per hour, and that compares to the 30 moves in Singapore and Hong Kong. I do not take too much recognition of those factors because there has been a considerable capital investment in the ports for container movements. Vast amounts of money are required for the container cranes and the general layout of these container ports. Hopefully, the capital investment by the two stevedores will enhance the port performance and, more importantly, the industrial relations arrangements&mdash;annualising the salaries, improving the productivity, changing the historical industrial relations attitudes at the Australian waterfront and encouraging productivity with the new mechanised equipment&mdash;will help the whole waterfront arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to say that this is a first-class report. We have spoken to most of the key players in the waterfront freight area and I hope that future governments will take into account the recommendations, that people will have a more cooperative attitude towards the movement of freight from the wharfside to the warehouse, and that, little by little, improvements are made. These things do not improve overnight in terms of dramatic changes in technology or attitude, but the recommendations that we have here all warrant careful attention by the user groups. If we could only bring about a change of attitude by those people who are close to the waterfront that would be a key result, as the chairman acknowledges, in producing a better performance by the users of the waterfront and associated facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not going to be achieved with some dramatic political decision. It will be this change of attitude and a desire to improve that will help the export and import performance of all those people associated with the waterfront&mdash;be they the rail users, the transport operators, the truck drivers or the waterfront workers. I commend the report to the House and again acknowledge the great contribution of the chairman to the whole debate, both in his term as minister and as chairman of this committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first report of the committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS>, was tabled in April l992. As we said at the time, it highlighted the benefits that could be obtained if Australian firms were to make better use of the transport chain from the warehouse to the wharf. We specifically called the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> because much of the need for reform is within the operation of the warehouses themselves&mdash;the broader question of logistics, how one organises the activities of the warehouse and how one organises all of the operations of all of the links to shipside. It is that last segment where the waterfront itself comes in, but there is an absolute resistance on the part of warehouse operators and users of waterfront services to even consider how they could better utilise the chain. </PARA>

Waterfronts operate 24 hours, virtually every day of the year, yet in Sydney, particularly, warehouses operate less than office hours, Monday to Friday. In fact, we found in the original inquiry that, in some cases, they stipulate the hours&mdash;cargo would only be received between the hours of noon and 2.00 p.m. That puts enormous strain upon a transport system to fit into that narrow slot and it brings with it a host of inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the original inquiry and through our subsequent inquiry during the term of this parliament, we have been trying to change the culture. As my Deputy Chairman, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), said a few moments ago, the culture and the attitude must change. It is not so much a matter of the infrastructure not being there; it is a matter of using the infrastructure more efficiently. For that to happen, the attitudes of the users of that infrastructure and the users of those services have to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could not find anybody to appear before our forum on October 13 in Sydney. We could not find anybody who was a real life importer or exporter on a small to medium scale. The industry associations are like sloganeers on how bad the waterfront is. We said to them, `Please, identify for us an individual exporter or importer who is having difficulty so that the committee can address their specific problems and see if we can use that as a model for other importers and exporters to follow.' The ultimate result was that they said, `Sorry, we cannot find anybody.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can find many columns of comment about the waterfront. There is an attitude from some people that it is easier to complain about somebody than it is for them to look at their own operations to see how they can better fit in as links in the chain and make the whole system work better. That attitudinal change is resistant: it is not new; it has been there, to my knowledge, since the early 1980s. It was l984 when the Inter-State Commission first looked publicly at this whole process, and the problems of attitude were there then and the inefficiencies were then. I am sorry to say, as my deputy chairman has also mentioned, that nothing much has changed. It is pretty much business as it was back in the 1980s. It is pretty much rhetoric as it was back in the 1980s. Australia loses, severely, out of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the individual small to medium exporters the transport costs are not a priority. They are something like two per cent or three per cent of the total cost of getting the product to their customer&mdash;that is, cost of the manufacturing and everything else that goes with it. But when we, as a nation, take those costs collectively they are a very important factor in improving our international competitiveness. The challenge that we have had as a committee, and the challenge that this nation has, is how we get those individual exporters and importers to think and act with some regard to national interest rather than their own simple interests as exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that remains unaddressed to a large extent is the outdated financial documentary practices. The forms have not changed much. The deputy chairman referred to Nelson; it actually goes back to Captain Cook. The bill of lading that controls the passage of freight through our ports was designed in 1767. The designer of that form really deserves a bicentenary award. More than two centuries later, that form has outlasted all practice, all technology, and 40 per cent of the cargo going through our ports is still on bills of lading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aviation, on the other hand, does not have any baggage of history: there are no age-long traditions and practices, smoke filled boardrooms, port wine and cigars to go with aviation; it is much leaner and meaner. Aviation uses waybills, delivery dockets that enable the possession of the cargo to be passed on. In shipping, bills of ladings were used at the time Captain Cook set sail&mdash;as detailed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">London Gazette</EMPHASIS> of 25 August 1768&mdash;to list not only the possession of the cargo but the title to the cargo. In the same way as banks still have the practice of wanting to sight the original documents, the bill of lading must be sighted so that the possession of the cargo and ownership of the cargo pass at the same time. This practice has to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had witnesses before our committee in Sydney on 13 October who were not particularly concerned. They said it was a matter of decision by the customers whether they use a bill of lading or a sea waybill, which is the equivalent of the air waybill. It is simply a delivery docket that passes possession of the cargo but not the title to ownership of the cargo. That issue we have to hammer away at. It can change; it must change so we can streamline the movement of that cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of why anyone wants a bill of lading, those witnesses want a bill of lading for ownership, a title. We want sea waybills used more extensively for speeding the flow of cargo through so that we can try and even out the movement of cargo through ports. One of the problems with the stevedoring operators is that they get peaks and troughs. Cargoes for export invariably arrive late. Twenty-five per cent of cargo arriving at Conaust terminal in Port Botany, we were told, arrives on the last day, but they can start delivering cargo onto the wharf for export up to in some cases five days&mdash;but at least three days&mdash;before ship sail time. If the cargo comes in evenly, there is a better utilisation of equipment, a smoother operation of equipment, and hours and costs are more evenly spread. When 25 per cent suddenly arrives on the last day and the rest has been held up, in come the inefficiencies. The inefficiencies are very much generated by the exporters themselves. When we look to how we can make more efficient use of the waterfront, it is this chain of events that has to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended back in April 1992 that consultative groups comprising the users of waterfront services as well as the providers of waterfront services be established. We called them `interface efficiency councils' so that all the parties involved in the chain, people at very senior level, could sit around the table and whatever decisions were taken around that table would be implemented. That grouping, those discussions, could all work together in coordinating and smoothing that process so we get the maximum efficiency in Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Department of Transport at the time passed our recommendation on to the ports. The port authorities, quite obviously, thought, `This is our territory. What are you doing sticking your nose into our territory? We know how best to run the ports.' They do not and they will not. That is the problem. It is true that the Port of Melbourne Authority has done some work and is trying to do something. A lot more could be done, but one has to commend it for the progress that it has made since 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the port of Fremantle, they have a port liaison task force that has very wide representation. It meets regularly and is headed by Captain David Clarke. They have a troubleshooter and there is a large degree of education of the users of the port so that the users of the port come to understand why it is important to have cargo there early, why it is important to have the documents there ready when the ship arrives and why it is important to timetable the use of road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The users of the road transport and the users of transport to the waterfront can get a better deal for small to medium businesses if they know how the system works, but very few of them have any idea how the system works. What is sad about that is they have not, in the past 3 1/2 years, tried to find out anything about it. We could not get a live exporter to talk to the committee when we had our forum in Sydney on 13 October. We must press on with this. The support of the parliament for the recommendations of the report will have to be persistent. It has been and it must continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the role of ports. I mentioned port authorities in the context of helping to organise the groups. We have re-recommended the establishment of interface efficiency councils. Had they been established, a lot more would have been achieved, so we have recommended that again. Could I say that, if the port authorities do not want to convene them, it does not matter; it is probably better that they do not. The users of the port should do it themselves; it does not have to be the port authorities. The users of the port service could convene a meeting and get on with the job of making the whole system work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter concerns electronic data interchange: the use of electronic messaging in the transfer of information to enable cargo to be moved. That is a task that was undertaken initially by the Australian Customs Service, and the Australian Customs Service is the one common link to all of this. There has to be customs clearance coming in and customs clearance going out. It has played a prime role in the introduction of electronic messaging. It and AQIS have both been very active in this but it has been led by the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on the other side, on the customer side in the private sector, there has been little involvement. There is a reluctance on the part of customs brokers, freight forwarders, some of the larger customers, to move to electronic messaging. Some parties involved realise that, if they go to electronic messaging, the customer knows precisely where the cargo is. They blame the wharfie, saying, `We would have had your stuff here, it came in yesterday, we collected your money. But it is the wharfies again; we could not get it off the wharf.' A lot of that mythology would be exposed once we move to electronic data interchange, because the customer would just key in and find out immediately where the box is and what the delay is. It will speed the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be assistance provided in that area generally because it is the development of the software packages that is involved. The industry is saying that the market is too small. The users are saying, `Realistically, we cannot see the benefits so that we should go ahead and spend money and change our business.' That is because it is not just the introduction of electronic messaging&mdash;they have to rejig their business. They have to rejig their business and their whole operations to fit in with that electronic data interchange, better use of the waterfront generally and the transport chain to the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a recommendation that `The Commonwealth Government, through the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, fund a detailed assessment of the current environment for software development.' It should pick up not only transport, but also a range of the other industries, because it is a common problem. That is an area, we are convinced, where there will be considerable improvement once it is adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter I want to mention is this: I hope that there is going to be an end to this sloganeering, this rhetoric of `It's the wharfies, it's the wharfies, it's the wharfies.' That is why we said in the report that some of them have been convinced by their own mantra and that, if they chant `the wharfies, the wharfies, the waterfront' enough, somehow things will get better. It is in the hands of the users to get a greater improvement and efficiency and a greater financial return by looking at how the chain works and how they fit into it. By using their muscle&mdash;and they have got muscle&mdash;in their dealings with the transport providers with whom they do business, they will get a better rate and a better level of service than they are currently getting. I commend the report to the Committee and I thank my colleagues on the committee for their very valuable assistance, particularly the deputy chairman and the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to make some comments on the second report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oil spills: a response strategy</EMPHASIS>. The problem of oil pollution is one that excites the Australian public and one, when it happens near a built-up area, that the press and the media become very interested in. People become fairly excited and worried and there is a lot of misinformation about the problem, about the impact and about what we should do if an oil spill does take place. Australia has 37,000 kilometres of coastline and an oil spill could take place anywhere along that coastline, which means that a response by a national authority is somewhat difficult. It needs to be executed quickly. It needs to be done efficiently and, obviously, a fair amount of equipment is needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our inspection of the facilities at the Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre at Geelong really gave clear evidence of the ways in which you could handle this problem. The equipment and the response strategy that they demonstrated to us was first class. Given a set of circumstances that demanded a reaction from a national point of view, that equipment was available to be flown to any location around the Australian coastline. They had the whole matter in fairly good hands. Contributions for the running of that operation were from the government and from the oil industry. At the time we were inspecting the facility, training was taking place and it seemed to us that, given all the difficulties of mopping up oil after a spill, the equipment, training and methodology were fairly reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that the report identifies is the division of responsibilities and where these oil spills might take place, whether it be at the oil exploration areas&mdash;rigs, platforms and pipelines, which are obvious places where a major spill or conflagration might take place; at the oil terminals, where something might go wrong and the oil might spill in the port area; in ports other than the oil terminals; or beyond the three-mile coastal limit, where the jurisdiction by the Commonwealth is somewhat limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the committee's attitude towards the creation of the spill, we made the observation that crew competence in preventing the oil spills in the first instance is a key part of this whole argument. As we say on page 7 of our report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence shows that most marine accidents are due primarily to the negligence by a ship's crew (AMSA 1993:57). Accordingly, risk assessment plans are made more difficult due to the variables introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>We make the point that it is very important that, when we are shipping bulk quantities of oil, the crews handling these ships must be competent, well trained and aware of the consequences of any mishap that might take place when they are in control of that particular vessel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me that the oil spill argument has been dominated by the more extraordinary example of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> where 36,000 tonnes was spilt in Alaska, with the consequent loss of wildlife, pollution to the coastline, and an extraordinary amount of comment by international people. On that occasion, the competence of the crew and the captain were very much in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the breaking of the bow of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast brought home to most Australians the possibility of a major oil spill within the coastal belt. On that occasion, 17,000 tonnes of light crude oil were spilt from that vessel. The Western Australian coastline was saved by two natural factors&mdash;not by any man-made factors. These important points were that it was light crude and the weather conditions were such that the light crude moved out to sea rather than in towards the coastline. The important factor was not the activities of the Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre in conjunction with local people helping to disperse the oil, but the natural conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to the oil spills at a national level then moved onto the problem of whether the federal government or the state government has jurisdiction and responsibility for a particular area. In the report we identify statements by a state minister as to the responsibility of the Victorian government compared to the responsibility of the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> and the oil spillage into the Tamar River was again a focal point of the committee's deliberations. That identified a number of problems that we picked up during our discussions. Again, it was evident that the navigational problems at the entrance to the Tamar and the conditions at the time of the grounding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> were a problem in terms of that particular oil spill. Again, my observations of the maps that were tabled showed that the weather conditions made it difficult to mop up the spill. The weather conditions ensured that there was a wide spread of oil around the coastal area along the Tamar River and it was difficult for any authority or individual to clear that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> spill, the committee also looked at some of the other factors that could bring about an oil spill. They list them quite clearly in these terms: risk of collision; risk of grounding; hazards to navigation; seaworthiness of vessels; negligence of crews; size and type of vessel; type and amount of oil carried; traffic density; and environmental factors, including tidal flow and weather, et cetera. Whilst the public at large is concerned, all these factors are taken into account when considering where we might anticipate that there could be an oil spill or, more importantly, what we might do to prevent such an oil spill taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important feature that I would like to draw the parliament's attention to is the level of oil spills. I think there is some misinformation. I quote from page 29 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data showing the cumulative percentage of spills versus spill size shows that over 80 percent of recorded oil spills are less than 1 000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat: over 80 per cent are less than 1,000 tonnes. Whilst the Australian public is legitimately concerned about oil spills, let us remember that a vast majority of those are of a small nature and probably do not cause as much trouble as some people might believe. As the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only five percent of oil spills are greater than 10 000 tonnes . . . In Australia in the 10 year period to 1992, 98 percent of marine oil spills were less than 7 tonnes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think that gives a perspective on this argument compared to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> argument. In terms of recovery, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further fact is that international experts advise that it is rare to recover at sea more than 10 percent of the volume of oil spilt . . . In a similar vein, the review of the National Plan, under recommendation 3, sought to inform the community of the limitations in responding to a major oil spill. The review commented `that other than in favourite circumstances current technology does not exist to prevent weather driven oil coming ashore on a coastline or to guarantee prevention of environmental damage and economic loss' (AMSA 1993: 5).</PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that, whilst the committee and the audit review looked at the way in which Australia might respond to a major oil spill, from the evidence that we have heard, it will be difficult to handle a major oil spill. Environmental considerations and weather conditions will be important. The public should not be led to believe that, by spending large amounts of money and having the best technology available in the future, we will be able to contain any terrible catastrophe that might happen along the Barrier Reef or near some of our sensitive coastal areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) would agree, is to ensure that the crews are competent and that captains know exactly where they are along the coastal belt. More care has to be taken to ensure that large tankers do not run into hazards and more precaution has to be taken in some of the identified areas of risk. I note that five areas were identified in Australia&mdash;Cape York and Hervey Bay in Queensland, Port Stephens and Lake Illawarra in New South Wales, Cape Liptrap and Cape Otway in Victoria, the western Pilbara and southern ports in Western Australia. AMSA has identified the areas that ships' crews and captains should be wary of, and if they do have large amounts of oil they should be even more careful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with the observation, as I have heard the evidence, that the Australian public should not think that we have all the answers. This particular authority has the capacity to handle a large oil spill. There will be a natural attrition and breakdown of the oil in the sea over time. We have a good response mechanism, as technically efficient as we can get at this stage of the known technology. Every effort is being made by the authorities to do their best to address the problem and to be ready to respond to any such catastrophes that might occur. Given all these circumstances, I think it is fair to say that, if there was a major spill, the Australian public should be conditioned to some marine and environmental damage along the coastline if the weather conditions were a factor at the time of the catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us ensure that the skills of crews are improved, that the transport of oil is in modern ships and that navigational aids and the whole approach to the movement of oil and other chemicals, which we refer to in the report, is done in a safe and careful way so that the Australian public and the Australian coastline is not subjected to the catastrophe we saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps no country in the world is ready to respond to a major oil spill. Australia is no exception. But what the country should be doing is taking steps not only to respond to oil spills but to avert them. I think it is true to say that because of the rather freakish nature of all of them, they have not been responded to well. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) spoke about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS>. There was a very slow response there, for all sorts of reasons. Two or three years ago I went to the Shetland Islands to have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Braer</EMPHASIS> which went aground there and had the potential to cause disaster to the economy of that part of the world. Again, the response there was not good and they were very lucky because of all sorts of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is the freakish nature of the major oil spills that means that no-one is quite prepared to respond to them adequately. The committee was somewhat surprised that this report dealt just with the response, rather than with measures to avert oil spills. In this regard there are many issues that should be looked at, not least the question of crew competency, and much of my contribution to the debate today will be about crew competency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian seafarers are the best trained in the world, yet most of the seafarers who come to Australia are poorly trained&mdash;if trained at all. This is a matter of particular concern. There is often a language barrier between bridge and deck, and also amongst those in the deck crew. More and more charterers are going for the cheapest going rate, leading to the shameful situation where seafarers are often not paid, are abused and, if they complain, are placed on the blacklist held in the Philippines&mdash;if they have not ended up disappearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very much what we are talking about in this report&mdash;about crew competency to avert these things. Of interest in this regard is the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Star</EMPHASIS>, currently detained in Cairns. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Star</EMPHASIS> is a Panamanian registered sugar freighter which last week went through the compulsory pilotage area of the Great Barrier Reef without a pilot. This, incidentally, is a criminal offence and the master was before the courts in Cairns yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came to light only because there was a routine inspection by an AMSA inspector who noticed a lack of markings on the chart. This sorry saga is only one of a number of defects with regard to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Star</EMPHASIS>. The vessel's international oil pollution prevention certificate was out of survey; the main radio was not working properly; wastage of hatch coamings and bulwarks was found; and there was considerable doubt about the vessel's steering gear. </PARA>

It might be many other things, but it is not a competent crew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things coming out more and more&mdash;and I have had two cases put to me in the past week&mdash;are some of these vessels chartered to carry sugar around Australia.

Carl Scully, to initiate an immediate inquiry into the incident, the qualifications and skills of the crew, the condition of the vessel and whether all safety procedures had been adhered to. The call was echoed by the Maritime Union and, to the credit of the New South Wales Minister for Ports, he announced the establishment of such an inquiry into why and how the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> ran aground on 2 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and other many interested parties await the conclusions of this inquiry with a great deal of interest. Bass Point has a turbulent maritime history. It is a dangerous stretch of water, with rocks and reefs ready to inflict as much damage as possible on shipping vessels. The local paper ran quite an extensive coverage on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> incident under the headline `Bass Point notorious for undoing sailors of old'. It went into some detail about the ships that have gone aground there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some might say that discussing in such detail the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> incident is a storm in a teacup, but it is an issue of importance because it starkly demonstrates the need to establish, and strictly adhere to, the very best Australian and international seafaring standards of crew competence, safety procedure and vessel seaworthiness. The 60-miler trade has been serviced over the past 40 years by reputable shipowners who have incorporated the necessary level of safety and shipping technology and have ensured that suitably qualified crews on award conditions were engaged for this work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the present owner of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS>, Brett Devine, does not share the same interests in safety and the employment of satisfactorily qualified crews. Mr Devine seems intent on pursuing his simple, bloody-minded, anti-union agenda. Fifteen hours after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> hit the rocks and was stuck at Bass Point, Mr Devine came ashore and, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> described it, tucked a $100 bill into the grimy hand of a seafarer and told him to get three chickens, a couple of loaves of bread and some cigarettes. In the meantime, he publicly slammed the Maritime Union of Australia, its Port Kembla officials, the tugboat crews and, it seems, everyone in sight who did not agree with his view of shipping operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Devine has had a reluctance to negotiate an industrial agreement with the Maritime Union and is absolutely opposed to the incorporation into his employment practices of schedule 10, which specifies that seafarers should be engaged from the pick-up. In a letter dated 13 October 1995 to Mr John Garrett of the Maritime Union of Australia, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just to conclude, we are interested in concluding a fair and reasonable agreement with the MUA and other unions, if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Some remark&mdash;`if necessary'! Of course it is necessary. It is what the Maritime Union has been asking for and it is something that Mr Devine has tried to bluff and bluster his way out of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> is engaged in intrastate trade, Devine Shipping Pty Ltd does not have to meet the conditions and the provisions set out in the Navigation Act. Mr Devine is required only to meet provisions contained in the Commercial Vessels Act of New South Wales, which is something I have asked the New South Wales Minister for Ports to address. The Commercial Vessels Act does not provide for the employment of ABs or similar ratings. As far as the crew is concerned, the act provides for the employment of deckhands, and the minimum requirement for a ticket is a two-week sea and safety survival course at the local TAFE college. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> was still stuck on rocks at Bass Point I went out there to see for myself what was involved in the salvage operations and to see what the condition of the vessel was. Having seen quite a few vessels, and having been aboard quite a few also, the first thing that struck me was how old and antiquated this vessel was. I am advised that it has hatch boards and tarps in place. This is confirmed by Mr Devine in his letter to Mr John Garrett, to which I referred earlier. One would assume that a high degree of skill and competence was required in order to operate the vessel safely and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon investigation by the MUA it was discovered that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> crew did not have the minimum requirements to operate the vessel safely and efficiently. In fact, an application to the Waterways Authorities by Devine Shipping resulted in an exemption being granted to the crew to operate without the minimum formal qualifications. I ask: why was this exemption granted? Why was this crew granted an exemption to operate this vessel without the minimum formal qualifications?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> commenced to trade, the MUA quite properly slapped on a ban, which included the refusal to supply a pilot to the vessel. The dispute was referred to the New South Wales Industrial Commission for determination. The bans took immediate effect, but Mr Devine found it extremely difficult to defend his position before the commission. I understand that he became so frustrated with the proceedings that he sacked his legal representatives and continued proceedings himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various accusations have been made against tug crews in Port Kembla in the wake of the grounding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS>.

The fact is that the tug members in Port Kembla stood by with full crews in anticipation of being called upon to assist in refloating the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS>. A media release, issued by the general manager of Wallace Tugs Pty Ltd, Alan Roberts, puts the claims made by Mr Devine and Mr Seward in a more truthful perspective. It says:</PARA>

The spokesman claims that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Troy D</EMPHASIS> was denied the use of a tug from Wallace to help refloat the ship from rocks off Bass Point, and that somehow this was because of a union desire to classify the rescue operation as salvage.

Any damage to either of them obviously represents an economic threat to Far North Queensland. I think it is true to say that there is a general consensus in my electorate that that is the case.

On this occasion I said that, if there is any pollution which affects the marine life of the Torres Strait, the pollution will also affect the health of the people who live in the Torres Strait area. This situation would apply equally in relation to an oil spill, because the people of the Torres Strait depend largely on seafood for their basic diet. If there is an oil spill or any pollution from the Ok Tedi mine in the future, the health of the people who live in the Torres Strait area would be threatened. We all know about the health statistics for people in areas such as the Torres Strait; they are not good at all.

That is a great fear that I have and that is why it is very important that the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report and all the matters that are raised by the honourable members for Throsby and Shortland are attended to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought you were interposing something useful. I will move on. Pollution of the sea is from many sources and there is much lack of understanding of the forms of pollutants. If we look at the contribution that oil makes to polluting the sea, some 10 to 12 per cent of the oil that is spilled in the sea from tankers is recovered. It is very much a mirage or mirrors exercise. People see enormous efforts to recover oil from the sea but in the major oil spills only a very small amount of it is recovered. That is for a number of reasons: the difficulty of recovering the oil, the weather conditions at the time, and the evaporative quality of the oil&mdash;if it is a lighter oil, much of it evaporates. If the sea is rough, the oil is dispersed and broken up, depending on the currents and winds. It may be humanely impossible to recover the oil. That is just to describe the reality of situations that occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look to the nature of the spills, we find that 98 per cent of oil spills in Australia in the 10-year period to 1992 were less than seven tonnes, 1.75 per cent were between seven and 700 tonnes and the remaining 0.25 per cent were greater than 700 tonnes. That may put it into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at oil polluting of the sea, 12 per cent of all oil pollution is accounted for by tankers. It comes from tanker spillages. General vessel operations&mdash;the washing of tanks, the spillage over the side, the ordinary running operations of general vessels, not tankers&mdash;account for 33 per cent. A major and often overlooked source of oil pollution of the sea is from industrial discharge and urban run-off. That accounts for some 37 per cent. The largest single category is industrial discharge and urban run-offs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On afternoons when the rain starts to fall and oil glistens on the surface of the road, those of us who are in coastal environments know that, sooner or later, that oil will reach the sea. That problem can be readily addressed without any expensive oil recovery strategy, simply through better housekeeping. Certainly, there needs to be a much stronger effort in respect of industry operations to make sure that oil is not discharged into sewers and drains and everything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, the amount of oil that is legitimately disposed of is far less than the amount that is used. So there is a missing component. Whether it goes illicitly down a drain or into the sewer or into some land mass where eventually it finds its way into the aquifer or into the sea, it goes somewhere. It is a much bigger problem than just ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to ships, it is a major world problem. Australia is particularly vulnerable because of the length of our coastline and the sensitivity of our coastline. However, fundamental to the whole approach to containing oil spills and dealing with the problem is prevention. It is priority one. The main emphasis has to be upon making sure that ships are competently operated and that they know the areas that they are moving into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in the last few days we have seen the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Star</EMPHASIS> transiting the Great Barrier Reef without a pilot on board, and yet it is global knowledge and global practice through all forms of international shipping that piloting is compulsory in any movement through the Great Barrier Reef. It is the operation of ships and the competency of the crews that are the major contributors to collisions, groundings and sinkings of vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any sort of analysis of those causes shows that 80 per cent of ship groundings, collisions and sinkings result from human factors. By human factors, we mean the actions of human beings. Competency is the key part in that, along with ensuring that vessels are crewed by people who are competent to perform their tasks&mdash;people who can read charts, who can manage the wheel and who can ensure that it does not go over the side. It is amazing how many ships come into Australia with clean tanks and depart with dirty tanks, but when they reach the next port the tanks are clean. That is illegal under international maritime law, but it happens. Trying to detect it is much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is causing a great deal more worry&mdash;and we have covered it in our report, to an extent&mdash;is the greater use of single-voyage permit ships: foreign ships that are doing a voyage between two Australian ports. The use of single-voyage permits has virtually exploded in the last few years. In 1994-95, 434 foreign ships transited the Australian coast on single-voyage permits. In other words, they picked up cargo in one place in Australia and took it to another place in Australia. Of those 434 single-voyage permit foreign vessels, 70 were oil tankers&mdash;and that covers oil tankers of all types&mdash;63 were dry bulk carriers, and 301 were general cargo containers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People rhapsodise about oil and the spillage of oil from the grounding and rupturing of a tanker, but the offensive oil product is the bunker oil of the ship. That does not need to be from a tanker. With the recent grounding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> on Hebe Reef at the entrance to the River Tamar, the offensive element was the bunker oil of the ship. It is much more difficult to deal with: it is thicker; it is more offensive; it has a more detrimental effect on the marine environment; and it is very much affected by water temperature. In the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS>, where the water temperature was 11 degrees, the bunker oil very quickly formed itself into large lumps which made it all the more difficult to gather and to dispose of. Thus the care and supervision of single-voyage permit ships, in my view, must be greatly accelerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, if paperwork is presented showing that a vessel is competent to perform the task for which its use is sought, it is approved by the Department of Transport. That is not good enough. What we have learnt in this country&mdash;and what the rest of the world has learnt from us&mdash;is that competency is the prime factor in the operation of ships and the condition of the vessels themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the case, a couple of years ago, of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">APJ Anand</EMPHASIS>, on the west coast of Australia. She loaded wheat in Geraldton and came round to Mackay. That vessel should not have been at sea. It was in an absolutely disgraceful condition. But, because it was on a single-voyage permit, it had not been subject to compulsory inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very tough targeting system that applies to foreign ships&mdash;bulk carriers destined for overseas ports&mdash;loading in Australian ports. The same tough regime does not apply to foreign ships operating on single-voyage permits. It ought to. It is my belief that they are posing an increasing danger to our coastline, our fisheries and our sensitive and delicate marine environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move on from the nature of oil spills, how oil spills come about, and the emphasis having to be upon prevention. As I said earlier, when one says `shipwreck', people say `oil'. I put this to the Committee: the chemicals that are carried on board vessels can be much more damaging. Sulfuric acid is one. There are a whole range of oil products and a whole range of chemical products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the chemicals that were transported in Australian waters in 1992: sulfuric acid, sodium cyanide, ammonium nitrate, sulfur, propane, butane, caustic soda, soda ash, resin, fertiliser, and explosives. The focus is always on oil, but there are much more damaging ones. We had, back in September 1991, a Panamanian registered tanker loaded with tallow. Tallow can be extremely difficult to deal with. I say to the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) that if one drops 6,000 tonnes of tallow in the Great Barrier Reef one is going to have very difficult problems recovering that and preventing the damage it might cause. It is quite offensive. Even if it is in drums, it is a difficult cargo to handle if there is wreckage and spillage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jovian Loop</EMPHASIS> was a Panamanian registered tanker carrying just over 6,000 tonnes of tallow. It ran up on Unison Reef. The captain immediately sought to put the ship in reverse and pull it off the reef, which is absolutely taboo under international shipping practice. The first thing to do is assess damage, secure the ship and try to secure any punctures that may have been made in the hull. As good fortune had it, they ran up on the reef, the hull was not breached, no cargo was spilt, they got it into reverse and they eventually got off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that because I want Committee members to have a very deep think about the potential damage that would be involved if something like that happened with caustic soda, cyanide or sulfuric acid on board. It is not just oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back to oil. How does one attribute responsibility? There is oil discharged around the coastline, in the seaways, illegally. Tankers wash their tanks on the way to or the way from Australia, spilling oil overboard. That generally comes from poor practices, but there can be breakages or ruptures in shipboard gear. The difficulty, when one locates an actual oil spill, is in trying to track that back. After about 12 days, it is fairly difficult to try to identify the characteristics of the oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the Newcastle Port Corporation started a sampling procedure. All ships entering the port of Newcastle since l991 have had their bunker oil and bilge oil sampled. The Newcastle Port Corporation employees go on board in the normal course of their duties to connect phones and other services, so they are on the ship anyway. They take with them a plastic bottle which costs $1, and they take a sample of the bilge oil in the ship and a sample of the bunkers. If there is a spillage later on, they have samples there by which the spilt oil can be identified and used as evidence in the case of a prosecution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We recommended that that practice be adopted. It is very simple and it costs the port corporation about $7 per sample, because their officers are on board the vessel anyway. All it takes is a plastic bottle which they take back, label and put on the shelf. If nothing happens within a month, they dispose of the sample. The important thing is that it operates in two ways. Firstly, the sample is there as evidence, in case prosecution should be needed. Secondly, it has been one hell of a deterrent because there has not been an oil spill on the coast near Newcastle since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message goes direct to the captain of the vessel on board the ship that the port official has taken a sample not of all the oils but of the two key oils, the ones most likely to be emptied over the side or pumped out of the bilges. This creates an awareness in the minds of the crew of that vessel that we are watching it. Some people might ask how we would know there had been an oil spill. The resident population is absolutely vigilant on the coastline and, if anything looks like oil, telephone calls are immediately made to the port corporation and the matter is checked out. There has not been an oil spill since that date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Looking at the report on the provision of academic studies and professional military education to officer cadets and officers of the Australian Defence Force entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: The military after next</EMPHASIS> and looking at the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I think that this has been a very challenging exercise. When I look through the recommendations that we have achieved out of this report, I see it as being a very comprehensive and far-reaching report, one that looks at the problems that we are going to face in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no small part, we need to thank the original chairman of the committee, the member for Chifley (Mr Price) for the direction&mdash;if one likes to put it in those terms&mdash;and focus that he gave to the committee in the early stages to concentrate on what has actually come out as an excellent report. It is also important to recognise the contribution of the chairman, the member for Fowler (Mr Grace), and also the staff participants: Gillian Gould, who was secretary until July l995, followed by Matthew Mason-Cox; and the inquiry staff, Peter McLay and the committee adviser, Wing Commander Ken Given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one recognises that the whole process of change in the defence forces is a costly process, it is fairly clear that we need to look at specific areas, not the least of which is professional officer education&mdash;as opposed to officer training, and there are very clear and distinct differences between the two. I do not exclude training from the cost areas we need to look at, but it is a separate area and not part of this particular report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we have a look at what it is that we do in officer training at all levels and what the importance of those areas is, and try to come up with innovative ways in which we can improve this training process. It also has to be recognised, in view of the established process and the traditions that particularly apply in the military forces, that it is somewhat difficult to come up with ways and changes rapidly that will not have some implications for the traditions and the ways that things have been done in the past. In the services, of course, a great deal of emphasis is placed on tradition and the ways that things are done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a changing world and, as a result, we really do need to look at a number of these changes that are put into place. Having spent some time in the services and gone through one of the officer training establishments, I found it interesting to sit and look at the training processes and the resultant officers who came out of Skyville, Portsea and Duntroon&mdash;from an army perspective&mdash;and I really had to do some soul-searching and ask myself what the difference was in the result that we were producing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had to ask: is there a significant enough difference in result, based on the dollars that we put in, to justify maybe stopping and having a look at things being done in a different way? If one looks around at some of the senior officers that we have, a commander of the ADF was a Portsea graduate and, on the basis of that, he has obviously shown a lot of military skill in the process of getting to there. But, on that basis, the question I asked myself was whether, if Duntroon was set up as the key establishment&mdash;and we are now starting to see a lot of Portsea graduates flow into senior positions, simply because the process has required that period for some of these people to get through to those positions&mdash;there is any major difference in the process of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have come to the conclusion&mdash;and I think the committee has, too, when one looks at the recommendations that we have agreed on, even if for different reasons&mdash;that a series of education stages are needed, but that maybe what we need to do is refocus and look at it in a different way. The important part of that came out in recommendation 16 when we were looking at the undergraduate sponsorship and saying that we would like to see 1,000-odd places provided and the opportunity for people to go through the training systems to start with in order to enable them to be assessed for the military before the final commitments were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process is a bit of a two-way street. Firstly, it gives the potential officer training cadet the opportunity to have a look at the way the military system works, and secondly, it gives the ADF an opportunity to see whether that person is suitable. I think if that sponsorship system is implemented it will work quite well. I believe it is something that we should encourage because it is not just the academic requirements that we need of our senior military people; we also need a sense of being able to assess the situation and you cannot always pick that until you have put these people through the process. It seems a fairly cost-effective way of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important part of that is that we have seen many people talk to us about the value of the defence academy based on having the triservice involvement there and therefore having interaction between the three services. While I do not want to cut across what the recommendations say with respect to the academy, we have had that element built in. But I think the important part in all of that is that, in the future, there will need to be far more interaction with the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interaction of people going through the university streams out into other fields, and not just into other services, will be just as significant. In fact, it will probably be more significant because the interaction that will be able to be achieved will not be talking to somebody in another defence service who is having just as much difficulty getting the dollars together for what they need as you are in your service, but the opportunity to talk to somebody in a business outside who may be at the leading edge of a particular technology. That will provide an opportunity to interact and communicate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, that in itself will be significant in the future development and direction of our services. Realistically, at the rate technologies are moving, it is almost impossible to expect that our defence funding can keep up with the changes of these technologies. But it is important to know what technologies work, what technologies are usable. That aspect of it has been fairly important, certainly in the way that I have thought through the process of that sponsorship working. I think that will be significant if it is adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to recommendation 11, the request for ADF to do a feasibility study into establishing a triservice college with single service elements and replacing the single service precommissioning colleges. In effect, that also provides that interaction that the academy has had by bringing all of the people from the individual service colleges together to give them the experience of the interaction which will not only help them in their military careers but also, as they get further up the ranks, help them to understand and interact between the services. That will have considerable significance as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody could have done anything but look very closely at the costs of training a cadet at the academy. The recommendation that we have processed on this has been, in fact, a realistic one. I know that there will be some people on the committee who have concerns about that but I think that, when one looks at the costs of training cadets through the defence academy, as opposed to training them through the university system, it is very hard to justify the difference in costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that the interaction in the university will be significant. I suspect that my view on that comes in part from my having got out of the defence forces in my late twenties and found that the outside world was substantially different. I found that it took me probably six to 12 months to adjust and fit into the civilian way of doing things, having joined the services at a very young age. That, I suppose, has been part of the reasoning for my view that this relationship with the normal, everyday university student is important in the whole process of this education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was saying to me that a lot of people who go into the military systems at a very young age, work through the system, understand the military traditions and understand the military way of doing things have not got that experience of the outside world. When it comes to a time where that is needed&mdash;and the time they need that obviously is when they need to put their military skills to the test&mdash;those people need to understand the way that those around them in the community think. That part of it is significant. With respect to that, the recommendation that looked at particular parts relating to Australian citizenship and the whole role of Australian government and the way that it works is a significant addition to the training that is being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important also to look at the accreditation processes for officers. Many of the people who spend their life in the services find that the courses that they have done do not really help them in the outside world. A lot of these people, by virtue of their age, are required to go out and look for jobs. Sometimes, because they have spent years in the services, it is at an age where it is very difficult to get acceptance outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think the professional training&mdash;and it is good professional training that the military services provide for these people&mdash;gives people a leading edge in some areas, but the qualification interchange does not always work as well as it could. I think it is significant and important to get accreditation wherever possible. People should have the opportunity to gain diplomas and degrees for the training they undertake inside the military establishment. I think this is a significant and important aspect for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the processes that have been looked at by this report will, if adopted, provide substantially improved military officers with a far broader understanding of the community around them. It will also provide some cost savings and the opportunity for funds to go into other areas. Page 125 of the report looks at the commercial support program. Simply by sitting down and doing it better, a saving of $98 million has been achieved in that program. Better working arrangements between the 2,200 military people and the 980 civilians has meant that the money saved in this area has freed up people to go into the fighting elements of the services. We are grappling with these issues to ensure that we have sufficient levels in these areas. The achievement in that area shows that interaction in military officer training can also be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties involved here is that it really has to be looked in the long term. There are also some senior officer training elements in this program, and I have not specifically addressed those in my comments today, partly because other people will be addressing these elements. I have more input to the junior officer training level. We are really not going to know, for some 20 to 25 years down the track, how effective some of these changes are going to be in this area of junior officer training, simply because it will take that length of time to see whether some of these people make it to the very senior ranks of our forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I thank the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) for his thoughtful contribution to the debate this afternoon. His contribution exemplifies the background, the interest and the composition of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which was charged with the responsibility of following the reference from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to look at the whole issue of officer education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very generous and well deserved mention has been made of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who, as chairman of the committee, had a profound influence on the direction and the recommendations in this report. The Defence Subcommittee is very fortunate to have people such as the member for Chifley, who largely had responsibility for chairing the subcommittee. The new chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), has a large defence establishment within his electorate. The deputy chairman of the committee, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), served as Minister for Defence for a number of years. From 1989-90, I served as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other people, such as the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who had a distinguished period of service in the Royal Australian Navy. There are a number of other people with this sort of background, interest and experience, and these people have helped to make up an extraordinarily effective defence subcommittee. As I am prone to say to stress this point to the general public, parliamentary committees play an extraordinarily valuable role which is not often necessarily understood by the community at large. The committee system plays a valuable role, and it does so, in most cases, in a bipartisan way. The committee system results in reports like this report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which are very thought provoking and which will, hopefully, lead to major analysis and, therefore, change into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a landmark report which challenges some of the contemporary issues of officer education and training. It is important that we do challenge some of these views&mdash;not necessarily because we are critical of training and education per se, but because we are dealing with a unique profession. It is an honourable profession and it is an extraordinarily demanding profession. Major-General Gower, in evidence to the committee, made the point that the profession is unique because its members do not engage in their primary profession&mdash;war fighting&mdash;on an everyday basis. He said that, therefore, the problem facing the educators and trainers of military professionals is not only to prepare them for the eventuality of war fighting, in itself a difficult and demanding task, but also to fit them for the multitude of other tasks which military professionals will perform in peace time. This is the nub of the challenge in any issue associated with the education of military professionals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) picked up on a theme about which I intend to make some comments&mdash;the issue of the appropriateness of training in an institution which is primarily dedicated to officer education. I refer, of course, to the Australian Defence Force Academy, ADFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real dilemma for the people who are concerned with following through this report at governmental level and responding to some of the recommendations that we have made is essentially to make a judgment about the appropriateness of the training in this sort of institution: an organisation which was set up at a time when there was great hostility towards military education and the profession of arms. It was set up in the post-Vietnam period when, without going into the rights or wrongs of this particular period, there was a very negative view taken of people who served in the profession of arms. As a result of this situation, a separate institution was established. It is probably almost 20 years since the original timing of the decision to think about a separate institution, and it is, therefore, appropriate that we review the decision. The committee has provided a great deal of thought-provoking comment in its report and also some profound recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one issue. On the other hand, of course, if it is decided to follow the committee's recommendations and, therefore, to look at professional education in its broader sense through civilian universities, then the obvious comparisons and contrasts have to be made as to the appropriateness of this training for people who wish to serve in the Australian Defence Force past their secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the member for Isaacs spoke along these lines, I could not help but think that what he is really saying is that it is almost analogous to the situation when we ask, `Is it appropriate for someone to go straight from school into a seminary without any sort of worldly experience?' This is the only sort of analogy I can think of in terms of the current arrangements that we have for people who go, for example, into the Australian Defence Force Academy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an interesting philosophical issue. I am sure that defence planners and the chiefs of staff and their advisers, along with the Minister for Defence&mdash;who will, obviously, have to respond in time to this report&mdash;will have a great deal of thinking to do about some of these issues. On balance, they will probably be very grateful for the committee's work in challenging the contemporary situation as far as officer education and training is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the mere cover of the report is a challenging thing in itself. Three officers&mdash;two male and one female&mdash;are shown. Underneath that fairly straightforward picture, there is a blurred illustration of three people in the services which suggests&mdash;perhaps in a form of imagery, at least&mdash;a blurring of roles and responsibilities and, of course, a questioning of officer education in the military after next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the real challenge for the people who are our defence planners and who are preparing the military after the next: how do we actually train someone? How do we develop the skills, and how can we have the transfer of training required to be able to cope with a situation that is going to be radically different from a military engagement 20 years earlier?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost bizarre, sometimes, to see some of the movies that were made at the time just after World War II, and to see the machinery that was used in that war. Just a few years on, one could look at some coverage of the equipment that was used in the Vietnam War, which was the first war that was really televised into our living rooms. One could even make comparisons between that and the conflict in the Gulf, just a few short years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How different is it going to be in 20 years time? How does one develop the appropriate level of skill and training, and ensure that that training and skill level will transfer to 25 years down the track, when a young lieutenant will be approaching a rank of lieutenant colonel or higher?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a 1987 publication, Admiral Crowe, the former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a very interesting remark that is included in part 5 of the committee's report. I think it is appropriate. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our minds are like parachutes: they won't help much if they don't open when you need them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very true, of course, in respect of a whole range of endeavours, not the least of which is this particular report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very useful and timely report. I am not going to be around in the 38th Parliament to see the likely response of the government to this report. But I can assure you, as a person who has had a very significant interest in defence&mdash;at a ministerial level and, very proudly, as a member of this committee over almost three years&mdash;that I will watch with a great deal of interest the way in which the government responds to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that, when reports are tabled, it is an absolute miracle if every single recommendation is accepted, but I would be very surprised and disappointed if all of the recommendations were not treated seriously and thoroughly examined, because an important issue faces defence planners and governments in preparing the military after next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the work of this committee will at least ensure that, in the government response, we do get it right, and we continue the tradition of highly trained officers who are able to be diverse in transferring their training and skills to a whole range of wartime and civilian activities. I hope that great tradition continues in whatever form of officer education is accepted by the government in the years to come. </PARA>

I also pay tribute to Matthew Mason-Cox, who filled in at very short notice to complete the report for Gillian; to Wing Commander Ken Given, who has gone off to bigger and better things but whose assistance was valued by all members of the committee; and, finally, to Joanne Towner, the secretary of the present joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report would also not have been possible without the team effort by the Australian Defence Force. I think we had the full support of the Defence Force at all rank levels. There was a very `no warts' approach and people were very open about what we were doing. I pay tribute to General John Baker, and his officers and other ranks who were involved&mdash;and there were some other ranks involved in behind-the-scenes comments on this. When the honourable member for Chifley tabled this report, there were two points he made which I think we should record once again in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and with which I agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that the ADF merits commendation for its commitment to officer professional education and development, that it is second to none&mdash;and I would agree entirely with that&mdash;and that the high quality of the officer corps is a product of the individuals who are in it and the commitment to professional development, education and military training. He went on to say that the ADF is rightly proud of its traditions, but should not be frightened of creating new ones. I will come back to that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the report was a team effort involving a series of academics, who appeared before the committee in private and public hearings, and a number of retired people, such as Air Marshall Ray Funnell from the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies and others. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the significant contribution, albeit a relatively short one, of Dr Cathy Downes. I have to say that I think the title of this particular report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: The military after next</EMPHASIS>, was driven in very large part by the contribution by Dr Downes when she gave evidence to the committee&mdash;in private, I think&mdash;and made the point I would agree with entirely: that we need to take a quantum jump in a lot of these things and to be very open about a lot of the issues. Therefore, I think it was very appropriate that in this report we should address `the military after next' rather than just the next military. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Calare has indicated, I spent a lot of time in uniform before I came into this place&mdash;over three decades. Some might say that that has inhibited my ability to look at the sorts of issues that are raised in this report. I would like to think that that experience&mdash;supplemented by 7 1/2, going on eight years in this parliament&mdash;has provided me with another perspective to that experience. I would like to think that that has given me a more balanced view and an ability to look at some of these issues no longer as somebody wearing a uniform, but as somebody who is able&mdash;more objectively, perhaps&mdash;to look at some of the very important issues that were raised in the context of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with much of what is in the report. However, I have to say that I fundamentally disagree with some of it. That might sound a bit strange, because I put my signature to this report without a dissenting view. I should explain that the reason I did that was that I was given, as a result of some discussions with the honourable member for Chifley as chairman, the ability to publicly and privately disagree with some of these issues without going to the extreme measure&mdash;and I think it is an extreme measure&mdash;of including a dissenting view in a report of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that I am criticising Senator Margetts in terms of her dissenting report. I might disagree with her comments&mdash;and, indeed, I do disagree with some of what she has said, although I have to agree with her comments about more emphasis being needed in the human rights area. I do not agree with her comments that regional engagement, and regional engagement in terms of the training of officers from overseas, is counterproductive to our strategic effort. I think that is false, although I accept her right to make those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I think this is a very valuable report. It is a major report. It is a landmark report. It contains 23 recommendations, 13 of which I have very little difficulty with. With regard to the balance and, in particular, recommendation 14 on the Australian Defence Force Academy, I have already made it quite clear in the main chamber, and publicly when the report was tabled, that I cannot agree with that particular recommendation at this point in time. As a result, some of the other recommendations that flow from a recommendation that the Australian Defence Force Academy concept should be discontinued would not sit easily if recommendation 14 were not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the honourable member for Chifley is here in the Main Committee room because, as he knows, we have disagreed&mdash;and he and I will continue to disagree&mdash;on this. I think some of the remarks he made in the House and in tabling the report and, consequently, in public were counterproductive. In particular, I think his view that the ADFA concept is a stillborn concept is false. In hindsight, he might also regret the terminology that he used in terms of the nunnery. I know that the honourable member for Calare, in his contribution a moment ago, used a slight variation of that, referring to it as a seminary. I do not agree with either of those comments and I will refer to that in a little more detail in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also do not agree with the honourable member for Chifley that ADFA creates an elite. It creates a different grouping, but it does not necessarily create an elite. Finally, my disagreement with him in particular, and with the report in general, would be that budgetary implications seem to drive what is in the report. Indeed, I do not think that the budgetary figures add up to the actual recommendations that are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I agree with the honourable member for Chifley that the ADF must have, and continue to have, pride in its tradition. None of us, both inside and outside the ADF and in this parliament in particular, should in any way worry too much about new challenges. My personal view is that we should not have change for change's sake but if there is a demonstrable need then let us have it. In a large part of this report I agree with the need for those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the particular recommendation on the Defence Force Academy, I just have to point out to the honourable member for Chifley that the Defence Force Academy has not yet got a graduate who has reached the rank of major or equivalent. It only really started in l986 and, whilst perhaps I am rather conservative in some of my views, I would have to say, and I would hope that a lot of people would agree with me, that nine or 10 years is not really enough to prove or disprove the system that exists at the Defence Force Academy. As a result of that, I cannot agree to recommendation 14 and a number that flow from that&mdash;the centralisation of other colleges on the existing campus of the Defence Force Academy&mdash;at this point in time. That said, I think that everything in there needs to be studied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does worry me, however, is some sort of implication within the report that the whole issue is being driven ideologically. I say this with deep respect for the honourable member for Chifley, with whom I have a very good working relationship, but there seems to be running through this report a basic misunderstanding about the significance of rank. There seems to be some sort of ideological hang-up about a move towards a defence force which is a public service in uniform. I hope&mdash;it is not in this report but in another report, which is being taken at the moment within the Department of Defence, arising from what is termed the Glenn review&mdash;we will not see a situation where we will find the Defence Force really degenerating into a situation where it becomes a public service in uniform. Rank is not about elitism; rank is all about performance and experience. Within the defence force, rank goes hand in glove with experience, and you cannot replace experience overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just make one or two final comments. What is in this report and what has been said publicly about the Defence Force Academy concept has generated some concern amongst the existing students, the existing staff and, importantly, potential students. However, I think it is a very good report and it merits serious consideration at ministerial level. I think some of the recommendations can be implemented without partisan debate. Others will have to be looked at very carefully. I commend most heartily this report to the parliament. I hope that the ministers and the Department of Defence will review all aspects of the report very carefully and that a large number of the recommendations will be agreed to and implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, I want to pick up some of the themes that have already been raised. I would like to thank members for their kind remarks about my contribution but, as the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) points out, this report does reflect teamwork and there have been improvements to the report that the committee as a whole and individuals can take a great deal of credit for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the pleasure of working with the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) on employment, education and training and now on defence. He is the sort of bloke who does not say a lot, but when he does people listen. He has been a bit of a bell wether for me because, when the honourable member for Isaacs says he is worried about something, I know that I have got a serious problem. He is someone whom I hold in high esteem. As the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) pointed out, all members of the committee take a great deal of pride in the committee and in the way it operates. We take pride in the fact that some committee members have been former portfolio ministers, and that we have people like the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who has a proud record of having served in uniform in the navy, and others who have performed under national service&mdash;for instance, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson). The current chairman of the subcommittee has served in wartime&mdash;in the merchant navy, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people bring strong and bipartisan views, and a concern for the ADF. In some ways, one of the problems of the subcommittees is that we are not critical enough: we are very strongly supporting. To reiterate, this is a good report. It reflects the best traditions of parliamentary committees; it reflects the good work performed by the defence subcommittee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to clear up a couple of things. Firstly, I mention the idea that the report is ideologically driven and that the committee wants a public service in uniform. I do not think that is my position at all. We need to look at some very important reports. The Glenn review has been mentioned and the government is currently considering this. Army 21 is another report and also the Noble manpower study. These reports are very significant and really point out that the ADF cannot ignore what is happening out there in civilian employment. Whilst the ADF will always lag, and properly so, it cannot lag too far behind. Therefore, we have got to be much more flexible about part-time employment in the ADF; we must not penalise people who move from full-time to part-time, or vice versa, which we currently do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, the ADF is to be congratulated for having female officers coming through&mdash;probably more than most. If we are to recoup some of that investment, not only do we have to allow them to fluctuate between full-time and part-time employment but also we have to allow them to opt out for periods without suffering gross penalties. In that sense, we need to move with the times. This is the theme of the honourable member for Groom and I have no difficulty about pleading guilty to that. Over the next five years, I think we will see some rather dramatic changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Groom also said that this report was being driven by budgetary considerations. I am on the public record in a number of places as saying that the cost of ADFA is a third order priority as far as I am concerned. It is also a baseball bat because ordinary people outside will not understand that over $400,000 has to be spent before the army produces an officer to go to his first unit, and the ADFA component of that is $308,000&mdash;a huge amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall stating the very same analogy to a very senior officer, and he said, `Do not be too proud. Make sure when you are in the dugout that you have the baseball bat close by.' Even if we can afford to sustain this cost over the next couple of years, I just do not believe this cost is sustainable into the next century. The pressure on the defence dollar is going to be great even if, under the five-year budget, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) sees a slight increase coming in years 3, 4 and 5. The pressures are going to be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us in the defence subcommittee want to ensure that the ADF preserves its capability no matter who is in government. We want to ensure that there are no cuts or changes to the ADF that interfere with its capability. It is for that reason that you have to apply what are the standard defence concepts, value for money and acceptable premiums. If you are looking into the future, if you are looking into the military after next, you cannot sustain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of the report provides a good opportunity to clear up some confusion. One of the themes in this report is jointery. I am surprised at the diffident definitions and concepts around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For what it is worth, I want to put down what I thought jointery was all about. Basically it is about three things. Firstly, it provides informal networks. In other words, as a class or a cohort go through there are inevitable informal links that people make across the three services that stand them in good stead in their future careers. The second thing is that jointery is not just an aspect of sitting down together and forming a class; it is ensuring that people understand, appreciate and are knowledgeable about the different functions and roles that the different services perform. This is important for the officers in their careers. Last, but not least, a jointery ought to facilitate joint operations&mdash;in other words, with the contacts and with the knowledge to make it far smoother and more effective when they are in a joint operation. That is what I think jointery is all about. This report is stating that it is really good, that ADFA pioneered this at the earliest stages of an officer's career and we want to continue on with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the scholarship side, one of the things that has not been understood is that people awarded a scholarship would still be eligible to collect Austudy if they met all the other conditions. They would have their scholarship money plus Austudy, which is doing very nicely, if I might say so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that has been put to me that really drives me nuts is the idea that, because we have mentioned that the labour market for graduates has changed dramatically since the 1970s and the 1980s and mentioned that there is an oversupply of graduates, somehow the committee is proposing that we troll through unemployed graduates asking them if they would like a military career. Nothing could be further from the truth. What we are doing with the scholarship scheme is identifying people who are starting their undergraduate course, offering them a scholarship, making sure that they progress, and at the end of the day making a final selection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is that the scholarship scheme is a sort of free ride. I must say that one of the important contributions of the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was to come up with the suggestion that is adopted in the report that there needs to be a period of basic training&mdash;not great but basic training&mdash;before people start the scholarship. In that way there is a loose connection throughout the scholarship of military training so that it is not just a free ride: there is some quid pro quo in it. I believe the scholarship scheme will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to me that maybe we need to start by having a trial scheme on the scholarship. That is fair enough, and I have no difficulty with that. I think it will work in spades whilst ADFA continues; but, at the end of the day, my position fundamentally is that ADFA must go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Groom was picking me up on some of the language I have used, and that is fair enough. I want to make the point that, in keeping with the way the committee operates, I avoided the temptation to be partisan about ADFA and to concentrate on the controversy that surrounded its establishment. I failed to pick up on all the juicy bits about ADFA&mdash;for example, the history of bastardisation and the issue of sexual harassment. I have put that to one side, as the committee has done, and have concentrated on all the positives, and there are plenty of positives about ADFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By adopting such an approach in debate, you make it more difficult to give force to your arguments. If you are presenting a simple and clear message that ADFA is all bad, that is much more easily understood out there in voter land; but that is not something that I would do. That approach is dishonest and it is not even consistent with my own views. ADFA has been good. It was a bold step to set it up; it guaranteed a supply of university undergraduates and it introduced jointery. Today, I am still very proud of what ADFA is turning out. I am looking forward very much to going to my first passing out parade next month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have been hurt by what has been said about ADFA ought to understand that the committee is saying that, in the context of the military after next, looking to the year 2000, it feels that these changes are absolutely necessary. After all, about $100 million out of a $200 million budget is spent on ADFA. For 1,000 undergraduates, we spend $100 million, and for the other 11,000 officers in professional development we are spending $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that other important changes recommended in the report have, in a sense, slipped by almost without comment in the public arena, yet I believe they are fundamental and very important. For my own part, I believe the recommendations in this report facilitate the notion that regular officers, full-time officers and reserve officers should be undertaking the same courses together in the same institutions. This is a very big step for our part-time army reserve. There are difficulties with it, as we were told last night; but, again, these are very solvable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To wind up, I would like to again acknowledge that the production of this report was a team effort. I see that the right honourable member for New England is about to speak, and I must say that it was a privilege to work with him as deputy chairman of the subcommittee. I also acknowledge the generosity of the incoming chairman, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), in allowing me to take this report through to the chairman's draft stage, although at that point I was no longer chairman of the subcommittee. I believe that this report will stand the test of time. I really hope not only that it provokes the ADF but also that it is implemented by them. I sincerely hope that they look at the military skills side, which was not part of our terms of reference but which they are most suitably placed to review, and that they make sure that the two things are in sync. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the recommendations, those interested in officer education and in the basis of the development of the structure of the Australian Defence Force will find that there is a lot of information in this report which is of great value. A report of this sort provides a factual groundwork on which people looking at aspects of officer education can make conclusions and form their own views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the product of the officer training establishments now operating for the Australian Defence Force is quite outstanding. One only needs to look at the incredible record of young graduates, for example, taking their part professionally in various peacekeeping forces in each of the three services. That is a role which is not specifically within the designated task of the Australian Defence Force and yet they have performed it with exceptional ability. Australia is very fortunate indeed in the quality of the young men and women who today hold commissioned rank in the services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that all of them are of equal calibre, nor does it necessarily mean that those who are promoted to senior officer rank were necessarily the cream of the crop at graduation. Part of the problem that we have as parliamentarians in assessing officer education is looking at why some people leave the services after having had a great deal of time and effort spent on their training and development&mdash;some in formal courses, some in the field&mdash;and in professional skills and disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One suspects that many of those who leave could very easily and very capably have filled high office in the services, yet they leave and contribute to the wider community instead. The problem of retention and the reasons why some leave and some stay is at least as important an issue as the training. We should not lose the enormous amount of experience that is inevitably acquired through the functions that they fill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the development of the professional corps is that more and more service personnel are becoming specialised. In days gone by it was true that you could be a generalist and perhaps at the end of the run be seen as being able to perform any role with as much ability as somebody who had been trained in the task, with odd exceptions in particular fields like engineering, science and some other disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, people are becoming specialists more and more. For pilots and those with particular skills there has always been a requirement to be trained, but I remember in the air force that we were all general duties pilots. When you are one of those you really are considered to be able to do anything. I must admit that I do not know that that necessarily followed, but it is the way the disciplines of the past were applied. It concerns me that we look at the requirement in terms of officer training. I want to talk in this general way before I look at the report because I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that aspects of the report are unanimously presented does not mean that we all had the same view. It means that we felt that it was better to try and ensure that before the officer training program is accepted we come to some general consensus as to where it should go. I must admit that I have views on each of the levels of officer education, some of which are not necessarily in accord with this report. I want to speak briefly about each of them because I think they are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall begin with the initial entry. There are a range of ways by which young men and women at this stage receive their training as officers. A remark has stuck in my mind that was made during our public hearings by the then commandant of Duntroon. I am sure it applied not only to the army but equally to all the services. He said that after six months those who were ADFA and those who were direct entry cadets really could not be distinguished one from the other. It interested me that, among the cadets at Duntroon, some had come from the ranks&mdash;in other words, were experienced as ordinary soldiers before they came in as cadets, some in peacekeeping commitments&mdash;while others had served at ADFA and had the benefits of a university type of education. They had come from considerably diverse backgrounds and yet the commandant said that after six months he could not distinguish between them. It concerns me therefore to look at recommendation 11, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the ADF conduct a feasibility study into the establishment of a tri-Service pre-commissioning college with appropriate single Service elements to replace the existing single-Service pre-commissioning colleges.</PARA>
<PARA>Because the service is becoming more specialised, as I suggested a few minutes ago, I have little doubt that in each of the services an opportunity must be provided to learn the trade, if you like, of that particular service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some doubts about the capacity to have a triservice pre-commissioning college, other than to the degree to which we look at where we go with ADFA. In our recommendations regarding ADFA, I will pick up&mdash;and I am not going to have time to do it&mdash;the fact that I think there is a reason to have triservice training in lieu of ADFA. The training that is provided separately now in each of the single service colleges is outstanding, and I do not believe that that can easily be replaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADFA has always worried me because I grew up in a generation immediately after World War II when so many from the services were at the university and when some who had been very senior officers in the Australian Defence Force were doing their university education. I have felt that there is a real advantage in opportunities being given for people who are going into the Defence Force to mingle in the wider community, within the various disciplines that are available at universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several reasons for that. One is that the initial education can be done in their own state. In other words, people who come from Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland or wherever are able to do part of their tertiary education in a university in their own state and then come together to get their professional education. While ADFA has produced some outstanding young men and women graduates, given the cost of ADFA and the fact that those young men and women are growing up in an atmosphere removed from other undergraduates and that the commandant of Duntroon has said that, after six months, he cannot distinguish between them, I do not believe that the maintenance of ADFA in its present form is justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason I am one of those who believe quite strongly that it would be far better to adopt a scholarship scheme, and recommendations have been provided in the report. Whether that is the right way to go, I believe, is more a matter for the professionals. We have suggested in recommendation 16 that if there is a sponsorship scheme the students should go through a pre-entry introduction to the services to learn how to be service personnel before they go to university. Throughout their university education they would remain attached to a training establishment, both triservice and single service, so that by the time they have finished their university education they have achieved approximately 12 months of military training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After they have graduated they would need to go back for triservice and single service training. Time for that has been recommended to be set aside but the length of that training needs to be assessed, and that is, as I say, a matter for the professionals. By being educated in the wider world they are going to gain access to those who will become graduates in all sorts of careers and their access as senior service personnel will be much wider than it would be by being graduates of ADFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it means they are going to be any better officers at the end of the run is a matter of judgment. I was minister at the time that ADFA was established. I had a great deal of input in the cabinet discussions when John Gorton first raised the question. It was a matter that John Gorton as minister for defence, Malcolm Fraser as minister for defence and Jim Killen as minister for defence raised; it was not just Lance Barnard and the Labor Party who thought about where we should go in officer education. This concept has had a long evolution, and I am one of those who feels that the ADFA concept is not worth the high expense that it needs in its present form, and therefore it is worth looking at this alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have made recommendations, I would hope that they are not dismissed and are looked at very carefully. I think that it is essential that we do not wait, although I know my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) would like us to wait a little longer before we make a judgment on ADFA. In my view, there really has to be an assessment made of this alternative. I think that there are ways by which you could train officers to the same degree as you are training them through ADFA by sending them out to the wider university. I think you would actually produce better officers as a result of it, and I believe that recommendation needs to be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made some recommendations about setting up a single staff college. I think that is the way to go. Our recommendation 13 would fix that up and should allow at the same time the individual requirements of each of the services. They do vary in the duration of their courses, but with each of those senior colleges&mdash;the senior staff colleges of each service, the Joint Services Staff College and the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies&mdash;I have real worries. I do not believe the people who are going are necessarily the people who should go; often they are the people who are available to go. The more that funds are restricted to the services, the more likely that is to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me that the time taken out of a senior officer's career is such that it would be very difficult indeed for all those who should go to be given vacancies. I believe, for example, that it is quite impossible for a senior officer who is in a highly responsible job to take the 12 months that the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies presently requires. I think it would be far better to have many short courses, to allow more personnel to go, and to make sure that everybody goes to them. Although we have made recommendations with the Joint Services Staff College, we have made none about the ACDSS. I feel quite strongly that the time for both is in fact too long for people who need to go, and therefore you are not getting some of the people who should go to those courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to look at ways by which people can take those courses externally on the theoretical side so that they can spend perhaps less time together in a physical sense. I think that we do need to look at how management in the commercial world and in the professional world operates. Every profession has courses that are available to senior practitioners, and not every one of them takes 12 months, because most people cannot afford it. I worry that, because of the way these courses are structured, we are precluding people who should go to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I go along with the recommendation of this report, and endorse much of what has been said by my colleagues, each one of us has a different emphasis and a different background, which means we perhaps come to different conclusions. There are a number of these recommendations where I think some of us have doubts. At the same time, I do not believe that the Defence Force should just cast aside the recommendation on ADFA, and I think they need to look very carefully at the comments we have made at each of the levels of officer training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential requirement for the future is that the quality of today's officers is at least maintained in any change, and that we try to ensure that every officer of the Australian Defence Force is given an opportunity to enter those senior colleges. If they do not, and people are promoted although they have not been to them, that rather suggests that the courses themselves have a deficiency. I think, therefore, at each level, officer training needs to be reviewed not only as we have done as politicians but also within the Defence Force, and I would hope it is something that each of us can look at again in the new parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">military after next</EMPHASIS>. I preface my remarks with some general comments about defence and the way we should be looking forward when we talk about the military after next, and, more importantly, what that means in terms of where the nation is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to start from a fundamental point with an observation that, until we have a government that runs the economy and reforms the economy so that it can start to go forward, we will always have a problem in providing the necessary resources to provide effective security for Australians. That is a fairly fundamental point which should preface remarks on this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I make in prefacing my remarks is that we need to improve our approach to defence issues and, in particular, we need to bring more debate before the Australian people. We need to bring it to the attention of the general public so that they become more involved and take a greater interest, and then, we hope, demand greater accountability and performance in the maintenance of the proper defence of this nation. Thus I make the point about the importance of a reformed economy, one that actually moves forward, which will place us in a position to be able to afford the sort of defence capability necessary to ensure the future of Australia as a free nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes right back to the question of political leadership. At times, the current government has been lacking in giving defence the sort of priority it should have. Clearly, in some ways, the defence forces themselves have something to answer for in the whole question of public relations. Too often, I believe, the public relations of the defence forces have tended to cover up some of the deficiencies of the government, keeping the Minister for Defence himself out of the firing line rather than highlighting what the wider public ought to be fully informed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that, in informing the Australian public, we also ensure that Australian industry is fully aware of the importance of defence. I know that some sections are very good when it comes to supporting our reservists, but I think that many are not fully aware of the importance of an adequate defence force. They ought to be made aware of that, not only in terms of the national interest but in terms of what it could mean for their own particular industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, some of our tertiary institutions have not improved the education and understanding of the general public and, in particular, they have not analysed why some of our neighbours seem to spend a lot more time emphasising national self-reliance&mdash;not only our neighbours but many other countries in the world&mdash;and why they put such an importance on these issues when in Australia we seem to be a little complacent and believe that we can put it off and not worry about it today because it will not be a problem in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of issues that should have a higher profile in the national debate. An awareness of their importance would then back up some of the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, when they do their grand tours of the world deluding themselves that Australia is more influential than it really is. One of the reasons that we do not carry the sort of influence that we should is, as I have mentioned, because we need to improve our economic performance. By doing that we can demonstrate that we have a real defence capability that matches the rhetoric that too often both the Leader of the Government (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, seem to indulge in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really the starting point. It is backed up by the very real concerns that I think many Australians would have had on reading the comments earlier this week of the recently retired Chief of the General Staff, General Grey, when he made the point that he did not believe Australia could sustain a prolonged defence of the nation. That was a very disturbing comment from an eminent person who is highly regarded and is certainly someone who would not make those comments lightly. I would have thought that they should have been given far greater prominence and had far more response from the government than appears to have occurred so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to the report itself and one of the central issues&mdash;the closure of undergraduate training of officers at ADFA&mdash;it is very important that we ensure that, if the government chooses to go down this path, it is extremely well managed. This is going to be one of the critical issues. If it is not well managed, there could be some serious long-term ramifications of making what would be a fairly major change in the approach to officer training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that change, we obviously have to look very closely at the whole question of scholarships. I think that should be trialled as a way of ensuring that we do not run into the problem that was raised by one of the very senior staff at ADFA, Dr Hugh Smith, when he pointed out that his main concern&mdash;if we go down this path&mdash;was that the ADF would not be able to attract numbers of suitable graduates to fill its officer ranks. That is a serious comment and something that we should be very mindful of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other comments that might back up the move down this line. Interestingly, I found in talking to a friend of mine who is an officer in the reserve that he felt very concerned about some of the attitudes of ADFA graduates. Probably one of the more telling comments he made to me was that it seemed that in the army there was a feeling that they have difficulty thinking laterally. That is just one piece of anecdotal evidence, but I have a high regard for this person and therefore would listen to his comments quite seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to emphasise that is running through some of the recommendations and that I think shows there is still need for improvement in the whole question of officer training was highlighted with the experience of the Kangaroo 95 exercise this year. Despite the significant commonality of the staff colleges, there is still the opportunity for separate training. But the K95 experience showed that there is a weakness of command and control. If Australia is going to be put in a position where our defence forces are going to have to take the leading role, this weakness is going to have to be addressed. Considering that this is not something that is particularly new&mdash;it has been recognised for some years now&mdash;there is growing concern that it still does not seem to have been resolved. Therefore, I think this point has to be put on the priority list and, in training our officers, we have to make sure that we can get past that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that could be made about the current officer training is that it is a very structured system. In relation to the training through their careers, there is a feeling that, if officers miss the opportunity as they move up the ranks to get additional training, they will miss out because there is a fairly narrow opportunity as they go through their careers of getting that additional training and getting the opportunity to get promotions as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly this is an issue which defence forces are still going to have to look at. As I say, because training can be very structured, there is a feeling amongst some that there is not enough encouragement of officers to take their own initiative, and there are times when those who are natural self-starters will feel that their ability to take that initiative is being inhibited. There is a strong feeling that the current system is working very much against those people. Even given the importance of the way defence has to operate, nonetheless we should be giving more encouragement to those future leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that must be emphasised in the whole question of training in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The military after next</EMPHASIS> is the importance of developing links within the civilian community and, importantly, within industry. Given that one of the areas that we are going to have to look at in defending the nation is what might be called New-Age threats&mdash;I am talking about things such as information warfare&mdash;it is terribly important that the leaders of the military do have that capability through the fact that they have a wide range of contacts in industries that either could be threatened or could assist in the defence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also must be emphasised that in looking forward we must not overlook some of the present demands that are being made on the military, in particular the very important and significant role that members of the Australian Defence Force are playing in peacekeeping around the world. They are acquitting themselves in such a way that all Australians could be very proud. It is important that we do not overlook that role because, unfortunately, it looks like being a demand that is going to be made on nations such as Australia for the foreseeable future. I would just highlight again that it is going to be a major challenge to make the transition towards some of these recommendations if they are followed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like now just to comment on two other aspects. Firstly, I think that it was disappointing to see the dissenting report of Senator Margetts. I think that it shows that particular senator is losing her credibility by continuing to write these dissenting reports which really are pushing another barrow which is not directly related to the main thrust of this report. Secondly, I would also like to put on record my thanks to the staff. I mention particularly Gillian Gould, who put tireless effort into working for the committee, and Matthew Mason-Cox, who then took over from Gillian in July; and I thank Peter McLay and Wing Commander Ken Given for their support. The committee greatly appreciated the work that was done which helped to bring this report up to the sort of standard that is expected from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with those remarks and say that I too support the thrust of this report. I think that it offers some very challenging recommendations for the next government and I believe it will be one of the major issues that will have to be considered in the future of our defence forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of us have been conscious of the very dramatic changes that have occurred in our region and have been generally impressed by them. It does not mean that we have necessarily seen each country as falling into the one mould, nor does it mean that we have endorsed all&mdash;or, for that matter, any&mdash;particular policy of any of the countries in our region. ASEAN has grown and become a very significant regional organisation and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has just returned now from a meeting of APEC, another association which is bringing, in trade terms, a group of countries in this region together, with perhaps a more commercial bent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each one of these forums is really intent on trying to open up the opportunities for dialogue and for individual progress; as a result, living standards generally have risen. We in Australia are conscious that comparatively our standards seem to be falling, particularly when one measures them by economic criteria, against the standards in countries such as Singapore, or even Malaysia or Hong Kong, and the new tigers, Japan and Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, within our region, a number of countries are still quite properly concerned about what we see as human rights. I met a parliamentary delegation from Thailand last week and they said that, as Australians, we have to accept that they do not see everything as we do. They are different ethnically and religiously and they have different attitudes from us. As a result, we need to be very careful about what issues we lecture them on because they are going through a different stage of evolution and their standards and attitudes are different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While that might well be so, this report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma</EMPHASIS>, is not intended in any way to be prejudicial against the individual judgments that the government might make. For the purpose of this report, we have used the name Burma, or Myanmar, as some might call it. We have attempted to identify the areas where we see Burma falling behind other countries in this region. These are areas where we believe the State Law and Order Council, or SLORC, is prejudicing reasonable development. It is not for us to determine the form of government or the leaders who will set the policies of the country. The policies of SLORC seem to deny significantly the rights of individuals in that country. The report itself follows a reference from the Senate. In that reference, we were requested to inquire into and report on the human rights situation and the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma (Myanmar). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the product of that inquiry and, in opening, I would like to pay particular credit to the former chairman of the committee, Mr Stephen Loosley. At that time he was a senator and he led the early part of the inquiry. More recently, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) assumed that role after Mr Loosley retired from the Senate. The real praise and thanks must go to Margaret Swieringa, who, within the subcommittee secretariat, has put an inordinate amount of time and effort into the preparation of this paper, which is a very good analysis of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I open by saying that I would hope that those in Burma, and particularly the members of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, do not dismiss the report because it comes from Australia. The concerns that we have here are very genuine; they are very valid; and they are totally bipartisan. While we all feel very strongly about these issues&mdash;and we do not necessarily have the same view&mdash;when it comes to human rights and the development of democracy in Myanmar, there is no doubt that we are all concerned that progress seems to have stalled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I want to pick up some of the issues surrounding our recommendations and some of the conclusions we reached. Firstly, it is worth noting that we have defined human rights in chapter 2 of the report. We have done that because human rights is something that is seen differently in different countries&mdash;and I have mentioned my friends from the parliamentary delegation from Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might well be that in the interpretation of human rights there is some room for variation, but our reason for putting in this definition is to make it clear that we are not talking about matters that pertain to government, or forms of election or even the processes of administration. We say that human rights are the rights we have&mdash;that is, each of us as humans&mdash;because we are human beings; they do not belong to us because we are of any particular ethnic origin, be it Australian, Burmese, Chinese or American. As they belong to us as human beings, they cannot be modified or coloured by nationality, historical experience or culture. It is very important that we understand that. The record of evidence that led to this report produced some absolutely horrific stories of the way in which individuals were treated within Burma (Myanmar). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was appalling to hear of conscripted labour, of the fate of some of those who are minority peoples in Burma, of the extent to which there was trade in women and children across the borders, and of the extent to which they were exploited with no opportunity of any individual resistance. It is appalling to think of the physical punishment, the torture, the deprivation that was applied to individuals. While we have not catalogued it, there is reference to some individual instances. Some of the evidence we have received is absolutely horrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drug trade is very much part of it. It has flourished in northern Burma for many years. Unfortunately in the Shan state major Chinese narcotics traffickers have become involved. There is traffic across the border into Thailand, and there has been not only a trade in humans but a trade in drugs. The price paid for drugs means that it has become by far the most profitable form of commerce. War lords develop their own individual empires around the drug trade. It is a situation which leads us, as members of the Australian parliament, to have great concerns as to where Burma is heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has decided that he is now not going to visit Burma, although it had been announced that he intended to do so. There is always a difficulty in knowing how far you can, by not maintaining or having a dialogue, persuade others to your point of view. I have always been of the view that we need to maintain to the maximum, dialogue with countries which have different attitudes from ours. For that reason I am very strongly in favour of our maintaining senior diplomatic representation in Rangoon. It is essential that we have dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also essential that the government of Burma, the SLORC regime, ensures that visitors are allowed free movement within that country. It is important that people are allowed to go up country, to go to the Thai border, to see the refugees, or to talk to those who have been returned from neighbouring countries, so that there can be assistance given. At the moment the assistance given on the Thai side of the border largely stops at the border. The non-government organisations are inhibited in the work that they can do within Burma. There is a problem in trying to ensure that there is free access for those who would help the underprivileged and the persecuted within Burma. It is absolutely essential that they be given access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those of us in Australia, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has symbolised our concern. I know of her through the award of the Nobel prize, and I have heard her broadcasts. From the little I have heard of her, I have been incredibly impressed. Anyone who has heard her cool, rational argument, registering the fact that having been elected as Prime Minister she was held under house arrest, and was not permitted to engage in normal political activity, has to be impressed by the way in which this woman has been able to hold her head high and still muster forces&mdash;not in the military sense, but in the democratic sense&mdash;against a regime which engages in abuses which we condemn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hear that only this day there seems to be a new wave of persecution against her concerns me greatly. I do not believe it is going to help Burma. It is not going to help the government, or the people of Burma, if the SLORC insist on preventing Daw Aung San Suu Kyi participating in political processes, nor is it going to assist in the transfer to democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that the SLORC regime registers the fact that nations like Australia believe that assistance from the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank and international aid should not be permitted if the regime prevents normal democratic processes. For my money, it is a great pity because, when this happens, it is not the members of the regime who suffer; it is the ordinary men, women and children. In Burma, the ordinary men, women and children badly need help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burma is, of course, a large, strategically placed country which borders India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It is a country which is close to much of the cauldron of development in this region: India and China, the two largest countries in the world. There is no doubt that numerically, in population terms, Burma is a country with enormous natural resources, both human and physical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of interest that the former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, visited the country, but it concerns me greatly that he did not see Daw Aung San Suu Kyi when he was there. It concerns me that he came back and reported&mdash;in a way that most of us think is very sad&mdash;that he thinks much progress has been made by SLORC and that he is very impressed with individual members of SLORC. I trust that the ordinary people of Burma understand that the views that former Prime Minister Hawke expressed are not necessarily those of the Australian parliament. Indeed, many of us feel that there has been too little progress. It is on this very score that the recommendations in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&mdash;which are largely directed towards bringing Burma back into the international community&mdash;are directed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the government of Burma will not just dismiss the recommendations, but will read the recommendations and understand that they are intended to help Burma, not to hinder Burma. The recommendations are designed to help progress the people of Burma and to give to the people of Burma the same individual rights which the members of the SLORC regime seek for themselves. This is what this report is about. The report is trying to bring Burma (Myanmar) back into the international community. If, in a small way, the report can help to this end, the report will be worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the parliament and, above all, I commend it to the members of the SLORC regime. I trust that the process of democracy and the evolution of attitudes towards individuals will progress as a result of the report for, sadly, these matters seem very backward at this time. </PARA>

When we talk about the opposition in Burma, what one should always be aware of is that, in the elections of 1990, the opposition had a considerable win. The party, lead by Aung San Suu Kyi, actually won 392 of the 486 contested seats, but the SLORC blocked the party from taking power and, as we know, put the leader of the party under house arrest, where she remained until recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we find coming out in reports in all the leading newspapers is that the SLORC is continuing its very hardline view. I quote from one newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Burma's military regime refused to make any concessions to Miss Aung San Suu Kyi's pro-democracy movement at yesterday's international convention.</PARA>
<PARA>This convention had been described as a convention that is flawed, fixed and, in its present form, not acceptable to the people of Burma. Of the 703 delegates to that convention, the pro-democracy movement was permitted to have 97 delegates there. It is a flawed convention and it is being used by SLORC to entrench themselves, to entrench the military in power. They grab power, and they are now rewriting the constitution to ensure that the military will remain in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fairly hard, I guess, for us to understand this, and it is going to be increasingly interesting throughout this coming year&mdash;only another month and we will be in the new year&mdash;which is the Year of Tourism in Burma. Already we see it. Members of parliament and others who travel by Qantas would notice in this month's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Way</EMPHASIS>, the magazine of Qantas, an article entitled `The land of the gold pagodas'. This presents a very sympathetic and flattering portrayal of Burma. As you thumb through other glossy magazines you get a similar picture.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a question for countries throughout the world today, as we all become more and more aware of human rights, that we should be judged by the way we treat our minorities. Rest assured that the way the minorities are treated in Burma is a matter of shame for the Burmese military regime, those entrenched colonels and other military people who have been in power there, who have grabbed power and have been illegally holding it. Far from being a paradise, unfortunately, Burma is a country where people's human rights and dignities are trampled under with jackboot ruthless authority. In Burma, increasingly, there is a trade in human misery. I was on the committee looking at this when we were told about the trade in young girls taken from the hill areas and often taken into Thailand. We all know of AIDS throughout Asia, throughout the world today. These young people are infected with this dreadful disease and then just sent back into that area. There is a trade in drugs.

I say to people that this coming year, the Year of Tourism in Burma, is not the year to visit Burma. I do not think any year is the year to visit Burma&mdash;at least, not until free and democratic elections are held and the rightful party is in government. When free and democratic elections were held in 1990, there was an overwhelming vote for the pro-democracy people. It was not a vote where, as sometimes happens around the world, there was a very narrow result. It was not like the divorce vote in Ireland over the weekend where there was a minute margin&mdash;I think it came down to 7,000 votes out of a couple of million.

Unfortunately, a lot of evidence had to be taken in camera because many of the people who spoke to us had relatives and friends in Burma, and we had to give them an undertaking that the evidence would be given in camera. What came out of that evidence was a picture of a ruthlessly frightening regime where there is no respect for human rights. I do not think that that is the way we should build an economy. We should not be investing there and most certainly we should not be visiting there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say, `What right has Australia to interfere in the human rights of other countries?' It is the same argument that they used about apartheid. I was surprised when this was brought down in the chamber a month or so ago that the Australia media was so interested that not one paper printed anything about it! A couple of days later, and this says something about the Australian media, a report&mdash;not nearly as thorough and as well researched as this one&mdash;was brought down in the United States and most of the papers in Australia carried extensive coverage of it. No Australian media thought the report that was brought down in this parliament worthy enough to make any comment on it at all. I think that says quite a lot about the Australian media and their lack of interest in so many issues. I suppose because various people did not write it for them they were too lazy to do their own work, to do a bit of research, go through the recommendations and see exactly what we were talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the right honourable member for New England, I would like to pay a particular tribute to Margaret Swieringa. I serve on several committees in this parliament and I do not know anyone who brings the dedication and the expertise to this field that Margaret Swieringa does. It is a field that she has particular feel for. She has a tremendous knowledge in the whole area of human rights and she is a very competent writer. I pay a particular tribute to her for the tremendous contribution that she has made to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to touch on some matters concerning ILO conventions in Burma. Burma has signed these conventions but has not adhered to them. Another point is that, because there is cheap labour in Burma, the Burmese authorities are forming contracts for labourers as seafarers, and using the wages paid to Burmese seafarers to assist their foreign currency situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a dissenting report, which is unfortunate because, in some respects, it weakens the strength of this report. When we are talking about human rights it is very difficult to criticise someone for putting in a dissenting report, and I have no personal animosity towards Senator Margetts. I like her as a person, but she has built up something of a reputation. I do not know about other committees she serves on, but with every report that comes down from the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee she feels compelled to put in a dissenting report. Often, her dissenting report indicates that she either has not followed the evidence very closely or is not really across the issues. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is an important report, should be widely read and should have a fairly wide international readership. The very fact that Senator Margetts has seen fit to put in a dissenting report really does lessen the value of this report. That is a great pity. On every committee I am on, we always strive, during the drafting stages, to reach unanimity. Sometimes, many of us who feel strongly on issues have to compromise. We always compromise so that we will get a unanimous report. When we are going to argue&mdash;not necessarily in Australia, but in international forums&mdash;it is easier to say, `Here is a unanimous report from the Australian party, covering all aspects of political opinion in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report. I commend it to every member of the parliament. I think every member should read it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned about this issue for many years. I think the record will show that I moved the very first motion in the House in support of Aung San Suu Kyi, years ago, when she was first arrested and we had the dreadful military situation in Burma. We gained some hope from her recent release, but now we see that progress, as the member for Throsby has indicated, is still extremely slow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things need to be said. Both members have referred to the issue of the indivisible nature of human rights. I have a lot to say on this matter in my new book, and I have said things about it in other speeches. We should not confuse questions of cultural diversity and differences in cultural traditions with the fact that we are one humanity and there are some fundamental human rights that are indivisible and must be sustained. That is a very important issue. As the honourable member for Throsby said, sometimes we forgot that when we were talking about South Africa in earlier times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that human rights are endangered when any nation does the sort of things that are happening at the moment in Burma, and we cannot accept that. This parliament has condemned it in a number of ways and the report has documented a lot of the issues. It is a great report in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not pull away from our commitment to human rights. I am hopeful of a revolution in Burma in which Aung San Suu Kyi will eventually come, through the democratic process, to take her rightful place as the leader of this nation because, if there were to be an election tomorrow, she would be overwhelmingly endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only those people who love democracy but also those people who love human rights should endorse the report and should endorse whatever the Australian government can do to support those who are suffering from abuses of human rights in Burma.

Our fundamental thing here is that we ought to get behind the report, we ought to refer to it and we ought to ensure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are very much aware of the views of parliamentarians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that we are about to deal with is a third from the same stable. Like all committees at the end of a parliament, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has produced a number of fairly significant publications, each of which is intended not just for domestic but for wider consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In opening on the report on Australia's relationship with Thailand, I totally endorse the comments by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I find it quite incredible that a report of such significance as that which we have just debated on Burma is virtually ignored by the media and yet, because the United States Congress produces a report that is nowhere near as adequate, they give it a great run. A few of our journalists need to understand that we are not slaves of the USA, that we do have a bit of independence and that we do have quite a deal of work of increasingly important relevance to the Australian community emerging from this parliament. It is quite stupid that the media manages to pick up what happens in the United States Congress and forgets that the Australian parliament produces work that has an Australian emphasis, an Australian idiom and is of far more consequence for the Australian electorate than anything that they might see in some report that comes out of the United States Congress. Indeed, if we want to influence the US Congress, the best way is to let them know that the work we produce is of a higher order than theirs&mdash;it often is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report relates to Australia's relations with Thailand. It has been a product of fairly extensive study by the foreign affairs subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I pay tribute to Mr Laurie Ferguson, who has been the chair of that committee, for the work he has done over the years and to Patrick Regan and those who helped in the preparation of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with an emphasis different from that that we have just dealt with. The report on Burma was really looking at human rights and the implications for Burma's integration into, particularly, our part of the world as a result of the regime that is currently in control there, SLORC, and the attitude it has adopted towards individuals. This one is of a different order altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kingdom of Thailand is a very significant country. The kingdom has contributed greatly towards the formation and development of ASEAN. Thailand was a prime mover in the establishment of the Cairns Group, which was so important in the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which led to the establishment of the World Trade Organisation. Thailand has been a friend of Australia's for many years, and in World War II, tragically, many Australians lost their lives serving on the Burma-Thailand railway as prisoners of war of the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this report goes into the concepts of our relationship in more depth, I would be wrong if I did not mention that, following the visit of the foreign affairs subcommittee to Thailand, we referred to a number of the matters that we pick up again in this report. In particular, that early relationship, the relationship during World War II, is of tremendous consequence. We were fortunate, as a group of parliamentarians, in being able to go to Hellfire Pass. We saw where the ashes of Weary Dunlop were spread. We saw something in today's environment of what must have been absolute hell for that generation of Australians, whose life and death and service we have been commemorating in the Australia Remembers services around Australia these past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we remember that that heritage is something that is not just a matter of attending a shrine in Australia or visiting a war grave. It is something that is living and ongoing. The important part about our relationship with Thailand is that it was tremendously important at that time. In a way, I have always felt it gave Australia a particular association with Asia&mdash;not peculiarly with Thailand but with Burma, about which we have just been talking, and of course with Singapore and Malaya. It is an ongoing part of the change from Australia being oriented to Europe to Australia being oriented to this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our relationship with Thailand is an ongoing one. It is not something that is just a product of Thailand being a very populous state with a rising standard of living, as one of the new tigers, as they call the country sometimes. It is a country that is said to be the land of smiles. It is a country where the monarchy has incredible stature, and we have referred to that in this report. The monarchy unites Thailand in a remarkable way. I remember that during my several visits to Thailand during the Vietnam War it was quite amazing going to Thailand and then going to other countries in Asia. The people all were united in a way that, sadly, has not been so in many of the other countries of Asia. I think that it is important to respect and understand the sensitivities of the Thai people to their monarchy, and the very high esteem in which members of the royal family are held there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well not be the way that we see our monarchy. Indeed, it has been sad that some media have tended to compare our relationship with our monarchy with the relations of the Thai people with their monarchy. Not only is that an affront to the Thais but it helps to give the Thais a feeling that we do not understand them. That is unfortunate, because it is tremendously important that we understand the differences in attitudes of people in other countries. This report, we hope, will help towards improving that relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have opened by talking about those issues is that I was fortunate in meeting a delegation from the foreign affairs committee of Thailand last week. There were only Senator Baden Teague and I in town, and I had quite a long session with them. They expressed reservations to me about Australia's attitude to Thailand. They spoke about newspaper comments, they spoke about media attitudes towards their monarchy and they spoke about the concern they have that we try and see them through our own eyes without understanding that they see themselves differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to them that this report is not intended for us to tell them what to do; it is more to promote an understanding in Australia of the importance of our relationship with Thailand. Thailand is a tremendously important neighbour. Unfortunately, because its language is complex and its culture is different, it tends to have been played down. In our recommendations we have picked up how important it is that we maintain training and education in the Thai language. It is not now one of the major languages taught in Australia and I understand it is extraordinarily difficult to learn. Yet I have a daughter who spent some years in Thailand and is a Thai linguist and she says that the language, once you have learnt it, is very much like any other language. It is a living language, a spoken language, and one that enables you, simply by having a facility in that language, to communicate through a wide range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made recommendations in our report about funding a number of institutions to ensure that there is a continued understanding of the Thai language and culture in our country. In particular, we have expressed our concern that the National Thai Studies Centre at the Australian National University should continue to be funded. It is tremendously important that we maintain opportunities to develop Thai studies and an understanding of Thai culture, not just at the ANU but around Australia at the tertiary and secondary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand is an important country in our region. While many Thais speak English, it is not sufficient for us to go there and be totally ignorant not just of their language but of their culture. There are sensitivities which are important. For example, it was said to me that while we might regard some issues as being bad manners, such as a young man putting his feet on a table and pointing his feet at his parents, that would be a total affront to a person in Thailand. We might not see that as something unusual. Indeed, many of us in our offices and in the privacy of our homes&mdash;and some, sadly, in even more public places&mdash;adopt that posture without thinking. But, to a Thai, that is a total affront. We need to understand that they see things differently, that they do not see and feel things as we do. We would do well to remember that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preservation of these facilities around Australia to learn of Thai culture and to learn the Thai language is absolutely critical. I am particularly concerned that the federal government apparently is considering reducing, or eliminating altogether, the funding that is provided for the Thai language centre at the ANU. If that should be so&mdash;and we made comments about this in our earlier report&mdash;it would be a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only in the teaching of Thai language but also in the communication between our countries that I am worried about where we go. This same delegation I saw the other day mentioned to me their concern that we are apparently intending to cut down some of the ABC funding for both television and radio in the Thai language. If that were so it would be a great tragedy because Radio Australia has provided an excellent Thai language program for a long time. I think it is essential that it be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in those countries often have learnt English through the broadcasting services that we have provided in the past and, hopefully, can learn a little of the positive as well as the negative side of our society through television programs. We are foolish if we just want to broadcast or televise programs that might suit our culture. We are not really trying to get through to the tourists in the five-star, four-star or even three-star hotels. What we are trying to do is to ensure that they understand the Australian community, the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are far more benefits from having programs that run across our language, our culture, our educational emphases, our attitude to democracy and our attitude to human rights. All these things are matters that go on the ABC. If it should be that there is to be a reduction in the ABC's international services that affected our Thai services, I believe that it would be a great tragedy&mdash;not just now, but in the continuity of the relationship between our countries. I was most concerned to hear of this and hope that the recommendations we have made in this report on the maintenance of Thai language programs will be noted by the government. Even though I know funding is scarce, it is essential that the ABC be directed to maintain those outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In education, we have spoken predominantly in the report about teaching Thai language and culture in Australia. I have to confess&mdash;to my chagrin&mdash;that I had not heard of the University of Mahanakorn until I went to Thailand. Because that was the case, I want to just comment briefly about it. </PARA>

I hope that, when we look at how we assist countries like Thailand, we maintain our relationship with such universities because it can help a great deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is running out. I want to talk about one other subject before I conclude, and that is the drug trade and the work being done by the Australian Federal Police and in the refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border and generally along the Thai border. Thailand has been a host country for refugees from Cambodia and Laos and it certainly is still, sadly, a host to refugees from Burma. It is terribly important that we maintain our effort to contain the drug trade. The measures that have been adopted to try and develop alternative crops are well worth while, but it is a program which needs to be ongoing. We need to coordinate our effort with the Americans, but we also need to make sure we coordinate our effort with the non-government agencies. There is a great deal that can be achieved by doing that. From the little we saw of the programs, they have been remarkably successful. But, sadly, the trade in women and in drugs continues and a great deal more needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final observation is with respect to the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok itself. A great deal can be done for the relationship between Australia and other countries through those who are resident Australians. I commend the members of that chamber, although their politics and their emphasis may not always be the same as Australia's, in that they sometimes have localised concerns. We were very fortunate on this visit&mdash;one of several visits I have had&mdash;to have met members of that chamber. They do a great job, and I believe that the government needs to work very closely with them, as they do with the NGOs, for we have a very worthwhile extension of Australia in those who are Australians and who see things through our eyes in the work they do in countries such as Thailand. I commend this report to the parliament. It has a great deal within it which should be accepted by the federal government. </PARA>

These reports all really show the importance of parliamentary committees such as the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I only joined this committee in June of this year, it has been an important time for any committee. The quality of these reports is certainly in tune with the high quality of reports that come out of this parliament all the time from the committees. That does great credit to the staff of the various committees in this parliament, and I commend them particularly for the quality of the reports before us at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you actually led a parliamentary delegation to Thailand and Singapore just recently, and I had the pleasure of joining you on that occasion. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) was your deputy, and Senator Watson and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) were part of that delegation as well. It fell out very nicely that we had the opportunity to visit Thailand and that I have the opportunity to say a few words about this report today. The foreword to the report on Australia's relations with Thailand says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was stated in the Foreword to the report on relations with Indonesia, the Committee does not believe a credible report can be produced on a country unless a body of its members have seen something of that nation and its people. The opportunity to survey Australian development assistance projects and listen to Thailand's politicians, business people and public servants was of central importance to this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>Members of this committee have obviously visited the country over the last couple of years, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has mentioned. Having recently visited Thailand, we can add to those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we say here is that the relationship with neighbours like Thailand is very important, and I think it can only be promoted by such bilateral visits. We had the opportunity to meet fellow members of parliament and the business community in Thailand and to look at some of Australia's aid programs in that area. We certainly had the opportunity to visit a camp on the Myanmar border, which I mentioned in the main chamber when the report on Burma was actually tabled. We went to a camp there that had some 6,000 people, Karen people, who were refugees. In that part of the world they are known as misplaced people, I think, for various reasons. That was an eye-opener to us, I believe, in seeing the problems that Thailand faces in that relationship with Burma and how those people are accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This all develops the problems that we need to address when we are talking about our neighbours like Thailand. I have got to admit that I was particularly pleased at the warmth with which we were greeted on that occasion. Once again it adds to the relationship that we have with Asia, and it is very important that we had the opportunity to go through and see all those things on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might look at the aid projects there. In particular, we had the opportunity to look at some of the health aid assistance that we are giving to Thailand, particularly when it comes to the HIV-AIDS problem, which is a very significant problem in Thailand, as acknowledged by the government. If Australia's aid can help in any way in addressing those sorts of health problems, it is certainly money well spent. I would like to commend the people that we saw on that occasion, who were working so closely in assisting those people with something that is certainly a big problem. In the briefing notes prepared for us, that was highlighted as one of the biggest issues there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report and its recommendations. It does acknowledge the difficulties there and recommends a continuation of that support, but I think that what is probably often overlooked is the opportunities for Australian business in dealing with Thailand. That is a two-way go as well. It may be recalled that we visited the lignite mine project at Mae Moh with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. There was actually an Australian there&mdash;the project manager, Max Brown, who has been there for something like 12 years. He has done a tremendous job in promoting Australia. This is part of our aid program but there are mutual benefits in this particular aid program. I suggest that Australian business is benefiting very much from the relationship we have there through Australian assistance and the mutual benefits that come back through Australian trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the mining industry, Australians have a lot to offer, as many members in this place know. I notice the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) here; he knows about the interest in the coal industry from his own electorate as well. The opportunities that have been made available there for Australian business to play an important role in assisting Thailand need to be highlighted, and the work of someone like Max Brown is particularly important because it really puts Australia on the world stage. I will read from the report that Max gave us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The biggest business directed towards the Australian industry is in the materials handling system, where the Australian mining industry suppliers are competing with mainly European companies for the contract to supply, install and commission. Australian finance organisations have been involved, such as EFIC, to provide the Australian suppliers with competitive finance packages.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something that I think we often forget about the competition that is going on there. Max Brown told us how he competes almost on a daily basis with, for instance, the Germans, who would love to be in there doing as a good job as the Australians, but they obviously cannot be as effective as the Australians. The overall management there, of course, is run very well by the Thais. They address a lot of the environmental issues. We are getting more environmentally conscious in Australia with our mines as well as with redeveloping the sites afterwards. We had the opportunity to see the good work that was actually going on there in redeveloping those sites and being environmentally conscious. I think that was particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly turn to another area which is of significance to the relationship between Australia and Thailand. That is the Thai-Burma railway, which is so infamously known, when we think about people like Weary Dunlop in particular, and the Hellfire Pass memorial project which was announced in the last budget. I believe that the longstanding good relations we have had with Thailand come through in the support that they are giving to the recognition of Australians who have gone before us in that particular conflict. It was obviously a horrible situation. I am sure you would recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, when we had the opportunity to wander down Hellfire Pass, the stress and strain of just walking down there and climbing out of the place. I know you were not well on that occasion, with a virus, but I would suggest that a lot of the POWs who were there would have been suffering much worse health problems than we would have on that occasion. It was certainly an eye-opener to me to actually walk down there and to look at the memorial to Weary Dunlop. </PARA>

I pay tribute to the Thai government for the courtesy that they paid us right throughout our visit to Thailand. I am not sure we will get a chance to speak on another occasion when our report is actually tabled, but I want to put that on record today.

It is something that we need to accommodate and work through as we deal with developing good relationships in Asia. We are very well respected, I believe, as a country in Thailand and I think that we cannot but help to maintain and build on those relations by having our committees, such as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, look at that relationship, foster that relationship and highlight any difficulties that we see, because that only helps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be careful in how we deal with those things, because dealing with another country is very sensitive and it is not for us to tell another country how to run its show. But if we see things where we can offer assistance in some way, particularly in relation to that health area where Australia has expertise, and on the education side as well, then there are great opportunities for us to continue to maintain and foster those good relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Thai people take the opportunity to educate their children in Australia for obvious reasons. It is a preferred place for many of them. It was surprising the number of people that we spoke to on that occasion who were educated in Australia. They have benefited greatly from that in making friends with Australia and, of course, learning our language rather than our learning their language. The language barrier that the right honourable member for New England highlighted before is certainly a problem for us. It is something that Australia needs to be very conscious of and I think that it is one language that we should be promoting in our schools if we are to continue to foster those relationships. All those areas are ones that we should promote, and I believe that a lot of the recommendations in the report do pick up on those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of labour relations is something that is always very sensitive for members, certainly from my side of the House. With building sites in Thailand, for instance, one would suggest that there are always ways to improve. We can offer some advice and some expertise in developing a lot of those things, but on a two-way basis where we are careful how we develop those good relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support this report. Again, I commend the staff of the committee for the three reports that have been tabled today. They are obviously of the very high quality that we maintain in this place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The aggregated total forward development cooperation commitments, determined as at 30 September 1995, for each of the financial years 1996/97 to 2000/01 are listed in Attachment I. These are recorded against AusAID's appropriation structure; country programs, global programs and corporate services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that Australia's commitment to food aid is a special case. A liability has been incurred through our commitment to the Food Aid Convention of 300,000 tonnes of wheat or wheat equivalent per annum for the period 1995/96 to 1997/98. There is no specific allocation for food aid as such. Rather, our Food Aid Commitment is met through country appropriations, emergency and refugee appropriations, as well as through the World Food Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitments have been recorded in accordance with the accounting definitions specified by the Department of Finance in its guidelines to Commonwealth agencies for the preparation of annual Financial Statements tabled in Parliament. Obligations are recorded as liabilities, commitments and agreements equally proportionately unperformed (AEPUs). These definitions are explained at Attachment II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using these definitions, the levels of forward commitment as at 30 September 1995 are as follows: 1996/97&mdash;$1,055 million; 1997/98&mdash;$908 million; 1998/99&mdash;$678 million; 1999/2000&mdash;$595 million; 2000/01&mdash;$481 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other programs/activities which are not covered by these definitions and therefore not recorded for the purpose of the Financial Statements, but which also place a high degree of obligation on Australia for moral or other reasons. While there are strong expectations that such funding will continue, these activities have not been included as development cooperation commitments for these Questions on Notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These other obligations include core contributions to United Nations development organisations (eg. UNICEF, United Nations Development Fund, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The contributions are voluntary and not covered by legislation as in the case of multilateral development banks, nor are they covered by the `assessed' formulae used for other UN bodies. There is, however, a strong expectation internationally and domestically that Australia's contributions to these organisations will continue, reflecting Australia's role as a good international citizen and the principle of burden-sharing with other donors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The category also covers: allocations to meet commitments where the Government has pledged support for specific programs (eg. Prime Ministerial multiyear pledges for development cooperation programs in Vietnam and Cambodia); provision for refugee and emergency relief; funding for Development Import Finance Facility projects where activities have been agreed between Australia and recipient governments; funding for the AusAID/Non-government Organisation Cooperation Program; funding for volunteer programs; and support for regional organisations such as the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. There is also an expectation of maintenance of support for country programs in key regions such as the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1996/97, the total value of these `strong expectations' is estimated to be $363 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A detailed supplementary paper of 127 pages, which outlines all forward commitments, disaggregated by country program, global program and corporate services; and further, by activity, value and nature of commitment has been provided to the Honourable Member. Each commitment type is reported on separate schedules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Under the Development Import Finance Facility a contractual commitment occurs when the implementing contractor receives a formal offer to undertake the project. At 30 September 1995 no contractual arrangements were in place under the Development Import Finance Facility for project funding in 1996/97 and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, however, a high degree of obligation on the Australian Government because (i) a pipeline of projects has been agreed bilaterally at officials level with China, Indonesia, Nepal, India, the Philippines and Vietnam; and (ii) on this basis commercial contract negotiations between contractors and recipient governments have commenced.  Details of individual contractors, prior to the award of contracts, are commercial-in-confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There were no contractual arrangements in place under the Development Import Finance Facility for the period 1996/97 to 2000/01 as at 30 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, expectations based on requests on hand to a total value of $267.9 million, of which it is anticipated that some $60 million </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be funded during the remainder of the 1995/96 financial year and the balance funded in out years. Funding is provided as contracts are signed in any year up to the total annual allocation for the Development Import Finance Facility program. There are expectations of funding from the countries concerned and Australian contractors for these projects and, on that basis, contract negotiations have commenced. It should be noted that not all the identified projects will necessarily proceed to formal offer by AusAID. The latter is contingent upon satisfactory appraisal by AusAID on developmental grounds, including an assessment against OECD criteria for mixed credits and the satisfactory conclusion to negotiations between the Australian supplier and the buyer in the recipient country. Attachment III provides the list of Development Import Finance Facility projects agreed with recipient governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) Individual details of applicants for Development Import Finance Facility projects are commercial-in-confidence up until the date when contracts are awarded; (b) and (c) no contractual arrangements were in place for the period 1996/97 to 2000/01 as at 30 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(a) The percentage of projected overall development cooperation funds that are committed, in accordance with categories defined for the Financial Statements, during financial years 1996/97 to 2000/01 are listed against the overall program totals in Attachment I. The total commitment as at 30 September 1995, in percentage terms, assuming 1995/96 aid levels are maintained in real terms, are: 1996/97&mdash;65 per cent; 1997/98&mdash;54 per cent; 1998/99&mdash;39 per cent; 1999/2000&mdash;33 per cent; 2000/01&mdash;26 per cent.</PARA>
