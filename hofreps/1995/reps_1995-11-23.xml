<PARA>The motion will be seconded by the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). The motion on Cyprus I have just placed before the House this morning is a matter of considerable interest to all members. Last week the President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, visited Australia and met with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here in Canberra and with a number of ministers and members of both sides of the House in Sydney and Melbourne. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to talk with Mr Clerides and hear his views about the continuing problems in Cyprus 21 years after the invasion by Turkey in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 20 years I have taken a keen interest in a just resolution for the people of Cyprus and their struggle against the Turkish invaders. For Australia, Cyprus is not just a small island in the eastern Mediterranean; it is also the ancestral home of some 50,000 to 60,000 Cypriot Australians. As members may be aware, the Cypriot Australian community is the second largest Cypriot community outside of Cyprus itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a long association with members of the Cypriot community in Sydney, and to me the cause of Cyprus is just and special. I have visited Cyprus on a number of occasions for discussions with both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and as a member of the International Parliamentary Union Committee to monitor the situation in Cyprus have continued that dialogue with politicians on both sides of the green line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Clerides's visit was an occasion for him to appraise the Cypriot community in Australia, and the wider community, of the current situation in Cyprus, particularly his proposal for demilitarisation of the island under the auspices of the UN. It was also an occasion to highlight the Cypriot problem in the Australian press. This is an issue in which Australia should not only be taking an interest but also leading the way because we have a unique knowledge of both communities, and also because time is running out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world has ignored the calamity on Cyprus for too long. Old conflicts such as the Cold War and new conflicts such as the Gulf War and then Bosnia have distracted the attention of the United States and Europe. Some might say it was convenient for the United States to be so distracted, because of the strategic value of Turkey on the southern flank of the old Eastern bloc and as a staging post during the Gulf War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years, particularly since the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the former Soviet Union, one would have thought there would have been greater international interest in dealing with the injustice on the island of Cyprus. If the Europeans and the Americans have forgotten Cyprus, Australia should not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my intention in the House today, in proposing this motion, to draw attention to the issue of Cyprus&mdash;to put it on the agenda for the Australian Parliament, and to have our government continue the fight for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. After 21 years, it is time for the withdrawal of all foreign troops. It is time for a lasting political settlement. It is also time that Cyprus was ruled by Cypriots, for Cypriots. The Cypriot issue is the longest running sore in Europe. It is an absolute disgrace that the international community have allowed Turkey to occupy over a third of Cyprus for 21 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members would recall that in 1974, after a coup deposed the Makarios government, Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus above the so-called `Attila' or `Green' Line, running from Morphou to Famagusta. A puppet government was established, declaring itself to be the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which was recognised only by Turkey. In 1983, the TFSC unilaterally declared independence as the TRNC, or Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but again was only recognised by Turkey and the declaration was condemned by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greek Cypriots were expelled to the south of Cyprus by the Turkish occupiers in the north. Over 150,000 Cypriots became refugees in their own country. Turkey then set about repopulating the north with people from Annatolia. An estimated 70,000 settlers were imported from Turkey to colonise the north, while it seems that 45,000 Turkish Cypriots have left the island. Over 1,600 people are considered to be `missing persons'. Over 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in Cyprus. They are the statistics, and they are astounding for a nation the size of Cyprus with a population of around 730,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1968 successive UN Secretaries-General have been involved in convening intercommunal talks to find a solution. A so-called `set of ideas' was developed as a blueprint in 1992. The set of ideas suggests a framework for an agreement between the two communities. The constitution of Cyprus would be amended to provide for a bicommunal and bizonal federation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidence building and political will are central to bringing both sides together. The latest Security Council resolution last year, No. 939, reaffirms this. Today the Australian House of Representatives urges all parties involved to actively work towards the implementation of security council resolution No. 939. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the IPU committee to monitor the situation in Cyprus, I am pleased to say that that committee has managed to encourage a number of small confidence building meetings between the political parties on the island, the most recent on 25 September 1995 at the IPU Conference in Bucharest. This is encouraging, but there is still no sign of a resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Clerides, in 1993 and again in 1994, wrote to the UN Secretary-General proposing a negotiated settlement through demilitarisation but, due it seems to a lack of political will on the Turkish Cypriot side, there has been no progress in achieving this. In fact, a report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council in June this year noted `the excessive level of armaments and forces in Cyprus and the rate at which they are being strengthened are a cause of serious concern.' The Secretary-General went on to note `the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus' and called for a withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces, as described in the set of ideas. The same report noted that Cyprus is probably the most heavily militarised part of Europe. For a small country it is a disgraceful circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the CHOGM meeting last week in Auckland, the paragraph on Cyprus in the final communique again expressed support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus and urged the UN to take resolute action on the necessary measures for a speedy implementation of the UN resolutions. CHOGM also expressed full support for President Clerides's proposal for demilitarisation and called for the speedy withdrawal of Turkish forces and settlers, as well as the return of refugees and an accounting for missing persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Wednesday, 15 November, was the 12th anniversary of the setting up of the rogue state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The thin green line separating the north and south of the island is a very real dividing line. People have been forced out of their homes, and are not allowed to return. One of the saddest things about the occupation by Turkish troops in the north is the number of Turkish Cypriots who have now left the island. The Turkish Cypriot population on the island is probably the lowest it has ever been in the history of the Turkish people on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The city of Famagusta, one of the jewels in the Mediterranean, is deserted. Famagusta is a metaphor for this whole sorry issue. Founded in ancient times, it has seen many invasions and it has survived. But now it is barren and empty, like the resolve of Turkey to come to the table on this dispute. To stand on the hillside overlooking this ancient city and see it windswept and deserted overwhelms you with a great sense of sadness. Under Turkish control this jewel of the Mediterranean has gone to rack and ruin. That is something that anyone who goes to see that part of the world can only be saddened by. The emptiness of Famagusta contrasts markedly with the economic prosperity in the southern part of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does not recognise the rogue state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We recognise the government of the republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. Australia has been actively involved in efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the problem, and we firmly support the UN Security Council's resolutions. Australia has contributed to the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus. Currently, there are 20 Australian policemen on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said for many years that there must be a single state of Cyprus with a unified sovereignty and citizenship. Within such a unified state, there must be political equality  between the two communities and no union with any other country. In short, it would be a Cyprus ruled by Cypriots for Cypriots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular concern of mine for some time has been for Australians of Greek Cypriot origin who lost their property in northern Cyprus after the Turkish invasion in 1974. Last year in this House, I raised the question of these people's rights. The answer was that the Turkish Cypriot administration would accept property claims from third party states but not from people of Greek or Greek Cypriot origin. These people are Australian citizens, and they were citizens of this country prior to the invasion in 1974. They have made a claim as Australian citizens but have been rejected by the Turkish authorities. This is a disgraceful expropriation of their property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, after the Turkish invasion in 1974, people with Anglo-Saxon names who were British or American passport holders at the time of the invasion were not treated in the same cavalier manner. It was only if your name was a Greek name that you lost your property. My family came to this country three generations ago from Ireland. It would be the same as the British authorities in Northern Ireland, from where my grandfather came, saying that I could not inherit any property there because my name was Irish. It is just a disgraceful set of circumstances that no-one is willing to address. It should be addressed urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Turkish government wants to show some form of reasonableness in this issue, it should restore the property of these Australian citizens as a show of good faith to this country, which has provided a home to many people who have come here from Turkey. A small thing such as that&mdash;for the Turkish authorities, it is only a small thing&mdash;would be a very important part of these confidence building measures. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the background to the struggle for justice in Cyprus which has been going on for 21 years. The Australian government has not sat on its hands, but we need to continue to press the case for Cyprus internationally. With the prospect of Cyprus joining the European Union, it is surely now the time for the international community to turn its collective attention to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus and to bringing the communities of Cyprus together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the terrible situation where, of two candidate countries for the European Union, one has troops on the soil of the other. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, everyone thought that the world could turn its eyes to resolving some of these other ongoing issues, thus placing Cyprus high on the international agenda. Unfortunately, it nearly gets there, and then something else comes along to take it off the agenda. There is now a window of opportunity for the world to solve the injustice in Cyprus. It would be irresponsible and immoral for us to ignore the situation in Cyprus by leaving it to the slow processes of the UN to resolve. Do we have to wait for bloodshed before any action is taken by the international community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 21 years there is a need for goodwill and a new resolve to work actively towards a lasting and peaceful settlement based on UN Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 939. There is a need to recognise, as President Clerides and the US Congress have recognised, `that the ultimate total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus would meet the security concerns of all parties involved, would enhance prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of this dispute regarding Cyprus, would benefit all of the people of Cyprus, and merits international support'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 21 years, the refugees and the families of the 1,619 persons who disappeared during the conflict cry out to us for justice for Cyprus. The international community has a duty to heed that call. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) has had to say. The situation in Cyprus is an international tragedy. Not only does one need to look at the current situation, which the gentleman expressed and described so accurately, but one also has to ask why this problem has been around for so long and why there is so much intransigence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with so many of these international difficulties, whether it is Northern Ireland, Bosnia, or whatever, the history goes back a long way. The underlying reason why these situations do not get resolved is probably the fundamental lack of trust, often based on good reason on both sides, which means that people cannot come to the table and resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cyprus has a history of conquest and minority groups. Throughout the ages it has been a staging post in the centre of the Mediterranean. In fact, I stood in Famagusta when it was a thriving and prosperous city. If you look at Famagusta today and compare it to when I saw it 25 years ago or more, there is no question that it is an unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation. I agree with the honourable gentleman: we have to take every possible step to resolve those sorts of situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in Cyprus is not as current as that of the previous speaker. I lived in Cyprus for three years from 1968 to 1971. I was there as a member of the British air force&mdash;this was after the island had independence; as we all know, Britain retained some small territorial land there as sovereign territory&mdash;and worked at Episkopi but in fact lived in Limassol, which was in the republic. I travelled extensively through the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the military action from Turkey had not taken place then, there were two clear parts of the island. You went across the green line to go from the Turkish part to the Greek part and vice versa. There were armed incidents on a regular basis, but this was before the major Turkish military action. Therefore, if you like, it was one of the better times in recent Cypriot history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did I have the chance to travel and work there but I also had the opportunity to mix socially with Cypriots&mdash;I went to their weddings and I had Cypriots of both Greek and Turkish background working for me. At that stage, it seemed that there were an awful lot of problems that were going to take a long time to resolve because of the background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many changes since, and I am told by a number of friends and colleagues who still maintain regular contacts and who have travelled there that I probably would not recognise much of the Cyprus that I knew. Particularly in the Limassol area, as I understand it, the economic development has been phenomenal. In Paphos, which was a little country town, you went to a restaurant to look at the pelicans. It was a quaint place, and I understand it is almost unrecognisable in terms of its development and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that I have not had recent contact with Cyprus, but it is important to understand that the background of this problem has its genesis from the days when I was in Cyprus and before. The problem very largely came to the fore after independence. When the island was divided in 1974, it was specifically triggered by the Greek directed coup d'etat. We now have this north-south divide, this Turkish-Greek divide. In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was proclaimed. Of course, that is recognised only by Turkey. It is appropriate that we do not recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, both halves of Cyprus operate under a democratic process, although they have slightly different structures, and both function as free economies. But the Greek Cypriots undoubtedly are more successful. The Turkish part of the island relies very heavily on Turkey. It is important for anybody who has not been to Cyprus to understand that roughly 78 per cent of the population is Greek Cypriot and 18 per cent is Turkish Cypriot.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, things were fairly harmonious until about 1959 when British independence was achieved. In fact, there have been peacekeepers there since 1964. The United Nations Secretary-General, whoever it has happened to be, has been working pretty hard to resolve this problem on an ongoing basis, particularly since 1968. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we understand the terms of UN resolution No. 939. The world community accepts that it is going to be the basis on which the solution of the Cyprus problem must be based. Paragraph 2 of resolution No. 939, which goes to the nub of the situation, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "on a State of Cyprus with single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal communities as described in the relevant Security Council Resolutions in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Originally, both communities of Turkey and Greece signed off on that principle some years ago, but recently it would be fair to say that the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot communities have been moving increasingly to a position of looking for two sovereign states. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said fairly recently with some exasperation and frustration that he felt the Turkish Cypriots had shown a lack of cooperation and goodwill in resolving the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That problem had its generation a long time ago and has gone through several generations of people. It is based on issues that may seem remote to us today but which were very real to those who lived on the island. The situation was the same as that in Northern Ireland, where in my view one community which was in the majority treated the minority community as second-class citizens until that minority felt that it had no option but to resort to arms. I do not condone what the IRA has done, but what I am saying is that there were reasons why that pressure was applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Cyprus and before, there was no question that those of the Turkish minority were treated in very many respects as second-class citizens. I remember talking to one of the leading Turkish Cypriots of the day when there had been a number of historical incidents. He said, `The next time there's a problem, we will go all the way; I would rather die than have this situation continue.' The reality was that it was manifest in all sorts of ways. The reality was that, if  you were a Turkish Cypriot, you were not allowed to build a house other than with mud bricks. As is the case in our country with Aboriginal people, there were little discriminations, little pinpricks, that daily caused the irritations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very early on there was very significant Greek military power and the Turks felt threatened in the same way that today there is very substantial Turkish military power and the Greeks feel threatened. Today, one of the problems is that the Turkish side holds a larger percentage of the land than the population can possibly justify. There is the problem of refugees who have been driven out of the north and want to go back and there are issues of compensation, which the member from Watson so graphically described. There is the problem of European Union membership. Turkey, Greece and Cyprus itself are looking to attain European Union membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that, whilst we condemn the idea of incorporation of part of Cyprus into mainland Turkey, which has certainly been on the agenda of some on the Turkish side, part of the agenda in my time there was enosis on the Greek side, which talked about incorporation of part or the whole of Cyprus into Greece. It is not just that today the Turks want to incorporate part of the island into mainland Turkey. Twenty-five years ago, frankly, the boot was on the other foot. It is because of that history that many of the Turks today feel threatened by some of the moves that are made, even if they are made in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the problem of the Turkish mainland settlers who have now gone to Cyprus and are increasing the numbers of the Turkish Cypriot population. Undoubtedly, the Turks are in greater economic need of resolving the situation. The Turks feel that if there is demilitarisation they will again be swamped by the larger number of the Greek Cypriot population. The Greeks fear confederation of part of Cyprus with Turkey because they feel they will then be swamped. It is all about each side having a fear of being swamped by the other side. It goes back in history and it goes back in blood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the terrible things is that, therefore, both sides are spending so much money on defence, whereas they should actually be spending that money on creating a better future for the next generation on what is a wonderful and beautiful island that has tremendous economic potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not easy. We do need some confidence building measures. I think I agree with the previous speaker that Europe and the European community have not taken the issue seriously enough. If over the 25 years since I was there the European community had put a bit more effort into resolving the problems, then there is no doubt in my mind that this problem could have been and should have been solved a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the view that if Northern Ireland can be sorted out, and it is&mdash;it has had, frankly, an even worse bloodbath history than Cyprus&mdash;and if Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia and the former Yugoslavia can be sorted out, as we all hope and pray that they are at the present time, then with international will and international commitment, we should damned well be able to sort out the problem in Cyprus. I think it is, in fact, one of the long running festering sores in the international community which has not received its share of attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's position is to support sovereignty. We do not recognise the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We provide support for the UN and we do that in a very practical sense, through our police presence as part of the UNFICYP force. That force was there when I was in Cyprus for three-odd years. Those policemen do an outstanding job, often in dangerous and difficult circumstances. I think every single member of that force is to be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure a year or two ago of attending something of a reunion of a number of those policemen. They have actually published a little book of the history of the Australian police involvement at UNFICYP. They have the pictures and they know who went where when. They are a very tight knit community. Those men have served their country, Cyprus and the international community extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously because of time I cannot go through the motion clause by clause; I have to agree with the mover of the motion that all of the things on the agenda are things we should very much support. We do need to reaffirm support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus in the way it is articulated here and in the UN resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do want to see the removal of foreign troops because the presence in fact heightens a lot of the tensions. It keeps the distrust going.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, one supports and heartily endorses the applauding of the contribution of the Australian peacekeepers. There is concern that after more than two decades of division on the island there is still no lasting settlement. This means that we are condemning, and the situation is condemning, young Cypriots to less than they are entitled to expect for their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General's longstanding efforts.

And so I could go on. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The connection between the Greeks and Australians is one baptised in blood. In this, the 50th year of the end of the Second World War, we have rightly remembered those who died and who served. This remembrance has been bipartisan and I think this is the way for the future of our country. We must also remember and be thankful for those not of our land who fought for us, who helped us and who died saving us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cyprus and Greece are not foreign to Australia or to Australians. Our pasts are closely connected, our presence is one of unity and our future is one of hope. These bonds between Australians and Greeks were forged for ever in the fires of the Second World War. Australian troops fought and died for Greek liberty. Greek patriots hid Australian troops from the Nazis and often paid with their lives for doing so. This blood bond is unbreakable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greek virtues of courage and iron determination have forged a people who will not accept defeat. The Greek people have a sense of their own dignity and self-confidence that makes them the best of all possible allies. Australia has been blessed thousands of times over by the Greek migration to Australia and, as they stood up by us in the past, so must we stand by them in pursuit of justice for Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have intimate knowledge of the experience of both Greeks and Turks. Each of these countries has sent thousands of its sons and daughters to Australia as migrants and they have enriched our country, our lives and helped to build our future. They and we are now one. Our successful bipartisan policy of multiculturalism has strengthened Australia and Australia's tradition for tolerance has calmed the waters of ancient hostilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am led to believe that Australia is held in high regard by both Cyprus and Turkey and this should embolden us to offer our services for settlement of the present unsatisfactory arrangements on Cyprus. The motion before the House captures the spirit that is needed to break the present 20-year impasse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion recognises the integral unity of the island. We are opposed to division. The motion calls for the removal of all foreign troops. We are opposed to occupation. The motion calls for the recognition of the negotiations based on the UN resolutions. We are opposed to the continuance of the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a world of very serious political and social problems, the Cyprus problem should not exist. It came about as a result of particular problems in the 1960s and the 1970s. The world has changed dramatically since those days. Greece, Cyprus and Turkey have changed and now it is time for the problem to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In solving this problem it would be extremely useful for all parties to remove some small stumbling blocks. In particular, I can see a great usefulness in each side giving a clear and truthful account of the people who have gone missing since July 1974. We all know that dreadful things happen in the heat of battle and that we might do things that we are later ashamed of, and in these circumstances it is understandable that people may seek to hide or deny these shameful actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road to peace needs the problem to be removed and, however painful it must be, the truth must be told about the fate and the current whereabouts of all missing on each side. There is no avoiding this painful act of contrition. There can be no end to the war without it. This problem is, I think, a suitable field of endeavour for the religious authorities of the two communities. They can work apart from the politicians to produce a climate of telling the truth about the missing&mdash;all the missing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another stumbling block is the various legal and property cases which exist as a result of July 1974 events. Surely a neutral legal jurisdiction can be found to begin the process of settling these cases. These problems of the missing persons and the stolen property are especially troublesome to Australians who have taken an interest in Cyprus. I have written to the foreign minister and I have spoken on every occasion concerning the 1,619 missing at the hands of the Turkish army since 1974. Whatever the merits of the Turkish invasion in 1974, those merits have long gone after 20 years. The outstanding matters of life and property must be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is improper and outrageous for anyone to use the question of missing persons as a negotiating card. The current behaviour of Turkey is not in its own interest. As for Australia, we must stand firm in our support for the justice of the Greek cause. This government has in fact been a hardline supporter of the Greek community in Cyprus and a reliable supporter of Greece in recent years. I am confident that our support will not waver in the future. Mine certainly will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that every person living on Cyprus would prefer to have the Australian level of prosperity, tolerance and community harmony rather than their present reality of division, suspicion and poverty. Our Australian neighbours of Greek and Turkish descent have shown that it is possible for Greeks and Turks to live together. Social harmony and equality are not dreams; they can be reality. To be successful, this reality of social harmony and equity must be based on a proper policy of multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiculturalism is not multinationalism. In Australia we do not have many nations; we have one nation drawn from many peoples, and these people are proud to be Australian without having to pretend that they have come from Aberdeen, not Athens, or that they have come from Torquay, not Turkey. The communities of Cyprus can also adopt a local version of this Australian success story. Biculturalism should replace binationalism. The two communities should emphasise their Cypriotness rather than their Greek or Turkish background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This going forward to a united future is not easy, and its success will turn on individual decisions to do so. The past is very alluring because we invent the past and we make it conform with our current desires. This difficulty, which is very great, is not easily overcome, yet it can be overcome and, in Australia, it has been overcome. The Greeks and the Turks who migrated to Australia have become Australians and live peacefully here with each other. They have maintained a lot of the good things from Greece and Turkey and given these to us, and they have dropped the bad things from Greece and Turkey such as poverty, ethnic hatred and war. This process is not a result of some unique Australian genius; it is simply a result of allowing humanity, and not race or ideology, to be the arbiter of social decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, due to the success of our bipartisan and multicultural policy, supported for 20 years by both governments and oppositions over that period, we should not be shy in making suggestions to the divided communities of Cyprus. Our success in Australia can give us confidence. When we look at the future, we see that both Cyprus and Turkey are looking for membership of the European Union. The blunt truth is that while the Turkish army sits on Cyprus Turkey will be excluded from Europe. That is the long and the short of it. The diplomats will go round and round and issue communiques galore, but that is the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that Europe is worried about Islam and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. If these forces rise up in Turkey, the Europeans will become even more firmly opposed to Turkey. Greece, on the other hand, is integral to Europe. The cultural and religious dimension of Greece is fundamental to western civilisation. We cannot have this civilisation without Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution of Greece to our world and, in the past 50 years, to Australia is beyond accurate measurement. There is no part of human understanding or endeavour where the glories of Greece and her intellect have not shone. The process of thought itself would be confusion without Socrates and Aristotle. The idea of democracy would have come to nothing except that the Greeks made it work. The life of culture, the arts and writing, the whole unity of human life, was shown to be possible by the Greek states. Even in the religious life of the world, it was the Greek philosophical mind which made the Gospel understandable to the whole world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Our debt to Greeks is both cultural and pragmatic. The large number of Greeks in Australia has been an incredible stroke of good fortune for us. Our narrowness was broken by the breadth of vision. Our fear of the future is broken by their enormous confidence. Our national future is strengthened by their presence amongst us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world knows of few nations of warriors and heroes&mdash;men and women who stand and fight for what is theirs by right. Our liberty is ours by right. With Greeks in Australia, our national liberty is secure. The Greeks fought the enemies of freedom 50 years ago so that we in Australia could be part of the free world. We owe them our support and this House should give it without a quibble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these facts to outline the seriousness of the problems in the Cyprus area and also to point out how a solution to the Cyprus problem can have excellent ramifications Europe-wide. A settlement based on a unitary state on the island Cyprus&mdash;demilitarised, without Greek Cypriots longing for Greece or Turkish Cypriots longing for Turkey&mdash;could be a workable proposal. Australia can help bring this settlement about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This requires the abolition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the end of the Greek desire for enosis. If Cyprus is to be viable, the two communities must look to each other and their common island and not to their pasts across the sea. This will be difficult because it is easier to love one's own family than to learn to love the stranger. Yet, if this is not done, Cyprus will have no future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news is that it actually can be done, and in Australia it has been done. The Australian government should not ignore our successful integration of formerly warring Greeks and Turks who have now become cooperative Australians. This transformation can be effective in Cyprus with goodwill and a genuine desire for peace. Recently, the President of Cyprus was in Australia. He received a big welcome and impressed everyone who met him. I was certainly impressed by him, especially by his evident desire for a true peace between the two communities on Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am convinced that the opportunity now exists for a proper settlement of this problem on Cyprus. Recently, the Israelis and the Palestinians have begun to settle their problems. Now the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats are agreeing to settle their problems. In these circumstances, who can sensibly say that Cyprus is beyond solution? Each side of this dispute now has a very big burden to shoulder. Both sides must purge themselves from old hatreds and point scoring. They must learn to love the future, not the past. They must be motivated for the common good and not for their own factional good. This is a tall order for groups who are not normally inclined to compromise and cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge a moratorium on throwing up the grievances and the bitterness of the past. These sad events and attitudes are well known. We do not require any reminding. The two communities on Cyprus are well represented by their families living in Australia. These Australians, formerly of Cyprus, are a valuable resource for any effort at mediation by Australia. I would urge all Australians with any connections to Cyprus to be supportive of this motion and committed to a peaceful settlement based on one Cyprus nation drawn from two famous cultures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The qualities and the achievements of these two cultures are fundamental to the world that we have today. Sadly, the past is very traumatic and the wounds are still painful; yet the Christian Greeks are required by the highest authority to love those who offend them and the Moslem Turks are required by the Prophet Mohammed&mdash;peace be upon him&mdash;to live in true harmony with all their neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A return to the real cultural foundations of each community can only advance the cause of peace and just settlement. Such a return is the job of the writers and the artists of these communities. The true artist strives for the unity of all humanity and the true artist does not inflame community stresses. Australia is now seeing a rise in the number of artists from the communities. Perhaps the time is coming when we can see a single community for Cyprus drawn from those Australians from each of the two communities on Cyprus. We have no end of groups from each Cypriot community. Perhaps we can soon see a community based on the Australian principles of successful group living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to our large migration program&mdash;a program I support and will always support, because Australia will have no future without migrants&mdash;we will increasingly be involved in the affairs of foreign countries due to the large communities from these countries in Australia. This has always been the case and should not unduly worry us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should always do, when the circumstances permit, is draw on our national experience in absorbing large numbers of people from stressful areas of the world and in producing from them a nation of peaceful and cooperative Australians. We have a great deal to be proud of in relation to our migration program. Our pride is the property of all the political parties in this parliament. Equally importantly, the migrants are encouraged to learn from Australia&mdash;to learn our good ways and to help break down our bad ways. This bipartisan policy is a marvellous success, and all the greater when one sees the future of multiculturalism everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps multiculturalism is like two-up in that you have to be a real Australian to make it work properly. Whatever it is that is required, Australians have it. The successful settlement of Greeks and Turks into peaceful Australians is a testimony to the quality of Australia and the underlying quality of Greeks and Turks. They became a success in Australia; they can repeat the success on Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is an important statement by this House. All members of all communities outside this House should support it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I rise to speak on this motion, I would also like to remark that most recently you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, and I shared the platform at a very successful function in Perth, at which the travails and the oppression suffered as a result of the invasion and then partition of Cyprus were amongst the subjects of discussion. That function, where there were 350 members of the local community at the community centre in Northbridge, was a tremendous success, particularly in raising those types of issues in the consciousness of our local Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, and I have shared some views on Bosnia&mdash;another subject that has been mentioned by previous speakers in relation to this topic. I am sure that he, along with me, saw most recently the excellent series on the ABC called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The death of Yugoslavia</EMPHASIS>, in which it was quite clear that, above all else, the underlying theme behind the breakdown, the warfare and the tragic bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia was politics and power, in particular, the seeking of power to be able to exercise it over another group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at how this particular tragedy in Cyprus has unfolded, it essentially represents another use of naked power in aggression from one people against another. There is absolutely no excuse for the occupation of part of the island of Cyprus&mdash;part of the republic of Cyprus's sovereign territory&mdash;by the troops of another nation. Quite clearly, there is no excuse for the petition and the 21 years of scandal, in the sense of the lack of action on the part of the United Nations and, I might add, more recently on the part of the Commonwealth heads of government, notwithstanding their most recent statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Bosnia has been mentioned as, I suppose, a correlation with the continuing tragedy in Cyprus. It is interesting to note that, in an article that I found during the debates and matters arising from the Bosnian crisis, a Serb spokesman said, `Well, the Turks have managed to get away with this in Cyprus for 20 years. Why shouldn't we?' That particular attitude is a significant one, because it reflects the type of results that you get when the institutions that are designed to ensure world peace and to oppose aggression, occupation and military domination fail in their objectives. Bosnia was a failure, but Cyprus has been a failure for 21 years. Bosnia was a failure for almost four years, but now we are, hopefully, at the dawn of a peaceful settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cyprus still remains one of the great unresolved tragedies of Europe. Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is part of Europe. It has been culturally part of Europe since ancient times. There is no doubt, when we look at the recent history of Europe and the so-called sophistication of political developments in Europe&mdash;particularly the creation of the European Union and the greater integration of the nations of Europe within the European Union&mdash;that Cyprus is one of those remaining problems, remaining crises and remaining dilemmas that requires a solution as soon as possible in order to show that we do not and will not tolerate this type of militarist occupation. It is an illegal separation that is unrecognised and is intolerable under international law but remains in place. In other words, it is a defacto division of a sovereign nation through military aggression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting communique. This was the final communique from last month's summit in Auckland. The communique says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recalling their Cyprus Communique, Heads of Government once again expressed support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus. They urged the Security Council to take resolute action and the necessary measures for the speedy implementation of all United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, in particular Security Council Resolutions 365, 550 and 939. They expressed full support for the proposal by the President of Cyprus for the demilitarisation of Cyprus. They called for the speedy withdrawal of all Turkish forces and settlers from the Republic of Cyprus, the return of refugees to their homes in conditions of safety, restoration of and respect for the human rights of all Cypriots, and the accounting of all missing persons, and expressed grave concern at the continuing influx of settlers. Expressing deep disappointment at the continued lack of progress in achieving a solution, due to the lack of political will on the Turkish Cypriot side, they reaffirmed support for the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts to find a just and workable solution. In this context they agreed that the Commonwealth Action Group on Cyprus should continue to monitor developments and facilitate the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fine statement but, in relation to the Commonwealth, Cyprus has been one of the undying sources of discomfort because the Commonwealth has failed miserably to resolve the problems in Cyprus. In the first instance, as Cyprus was formerly a British colony, the Commonwealth had a responsibility to look at the problems in Cyprus. In particular, since 1974 the Commonwealth had a responsibility to take a far more resolute stand in opposing the occupation and separation of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent history of the island has been dominated by the division of the island since the Turkish military intervention in 1974. Since 1974 the southern part of the island has been under the territorial control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part is ruled by an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&mdash;TRNC&mdash;which is recognised only by Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both parts of the island are ruled in accordance with democratic principles affirmed through regularly held free and fair elections. But, of course, there are a number of aspects of the administration&mdash;particularly the administration of the area that is under Turkish occupation&mdash;that require resolution. The High Commissioner for Cyprus is in the gallery today. I was very moved recently to read some comments he made in a speech on a public occasion. I would like to quote some comments that he made in relation to the personal tragedy of Cyprus. These are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you wake up in the morning, for twenty one years now, and see just opposite you, your house and property being occupied by the invasion troops, when you are prevented from returning to where you were born and brought up, when every day you count the forcibly uprooted people, refugees in their own country, and find them to be one third of your country's population, when you count the missing persons and reach the number of 1619, when out of the door of your residence you hear everyday the expansionist shout of 35 thousand Turkish occupation soldiers and the noisy scream of 90 thousand Turkish illegal settlers, when your country is today the only divided country in Europe, when for twenty one years the fundamental freedoms and human rights of your people are fragrantly violated, when during all these years you have done your best and they have done their worst, then it is impossible to welcome the suggestion that you, being weak, are obliged to endorse an unacceptable situation and the invader, being strong, is entitled to continue perpetrating his crimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of sentimental reaction. It is not a matter of emotional counteraction. It is a matter of survival. It is a matter of defending your freedom and safeguarding your future. If seeking freedom and justice, if the demand for respect of human rights, if our wish and will to reunite and save our country and people, are considered by some a sentimental exercise in futile and an unrealistic approach, our people shall never accept that they don't deserve a better future, they shall never be convinced that they are a second class citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>Those poignant words reflect the human cost of a tragedy that has been present in Europe for 21 years. Sophisticated Europe in the 1990s has this divided country right in its midst; yet it has failed to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this tragedy that deserves discussion is the retardation of the economic prosperity of the island by occupation. It is clear from the statistics that if you compare the two sections of the islands&mdash;the occupied section and that which is controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus&mdash;you find there is a yawning chasm of economic development or differences between the two. At present the Republic of Cyprus is endeavouring to enter the European Union to be able to provide for its citizens a continuing increase in the standard of living and to be able to participate fully in the economic activity and the economic operations in Europe. Yet because of the occupation this process is being thwarted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic of Cyprus has an average per capita income of more than $US11,000 and has had that for more than two years. Unemployment is running at below two per cent and it has a positive growth rate. Through this economic prosperity it has made itself eligible for membership of the European Union. Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots who formerly resided in the north&mdash;one-third of the Greek Cypriot population&mdash;have flooded into the south. In the section that is under occupation, the per capita income of its citizens is less than one-third of the per capita income of those who reside in the area that is administered by the government of the Republic of Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear from the economic statistics&mdash;and these are not statistics brandished by the government as some sort of propaganda exercise; they are statistics from reputable sources&mdash;that one section is going into decline, and that is the northern section occupied by Turkish troops, and the southern section is buoyant and increasing in economic prosperity and obviously improving the standard of living of its citizens. In another sense, there is an added human rights tragedy here in that those people who reside under the occupation are being deprived of the benefits of economic prosperity and development. Apart from anything else that we can urge as Australians who value economic prosperity and the right to be able to live, work and enjoy the proceeds of a higher standard of living, this must be one of our central core objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to dwell on section 3 of the honourable member's motion, which applauds the contribution of Australian peacekeepers since 1964 in maintaining order and stability on the island. Australia has made a very significant contribution in an extraordinarily difficult situation. For 30 years Australian police have been a familiar sight in Cyprus. Prime Minister Menzies sent the first 40 Australian police to Cyprus in 1964. Former colleagues of mine in the Western Australian police force served in Cyprus. They served well the interests of their country and the interests of peace and trying to find a solution. It is interesting to note the ability of the Australian police to deal with the two sides in this equation. Many of the Greek Cypriots have relatives in Australia, so many of them have that sentimental and familiar contact with Australia. The Australian police are able to deal as fair traders with the Greek Cypriots. The Turkish people respect Australia's contribution, perhaps our bravery and our efforts at Gallipoli, and the reputation Australians have for being people of honour and courage. So both sides respect the contribution made by the Australian police contingent to Cyprus. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is a detailed motion which covers very well the complexity and the breadth and depth of the Cyprus issue. It also proposes some constructive and positive initiatives. The cultural/religious/political clash or, if you like, the boundary dispute between the Turkish and European empires has gone on now for many centuries. The movement of Turks into Europe, the invasion of Europe by Turks and by the eastern cultures, goes back many centuries. We have seen edges and points of friction that have lasted now for many years. We are watching one of those being played out and replayed in the Balkans. In that context the role of Europe in and through Cyprus dates back to the earliest invasions and also was caught up heavily in the crusades, which are very much part of British history.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the complexity of that conflict, Cyprus was a relatively minor issue. When one looks at the Middle East and the Jewish and Palestinian question and at the three-way clash in the Balkans, then Cyprus was always pushed into the background. In that context, the tragedy that developed with the Cold War meant that Cyprus became a part of yet another battle. So what had been the battle front of Islam versus Christianity, of East versus West, of the Turkish empire and the European continent became refocused to NATO versus the Eastern bloc. The importance of the Bosporus and the Black Sea became fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall being in Turkey in 1968 and meeting with some British personnel stationed in a town on the Black Sea coast who manned a radar installation whose function was to watch Russian movements across the Black Sea and into Russia.

So in a way the Bosporus and the Black Sea became fundamental to the Cold War.</PARA>

In a way, the world stood by and let Cyprus be divided and partitioned and let it be the centre for the kind of tragedy that we have seen played out over the last 21 years. In a sense it is unfortunate that, opportunistically, the major powers have allowed this to occur. It is very hard to understand how we can have resolutions about it from the UN, CHOGM and the IPU that are all virtually the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact that the so-called Republic of Northern Cyprus is recognised only by Turkey is indicative that the world does not agree with the situation there. It does not accept the Turkish forces' occupation of northern Cyprus and does not accept the settlement of Turkish citizens into Cyprus. Yet nothing seems to happen. One has to start wondering why that is. The answer becomes clear that in the international power plays that go on it was of more benefit to the West to allow Cyprus to be the centre of that kind of activity rather than to risk the withdrawal of Turkey from NATO and, hence, for the West to have no control over the Bosporus and the Black Sea, which was critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege in 1990 of representing this parliament as a sole representative at an IPU conference in Cyprus. Being in Cyprus, it was not surprising that there was some discussion about all this. The conference, amongst its other matters, decided to deal with the Mediterranean as an issue of special business. At that conference I moved an amendment to the motion that was being dealt with, an amendment along the lines of calling for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Cyprus. That amendment was debated both in committee and in the plenary session. It was interesting to watch that debate and to watch which representatives disagreed with that concept whilst their own governments were notionally supporting that principle in the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it got to the floor of the IPU the interplay was interesting to watch. Eventually the amendment was carried and the IPU adopted that resolution&mdash;over five years ago now&mdash;which called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops. Yet, five years later, we are still discussing the same issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that the world has now changed. We have seen the relegation of the Middle East question to a much lower level of intensity. We have seen in today's media the signing of some peace accord in the Balkans. We have seen the break-up of the Soviet bloc and the desire of many members of the Eastern bloc to join NATO. There is no longer the Cold War tension and the Bosporus is no longer so critical to the so-called security of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of Cyprus has remained the same. In effect, the rest of the world's problems have subsided and the Cyprus question has now become paramount. A world that cannot solve a problem like that of Cyprus is not facing up to its issues. There is no justification whatsoever for the occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish forces and there is no justification whatsoever for the settlement into Cyprus of citizens of Turkey. The Turkish Cypriots have a culture of their own. It is a Cypriot culture. The Greek Cypriots have their own culture. It is endemic and natural to them. I have no doubt that if it was not for the efforts of mainland Turkey there would not be an issue on Cyprus. I have no doubt that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are more than able to resolve their questions. In fact, we thought they had; and so did the Secretary-General of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought that resolutions were being achieved. It was therefore really quite puzzling to find that Turkey seemed not to be willing to go ahead. One starts to wonder whether the problem really is not simply one of Cyprus but rather of the internal politics of Turkey. One wonders at times who is in control of Turkey and whether the Turkish military are prepared to allow the Cypriot question to be resolved. One wonders whether the Turkish military see a resolution of the Cyprus question as being a lessening of their influence in that country and whether that may change the focus on the Kurdish issue. What the world sees as a question within Cyprus may be a much more serious question within Turkey itself and where it is going. That is quite disturbing. </PARA>

Most Turkish people whom I know do not find comfort in the Cyprus issue. They are not comfortable with it, and they do not understand why it is worth risking the wrath of the world and the alienation of all the major world forums against their country for this issue. Most of them also accept and believe, as does the Greek community, that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are more than able to resolve these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One looks at the issue and starts to ponder the significance of the Turkish military in the politics and governance of Turkey. The major powers of the world may need to start to withdraw their support for the Turkish military establishment. That may bring this issue to a head. While ever the Turkish military are part of the Western bloc and NATO and are supported by the military of the Western world, that gives them both credibility and influence. I suspect that a resolution will not be achieved until we recognise that point, start talking about it and face it. </PARA>

We are all conscious of it. It is one issue that both sides of the House strongly agree on. We need to talk more about the desecration of cultural icons and monuments in northern Cyprus. We need to talk more about the treatment of some of the property that is still owned by non-residents of that partitioned country. We need to start talking much more about the human rights and the downstream rights of successive generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was mentioned by earlier speakers, Cyprus needs to join Europe, and Europe needs Cyprus. The same is applicable to Turkey. Look at Turkey's economic development. Unless it joins Europe, Turkey is doomed to a future of low economic growth and development. The one sticking point all the way through is effectively Cyprus itself and the way that Cyprus is treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how we will persuade the Turkish military and government to accept the logic and fairness of the withdrawal of their troops. Settling mainland Turkish people into Cyprus is not in the interests of Turkish Cypriots or anybody else or even of those settlers. Given that there have been decades of agreement in the world about the issue, it is hard to envisage how we will now deal with it, unless we upscale our language and understanding of it. Perhaps we have been too gentle and kind. Perhaps we have been too sensitive to those people in Australia of Turkish origin that we wish to respect and treat as Australians. We need to particularly focus on the real architect of the issue. I am now quite convinced that it is the Turkish military. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real tragedy was that, in 1990 when I was in Cyprus moving an amendment calling for the withdrawal of Turkish troops, Australia and Turkey had celebrated the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli just a few weeks earlier. Seventy-five years after that great tragedy and those great acts of heroism by both Turkish and Australian soldiers, that incredibly unusual bond between these two countries was being torn apart by their differences over a small and innocent country that had also been torn apart. It is indicative that our parliamentarians, our military and our representatives were visiting Turkey to celebrate the 75th anniversary but at the same time were arguing about the removal of Turkish forces from Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal by the United States Congress, item 8 of the motion, `ultimate total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus', is probably the best answer. The proposals for federation may be the most practical solution, but the fact is that the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots are both politically astute and very dedicated to that island and that island nation. I have no doubt that they are more than able to find a resolution. They need the will of the world behind them to call for the effective withdrawal of all forces and to assist in the resolution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). The history of Cyprus over the last 21 years has been tragic. It has been a history of suffering and violation and its capacity to generate a further outbreak of violence has not been diminished. If such an outbreak were to occur, it would have a great potential to spread beyond the island itself and exacerbate the tensions between Greece and Turkey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of Cyprus is not just a matter of international politics; it deeply involves an important component of the Australian population. Today, there are an estimated 50,000 Australians who trace their origins to Cyprus. Australia's multicultural society embraces the second largest Cypriot community outside the Republic of Cyprus itself. Of these, 40,000 are of Greek descent and 10,000 are of Turkish descent. It is important to register that Australians of Cypriot origin of both backgrounds have worked together harmoniously in Australia and made significant contributions to Australian society. They must all feel very deeply the wounds inflicted on their country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been 21 years since the Republic of Cyprus was invaded by Turkey: 21 years since the northern third of the island was occupied by forces from Turkey displacing over 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes in the north. It is over a decade since the unilateral declaration of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the Turkish occupied zone&mdash;a so-called republic recognised only by Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion reaffirms a total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island. This is of fundamental importance. It is absolutely and utterly non-negotiable. This has been a longstanding commitment of Australia and the international community and is one which the coalition has fully supported. It cannot be resiled from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turkish invasion imposed an occupying force, but it has achieved no legal change in the status of Cyprus. There can be no recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was imposed because there was an overwhelming lack of internal and international support for the Turkish occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion reaffirms that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. This states the simple truth that we are long past an age when colonialism and international conquest was in any way acceptable by the international community. There can be no real resolution of the Cyprus issue so long as an invading force occupies Cypriot soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fundamental that Turkey withdraw the 35,000 troops from the Turkish mainland that occupy the northern zone. The troops from Turkey are occupying Cyprus against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the population and the universal opinion of the international community. An act of force does not become acceptable merely because it is protracted. The United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his report to the UN Security Council in June, described the northern zone in Cyprus as `one of the most highly militarised areas in the world'. He emphasised that in the course of this year there has been a major upgrading of Turkish tanks, anti-aircraft weapons and howitzers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military build-ups of this sort are antithetical to any genuine move for a resolution of differences. They contain within themselves the potential for an outbreak of armed conflict. They create counter-forces and arms races which exacerbate the sense of mutual distrust and antagonism. As the motion outlines, there are strong arguments for a total demilitarisation of the Republic of Cyprus. This would meet the security concerns of all the parties involved and would enhance the prospects for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the Cyprus dispute. It strikes me as being merely commonsense that, if any security guarantees are necessary, they should be supplied by international forces under the aegis of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia has made a valuable contribution to peacekeeping efforts on the island since 1964, and the motion recognises this fact. Australia has an ongoing commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Cyprus. Australians have served under difficult conditions and contributed to maintaining an uneasy peace. Their contribution does need to be emphasised and applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States and the Secretary-General have a critical role to play. Successive UN resolutions and successive secretaries-general have sought to play a significant part in resolving the Cyprus problem. The motion quite rightly recognises these longstanding efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reiterating in part some of the United Nations resolutions adopted by the Security Council. In resolution 541 of 1983, the UN Security Council deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus. It considers the declaration as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal. It calls upon all states to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. It also calls upon all states not to recognise any Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In resolution 550 of 1984, the Security Council condemns all secessionist actions, including the purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, and declares them illegal and invalid. It also calls for their immediate withdrawal. It reiterates the call upon all states not to recognise the purported state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus set up by secessionist acts and it calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In resolution 716 of 1991, the Security Council reaffirms its position on the Cyprus question that the fundamental principles of a Cyprus settlement are the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and that there be an exclusion of union in whole or in part with any other country and any form of partition or secession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition and the Australian government have consistently supported the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus. I think there is great merit in resolution 939 of July 1994, which affirmed that Cyprus must have a `single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship' with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded. It would be a state which would `exclude union in part or whole with any other country, or any form of partition'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these resolutions and despite the ongoing UN concern with Cyprus, the fact is that very little has emanated. There have been words of concern. There have been successive resolutions. There has, however, been no resolution of the issue. I would like to emphasise that the Secretary-General has criticised the Turkish government for its approach to Security Council resolution 939. The Turkish side has consistently resisted United Nations resolutions and the Secretary-General's frustration with this lack of cooperation and goodwill is transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion quite rightly `expresses deep concern that, after more than two decades of division on the island, there is still no lasting political settlement in sight, and strong belief that the status quo on Cyprus is unacceptable'. What I do find surprising coming from someone as vigorous and forthright as the member for Watson is that his usual straightforwardness and robustness&mdash;something that was forthcoming in his speech&mdash;was not actually manifest in the components of the motion itself. Perhaps the honourable member is stepping back from the past and trying to be a diplomat, but I should say that stepping out of character does not entirely suit him. In fairness to the honourable member, I should say that this was not characteristic in his speech, but the motion studiously avoids mentioning who has done what to whom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain fact that is not stated in the motion is that the onus does lie with the Turkish government. The Turkish government is the government that occupies Cyprus. The Turkish government is the government that has systematically acted in breach of United Nations resolutions. The Turkish government is the government that is building up foreign forces in Cyprus. The Turkish government is the government trying to assimilate the northern zone to the Turkish mainland and the Turkish government is the government that is denying return rights to 160,000 Greek Cypriots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is undoubtedly true, as the motion states, that there is a need for all parties involved in the Cyprus question to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve to work actively towards a lasting, peaceful political settlement. What also needs to be said, however, is that, while there are always rights and wrongs and always pre-existing tensions, irritations and triggers in every conflict, in truth and in justice, the history of Cyprus demonstrates to any reasonable person that the party on whom the overwhelming onus lies to work actively towards a lasting and peaceful political settlement and to demonstrate goodwill and a new resolve is the Turkish government. Not to recognise this is, I believe, an affront to the facts and a misplaced attempt at diplomatic politeness that threatens to defeat and undermine the purpose of the exercise. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As already canvassed, the Republic of Cyprus first achieved its independence in 1960 from Britain after four or five years of both guerilla warfare and a campaign for independence, and also substantial debate and difficulties between the communities of Turkish and Greek origin on Cyprus about a constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note some of the elements of the original constitution of Cyprus which indicate the extent to which the two communities then were able to resolve their differences in order to establish a single political entity. Both the Greek and Turkish tongues were recognised in the constitution; it was provided that there be a flag of neutral design reflecting neither Greek nor Turkish origins; both communities had the right to celebrate the various national holidays of their parent communities; specific positions were accorded to the different communities in the political structure; the public service was specified to be composed of 70 per cent Greek origin and 30 per cent Turkish origin; the army was specified to have 60 per cent Greek origin and 40 per cent Turkish origin; and even the security forces and the police had similar arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the two communities, in spite of the background of achieving independence through guerilla warfare and some conflict, were able to resolve the difficulties and establish a basis for common operation. This, in effect, only lasted some three or four years and by 1964, as a result of intercommunal conflict, the United Nations peacekeeping force was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s, as a result of the military backed coup in 1974 with EOKA, the disposing of Archbishop Makarios as the President of Cyprus and the pursuit of enosis by some forces within the Greek community, the tensions between the communities increased. The situation then unfolded, of course, whereby the Turkish invasion occurred and there was the establishment first of the federated state of Cyprus, not recognised by anybody other than the Turkish government, and then subsequently in 1983 the establishment of the self-styled Turkish Republic of North Cyprus, which occupies approximately 37 per cent of the area of Cyprus and includes within it about 180,000 people, of whom now only about 500 people are of Greek origin. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numerous resolutions have been passed by the Commonwealth, the American Congress and the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council with respect to this issue, and they have all followed a very similar theme, the same theme that is replicated in the motion moved today by the honourable member for Watson. These themes are broadly as follows: that the independence, sovereignty and territory of Cyprus as a single political entity should be recognised by the entire world, including, of course, the Turkish government; that the various United Nations Security Council resolutions with respect to Cyprus, namely No. 365 of 1974, No. 550 of 1984 and particularly No. 939 of 1994, the most recent one, should be implemented; that the island should be demilitarised; that Turkish settlers and the Turkish military forces, who number somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000, should be withdrawn; and that refugees should have the right to return to their place of origin in Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These points are of fundamental importance to the resolution of the Cyprus question, and I think all of these various bodies that I have referred to that have dealt with the issue consistently over this period of time support the basic principle that there should be a single state of Cyprus with a bicommunal, bizonal and federal structure of government which gives both communities proper participation in the affairs of the nation. It could be, perhaps, broadly similar to the original arrangement that was introduced which does give reasonable recognition to the rights of the minority Turkish population but does not give them a veto or control over the entire affairs of the island. </PARA>

In July 1994, the European Court of Justice in effect banned imports to the European Union from the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus because it did not recognise any form of health certificates that were provided other than those from the Republic of Cyprus. As a result of this, the line of the northern government, led by Mr Denktash, hardened significantly, and for a period there was an apparent rejection of the proposed bicommunal, bizonal federal solution.

I recently participated with other delegates in a trip to the European institutions and this issue was one of a number that we discussed with people in the European institutions. It is quite clear that Cyprus is well on the way to admission to the European Union.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that one of the key Greek European MPs that the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and I had discussions with indicated that in his view the Cyprus question was of greater significance to the people of Greece than the Macedonian question and that this was really a pressing question which the community in Australia and the Australian government should be aware of. Although most of the recent publicity in Australia on issues relating to the Greek community has tended to focus on Macedonia, he said that we should be wary of neglecting the importance of the Cyprus issue just because it has been a longstanding and ongoing issue. </PARA>

Australia currently has 20 Australian Federal Police personnel participating in the peacekeeping process in Cyprus. I understand that we have been there as peacekeepers since the onset of peacekeeping over 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cyprus economy is remarkably healthy in spite of these problems. In 1994, it had about five per cent growth, 4.7 per cent inflation, 2.7 per cent unemployment and a current account surplus of 1 1/2 per cent, although its budget deficit is fairly substantial. Australia's trade with Cyprus is fairly limited. We export to them about $30 million per year. This has substantially increased and consists mostly of fast ferries, which we are the world leaders in producing. Exports from Cyprus to Australia are basically minimal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The spread of those with associations with Cyprus through the Australian community has been quite remarkable. Although this motion has been moved by a city member, the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), throughout every country area of Australia&mdash;in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as in mine&mdash;there are many who have their origins in the villages of Cyprus. Although Cyprus is a long way from us, the impact of the unfortunate continued conflict between the Turkish and Greek population there has an undoubted impact here in Australia. Very strong feelings are held, and there have been some very significant rallies and demonstrations around the point of view of the two opposing sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I guess there are three things that I want to say about the general context of the situation and the reason that I support this motion. Indeed, I commend the Chief Government Whip for introducing it. The first is that it is very hard for a country like Australia so far away to resolve the differences that exist between the people of Cyprus. It is, of course, ultimately for them. We look towards the people within Cyprus being able to resolve their problems amicably, democratically and in a way that avoids conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia's commitments since 1964 of police detachments gives us a somewhat different perspective in one way from others. I think the way in which successive Australian police detachments have performed on that troubled island has been remarkable. They have come not just from the Australian Federal Police; they have come from the police forces around the Commonwealth. Having met numbers of them, both before their departure and after their return, I think Australia can be very proud both individually and collectively of the role that the police detachments have played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While Australia has this long-term commitment to peace in Cyprus, it does concern me that today there still seems to be so little progress towards final achievement. I have been one of those who has felt long since that it is probably more within the bailiwick of the European Union than anybody else that a resolution can be found; yet we saw in the outbreak of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia how inept and incompetent the Europeans were in anything that is within their own bailiwick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, the Europeans have portrayed themselves as being significant powerbrokers outside their own domain. But in the former Yugoslavia, as in Cyprus, they seem to have been not able to come to a solution. I am aware that there have been various talks and there is now some potential of an independent Cyprus becoming a member of the European Union. Were that to take place, I would be delighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, since early this year, there have been discussions with Greece and Turkey to establish an EU Turkey customs union and to make sure that, as part of that, there is a timetable for future membership of the European Union for Cyprus. The establishment of a separate community in north Cyprus, and its maintenance by virtue of the military presence of the Turks, makes it absolutely critical that both the countries on the European mainland&mdash;Greece and Turkey&mdash;come to a rational agreement on the customs union that admits Turkey, as much as they make a decision regarding Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that Cyprus has the capacity to become an independent member of the European Union. Hopefully, that may lead to an independent Cyprus without the military presence that has caused Cyprus so much anxiety and so much fear for future peace in the island. That is part of the thinking behind this motion. Paragraph 8 of the motion agrees with the United States Congress resolution calling for the total demilitarisation of Cyprus. That seems to be the way in which the Australian government should approach the subject. If the island were to be totally demilitarised it would not prejudice any separate entity that might be determined by the parties on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the people of north Cyprus wish to retain a separate state, as they have at the moment, there is no reason why they cannot do so. Essentially, that should be a matter which is determined by the people of the island. Hopefully, the rights of the minority Turkish population can be guaranteed by arrangements which avoid the presence of some sort of military deterrent. There is no doubt that if the island could be totally demilitarised the threat of significant military forces, which the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) mentioned, would be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other areas where action can follow. The European Union has the capacity to apply pressure to its members. I do not believe that the European Union can justly claim to have a responsible role in world affairs if it cannot attend to its own affairs. The divisions between various ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia should not have been insurmountable if goodwill had prevailed and if discussions, rather than fighting, had been used as a vehicle to resolve conflict. Considering the resolution of the situation in the former Yugoslavia&mdash;which seems to have emerged from intervention by the United States administration under President Clinton&mdash;one might hope that a resolution might be achieved in Cyprus between the Turkish minority and the Greek majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever has happened in the past needs to be set aside. It may be that the types of peacekeeping operations to which the United Nations is committed, with American support, within the former Yugoslavia could be applied to Cyprus. I was a member of the government when Australian police were first committed to Cyprus. It is incredible that forces have been kept there from 1964 to 1995&mdash;31 years. Our bipartisan concern has always been that we should participate in peacekeeping operations wherever they might be. I have long felt that in many instances peacekeeping operations are better carried out by police than by armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to be there forever. Australia has no long- or even short-term territorial ambitions. Our desire is to broker a peace. It seems to me that it would have been better if we had been able to train the people of Cyprus to undertake the peacekeeping role themselves. We need to consider the reasons why Australians still need to be in Cyprus after all this time. If there is no capacity to form a peacekeeping entity within Cyprus itself, perhaps the European Union or nations nearby could set up some sort of multinational peacekeeping police force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Commonwealth may have a role to play. After all, Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has just returned from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland. For all that many of us have been a little sceptical about the long-term relevance of the Commonwealth following the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa and the ending of apartheid, I am still doubtful whether, from the sorts of resolutions which I have seen coming from Auckland, the Commonwealth can really claim to be a viable and effective organisation merely on the basis of the exclusion of Nigeria from membership, on grounds which I totally endorse, and its condemnation of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. It would be far more meaningful if, as in Europe, so in the Commonwealth there could be a deliberate move within the countries which are members of the Commonwealth to ensure that one of the member countries complies with what we would see as an appropriate means to establish democratic rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason it is a pity that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting did not adopt a motion akin to that which is before this House. Had the Commonwealth reaffirmed its total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island, it might well have given the lead and perhaps the Commonwealth could have looked to ways by which from that it could have implemented other parts of this peace process towards which the motion before us is addressed. It could be that, instead of having just a United Nations police or a European police element, it might be a Commonwealth police element. After all, something similar was developed for Bougainville in order to ensure that the two warring sides there might be able to have peace talks. While I totally support the idea of maintaining Australian police in Cyprus, it seems to me that that is not a commitment that should be without some ultimate date of termination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the motion and commend the idea of resolution 939 of 1994 and the processes that the United Nations has set for resolution of the conflict. In so doing, let me say that I have always been concerned about the capacity of the United Nations to implement its decisions. So much depends on the major players, particularly the US, as to whether anything is achieved. Australia does have a capacity to get behind countries like the United States in implementing resolution 939, but the United Nations itself also has a responsibility. One would hope that the collective membership of the Security Council can adopt the resolution and proceed towards stopping the potential for continued outbreaks of fighting between the Turkish minority and the Greek majority on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remain one of those who would hope that there can be a democratic solution to the troubles of this war torn republic. The motion before the House shows the good intent of the members of the Australian community as much as the members of the Australian parliament. One would hope that from it the Australian government might be able to play an even more significant role towards implementing peace between the two sides. Cyprus is an important country in the Mediterranean. It is a country which has long had an association with Australia. It was, like Australia, originally a British territory. When it achieved independence in 1959, everyone hoped that might allow it to develop freely and democratically but, as a number of speakers have said, after the assassination of Archbishop Makarios affairs there have been extraordinarily volatile. Peace does not prevail. There are many who doubt the good intentions of Turkey at this time and it is up to others to try to broker between Turkey and Greece to ensure that Cyprus can be a truly independent nation that can achieve its own sovereignty and territorial status and that the warring parties can be put at final arm's length through the demilitarisation which paragraph 7 of the motion suggests. I commend and support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the member for Watson and Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo McLeay) for bringing forward at this stage this question of Cyprus. It is a matter which clearly has occupied the attention and the deep concern of this parliament and the Australian nation ever since Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island of Cyprus. One thing that disappoints me in connection with this debate is that on this occasion alone an element of partisan response has been introduced. I am sorry to say it was introduced by the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), who saw fit to criticise the good intentions and the good wording of that motion on the part of the member for Watson. He suggested that there should have been additional detail provided in the wording.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, those additional details were added in detail by the member for Watson in his contribution in supporting his motion. His comments were added to in further detail by the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), by the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), and by the member for Moore (Mr Filing). All those speakers preceded the member for Kooyong, who saw fit for the first time in the history of this parliament since northern Cyprus was invaded to introduce a degree of partisan comment, which I found most inappropriate and most disappointing. All of those issues were adequately canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were those issues canvassed in the debate in this chamber but they were referred to quite specifically in United Nations Security Council resolution 939, which is referred to again quite specifically in the motion of the member for Watson. They were also canvassed more than adequately in the declaration of the recent meeting of CHOGM. I prevail on all members of this chamber, of the Senate and of the wider community who from time to time might give their attention to this question to maintain an honest, genuine and deliberately bipartisan attitude towards it. In that way we will be able to make progress in developing the concern, the conscience and the attitude of the Australian people and avoid at that level the tragic division which has taken place in that magnificent island in the Mediterranean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote some of the wording of the United Nations resolution to which the member for Watson refers in his motion, then I want to refer to some other resolutions by the United Nations Security Council on this very same matter. Let me first quote from Security Council resolution 939 of 1994. It says that the Security Council, on behalf of the world community:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">reiterates that the maintenance of the status quo&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in Cyprus&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is unacceptable;</PARA>
<PARA>We endorse that absolutely&mdash;it is completely unacceptable. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reaffirms its position that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality and a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal communities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as part of that more recent quite fruitful consideration which has been given to this question&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as described in the relevant Security Council resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that such a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 6 of that resolution says that the Security Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decides to remain actively seized of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That was decided at the United Nations Security Council meeting on 29 July 1994. Let me read from another Security Council resolution. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Condemns all secessionist actions, including the purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, declares them illegal and invalid and calls for their immediate withdrawal;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reiterates the call upon all States not to recognize the purported State of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" set up by secessionist acts and calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Calls upon all States to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus;</PARA>
<PARA>Further in that resolution, it decided `to remain seized'. I am glad that the Security Council decided that in 1984. I have just been quoting from resolution 550 of 1984 that the Security Council decided `to remain seized of the situation'. In 1994 the Security Council decided `to remain actively seized of the matter'. That is a little more positive. I could go back&mdash;and will, briefly&mdash;to 1983, to Security Council resolution 541 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA>We can go back to Security Council resolution 365 of 1974, 21 years ago, and we can go back to Security Council resolution 367 of 1975. It is important for people like Bob Brown and others in the world community to have confidence and faith in the capacity of the United Nations to do what it alleges it is seeking to do. We have been waiting for 21 years for the United Nations to do something about this deplorable partition in Cyprus, to prevail upon 50 million Turks occupying that proud nation of Turkey to abide by the urgings of the international community and withdraw from Northern Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that I am quickly losing faith in the United Nations, in its capacity to achieve those objectives which it sets for itself? The United Nations is a recognised international body representing the whole of the world community which continues to make declarations of that kind and, after 21 years, repeats the same expression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in 1960 that Cyprus became an independent republic. Its sovereignty and territorial integrity were guaranteed by a treaty that was signed by Britain, Turkey and Greece. In 1974, Northern Cyprus was invaded by Turkey. I know there was a lot of confusion, uncertainty, ambiguity and controversy about the circumstances that immediately preceded that invasion. I think that is of little concern today. The concern today should be to bring about an equitable, sensible, long-lasting and honourable solution to that terrible, tragic, continuing partition of an island one-seventh the size of Tasmania, with its top northern third separated off. Everyone of good will would seek to see an honourable solution to that situation and to those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to Cyprus occurred in 1984. That was the 10th anniversary of the invasion. My first notice of motion in this parliament followed in October 1984. No-one visiting Cyprus could help but be affected by the magnificence of that little island&mdash;its history, tradition, culture and magnificent diversity. It has a history which, unlike 200 years of European history in Australia, goes back thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean, `Mediterranean' meaning the middle of the world. Cyprus was on the crossroads of the ancient world. It was subjected over the centuries to successive invasions and occupations. One would hope that the people of Cyprus&mdash;the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots&mdash;in today's contemporary world would have been able to find a sensible and honourable accommodation one with the other so that that little jewel in the Mediterranean could be looked on by the people of the world as one island, one people and one nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of whether it is a federated settlement or not, there is obviously a need for the demilitarisation of northern Cyprus and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops who occupy northern Cyprus. Those Cypriots who have been forced to leave their homes and who have had their property expropriated from them should be able to return in peace and with goodwill occupy their properties and live alongside those Turkish neighbours with whom they lived prior to 1974. There is a need for all of those things to be given consideration and for those questions to be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goals, about which I will have more to say, that were established, that were set, that were stated at Bogor are of enormous importance to the future of the Asia-Pacific world, and of course that is where Australia finds itself and where Australia will continue to be. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor goals were unprecedented and audacious. The challenge for APEC this year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, this year at Osaka&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was to put in place at Osaka a plan of action which would show how the goals could be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the result in Osaka was an outstanding success.</PARA>
<PARA>So do I. I thought the Bogor declaration in the first place and the establishment of APEC heralded a new approach on the part of the 18 member countries, including Australia, from the Asia-Pacific area which we had not seen before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has also made the observation from time to time that prior to APEC there was no single forum where all those heads of government and heads of state could meet together. He has made the observation that, as a result of the APEC forum, they now know one another personally&mdash;they sit together, they talk together, they dine together, they laugh together, they address the same problems together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before APEC, there was no such forum. There were other regional forums. There were other regional opportunities. There were other multinational arrangements of various kinds. There were continuing bilateral arrangements of various kinds and bilateral negotiations around particular issues. But there was no single body with the dimension and the potential of APEC before that Bogor declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is important because it has now provided a framework which will ensure our continuing and deeper integration into the dynamic region around us with all of the economic, political and strategic benefits which follow from that. It is of deep and long-term significance to Australia. In this context that is the important point. There are some people who have looked at the short-term objectives and have suggested with some legitimacy&mdash;and I do not want to diminish the genuineness and validity of their concerns&mdash;that the short-term objectives appear perhaps to be less than we would have preferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real value of APEC, the Bogor declaration and the continuing negotiations such as that just completed at Osaka are the long-term benefits. Those 18 APEC economies already account for 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half the world's trade. Sixty per cent of the world's GDP and half the world's trade is accounted for within the 18 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, of which Australia is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention Australia's participation in this whole process and the encouragement which Australia has given throughout the process. There have been many occasions when the Prime Minister personally and senior ministers in this government in their own areas of responsibility have taken the opportunity of bringing together many of the heads of state and heads of government in those countries. There has been a significant innovating force directed from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of population, Australia is a relatively small member country of APEC. In terms of integrity, in terms of a moral presence and in terms of the respect afforded any of those member countries, Australia stands tall. It is great to think that Australia does have an opportunity to make the significant contribution that it has been making. In his ministerial statement yesterday, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaders did not only talk about principles and process at Osaka. They also delivered a package of initial actions&mdash;a `downpayment' on their Uruguay Round commitments&mdash;which demonstrates beyond question APEC's seriousness of purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Prime Minister. I am also conscious of some of the reservations which have been expressed by well-informed commentators about some of these shorter term objectives. When you look at an initiative of the kind that APEC represents, you need to examine even more closely the long-term implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the leaders did at Osaka was to agree to draw up timetables for scrapping trade barriers ahead of next year's leaders summit in Manila. They also renewed the pledge that they made initially at Bogor in Indonesia last year that developed economies would dismantle all trade barriers by the year 2010. The 18 countries of the world which belong to the Asia-Pacific region, which produce 60 per cent of the world's wealth and which conduct 50 per cent of the world's trade, made a solemn declaration to abolish by the year 2010 all restrictions on trade. That was a historic decision if ever there was one. They said that the developing countries would reach that same objective one decade later&mdash;in 2020. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariff cuts and the dismantling of informal trade barriers across all of those APEC economies are expected to add $25,000 million&mdash;$25 billion&mdash;directly to Australia's GDP. In addition to that, the increased trade cooperation, the cuts to red tape, the opening up of all of those processes and to freeing of those trading relationships between those 18 member countries of APEC will add to the Australian community, to the Australian economy, to the pockets of Australians, to the investment decisions of Australian business and to the dining tables of Australian families another $15,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, the benefits to Australia can be, and almost certainly will be, in today's dollar terms, $40,000 million every year&mdash;not once off but every year, continuing. So there is our long-term investment, our long-term willingness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are a lot of reservations about the extent to which, the way in which and the speed with which Australia has been dismantling its trade barriers. This country depends on trade. We live by trade. We must trade, and we cannot trade with countries that put up trade barriers against Australia. Our products have to be able to penetrate into those economies. With what credibility can Australia appeal to the countries of the world who buy our products to reduce or to eliminate their trade barriers if we maintain ours?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it difficult sometimes in my own community to discuss this issue. People say, `We have to go back to the 1960s. We have to go back to protection. We have to go back to the tariff wall. We have to go back to that economic fortress Australia. We can be self-dependent. We can be economically independent.' Let me say quite clearly: we cannot be. What we have to do is to recognise the world reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninety-five years ago, this continent went through the experience of abolishing trade barriers between what were then the equivalent of six different countries.

Those people on the opposition side who purport to be the economic managers, for all of the time and times they were in government before 1983, did none of that. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Trade liberalisation is surging ahead, but domestic reform has hit a brick wall and the Federal Government must act quickly if Australia is to remain competitive", the President of the NFF, Mr Donald McGauchie, said today.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. I also have in my hand a book, which I commend to members of the House and elsewhere, from the Australian Council for Overseas Aid written by Geoff Atkinson, which summarises APEC as winners and losers, as they see it, and ends up with some recommendations, but points out, quite reasonably, that there are knock-on effects of trade liberalisation, particularly with subsistence farming and the like, and that these are matters which cannot be ignored as we work through the onward momentum and the advantages overall of trade liberalisation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the initiatives outlined in the action agenda agreed to in Osaka. The agenda provides a blueprint for the future of APEC. I believe that if APEC is to be the pacemaker in global trade liberalisation, and indeed it is emerging as such, then it is important that the region's economies commit themselves to principles of comprehensiveness, world trade organisation consistency, comparability, non-discrimination, transparency, flexibility and cooperation. It is equally important that the region's liberalisation agenda be accompanied by a timetable to achieve the long-term goal of open trade and investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have visited many of APEC's attributes in the past, and we recognise that it is a need of this parliament to get the right balance with regard to assessing APEC, the future of APEC, the achievements thus far with APEC, and what the practical outcomes will be flowing from APEC. I know my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) has studied in detail aspects of this and will have more to say about this and the way that some of the outcomes of APEC have been presented one way at the international level, quite differently in Singapore and quite differently in Japan. I welcome his presence here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I welcome the range of trade and investment facilitation initiatives&mdash;initiatives that will result in benefits flowing through to the business community. The removal of non-tariff barriers is particularly welcomed because I would argue that, while tariff reduction is a more explicit process, often tariff reductions are replaced by a more subtle form of market impediments well-known to members on both sides of the House. If we can arrive at undertakings that would see the abolition of those forms of barriers to trade, the region will benefit enormously by such streamlining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a similar observation in regard to standards and conformance. As the Prime Minister has said, the harmonisation of customs procedures will also be of considerable benefit to Australian business. While I share the Prime Minister's hopes for APEC in the future, from a regional perspective there are, I suggest, several outstanding issues which should not be forgotten, which should be placed in perspective at the outcome of the Osaka summit. Those issues will continue to challenge its development, and I think that process does temper the Prime Minister's optimism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the vexed question of agriculture was resolved, and Japan's leadership remained intact and so on, I am concerned about the fragility of the very foundations of the APEC forum, especially in the context of disputation and working through disputation problems. The point I want to make is that, it seems to me, if there is to be substantive cooperation among Asia-Pacific governments as they move towards the ambitious target set at Bogor&mdash;2010, 2020&mdash;and ratified at Osaka, there will need to be a high degree of mutual respect and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said, when we look back over the record of regional disputation, that that sense of trust does not yet fully exist. Progress has been made, but we are not by any means in the end game. To create the conditions in which serious practical cooperation on facilitating or liberalising trade and investment can be expected, all Asia-Pacific governments in my view will need to work together on at least two urgent issues: to create confidence about the capacity and willingness to accommodate China&mdash;obviously a very large player in the first half of the next century and obviously a very large player already today&mdash;in the world economy; and to change the way disputes about trade policies are dealt with by Asia-Pacific governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is undeniable that the frequency and severity of disputes about trade policy, and the practicalities of trade policy between the US and its major East Asian trading partners, have increased in recent years. There appears to be a growing tendency for the US to link trade policy with issues including labour rights, environmental policy and political matters such as the definition of human rights. Moreover, the USA seems to prefer to seek reform of trade policies it perceives to be unfair by threats of retaliation under section 301 of its own legislation, rather than using the dispute resolution mechanisms available elsewhere, most notably with the WTO. These tendencies, and the disputes arising from them, create uncertainty and, as emphasised strongly in the 1995 report of the APEC Eminent Persons Group, they are making it very difficult to achieve the degree of cooperation which will be needed for the APEC process to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While goals, and indeed the achievements of APEC since it has come into being, are to be recognised, they count for little if their efforts are undermined by disputation driven by domestic political agendas. The inclusion and the endorsement given to dispute mediation I would propose is critical to the long-term stability of APEC. It is a matter that requires considerably more attention to establish very clearly the proper processes on dispute mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I suggest that for the Philippines meeting in 1996&mdash;the next APEC summit, already scheduled for Subic in the last quarter of 1996&mdash;it would be useful to place on the agenda a proposal for an APEC code of practice for the settlement of trade policy disputes that will have, as its core, a sequence of provisions that would produce an orderly way of resolving trade policy disputes&mdash;and far more orderly than recent outbreaks in the course of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has spoken in his statement of the advantages that Osaka will open up to Australian business. In a systemic context, perhaps he is technically correct. All the actions contained in the action plan are capable of delivering, potentially, major opportunities to business across the whole spectrum. I acknowledge the contribution that has been made by all of the leaders participating in the APEC process to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, realistically, I think that the Prime Minister is misleading us, because no matter what initiatives are put in place in the APEC context and no matter what bold actions are taken by APEC economies, if they do not put runs on the board then we really need to ask what benefits will accrue to Australian enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally take exception to the Prime Minister's assertion that there was a real win for Australian farmers in the Osaka outcomes. There was a potential win for Australian farmers. I welcome the efforts made and some of the advisings given in this regard, but all of that has to be matched with micro-economic reform and further progress right here in Australia. All of that has to be matched with removal of the taxation structure impediments and other factors which militate against Australia being able to cut the mustard competitively at the international level and compete effectively across the wide spectrum of goods. I do not mean just primary industry goods but the many services which Australia today exports. Other manufactured goods, including Australian whitegoods, have a very tight situation to face with their export efforts and have a series of tariff concession applications raining in on them, which are administered in a hostile way too often by the Canberra bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these things militate against the fundamental strength and momentum of the exports of whitegoods from the likes of Email in Orange, in the electorate of Calare, to Asian nations. Nevertheless, against those odds, millions of dollars of Australian whitegoods are being exported to Asia, to the world, and making the grade, but they are doing so in very tough circumstances and with a very fine margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless this country gets fair dinkum about completing the processes of micro-economic reform, we will not succeed in gaining the full potential that can flow from the diversity of export effort now available&mdash;right through to the ostrich industry, which met very constructively here in Canberra this week. There is the alpaca industry at one end of the diverse spectrum, and at the other is the export of high-tech ferries from Hobart to Holland and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that matter, let me add that the corporate tax rate is definitely relevant. The most recent increase in the corporate tax rate has once again closed up the gap in our competitiveness with so many of the key Asian countries with which we have to deal. They, too, have put a down payment in. You must acknowledge the down payment that China, in particular, and Korea have made as part of the APEC process, with their hundreds of items of tariff reductions tabled as part of the Osaka summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Singapore has a tariff-free spectrum, but I remind the House that Singapore also has a categorisation and classification system of assessment of, for example, those same whitegoods. For instance, if Email seeks to change the colour of a washing machine it is exporting from Orange through to Singapore, it has to go through a whole classification process and inspection process with regard to the motor in that washing machine and every other aspect&mdash;even the electrical system&mdash;just for the sake of a change of colour of a particular product. These are non-tariff barriers which I hope the spirit of APEC will now strip away to allow the fulfilment of the trade potential that exists between Australia and Asia and between Australia/Asia and Pacific countries. </PARA>

He is a former chairperson of the caucus economics committee; he does understand international trade better than do most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are a number of important issues that we should consider about the APEC meeting last week. Let us just review a little of the history of APEC, because I can assure you that we on this side of the House are extremely proud of the fact that APEC essentially is an Australian initiative&mdash;it is an Australian government initiative. APEC was inaugurated in January 1989 at the initiative of the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the first meeting of 12 economies was held in Canberra in November 1989. In 1991 at APEC's third meeting in Seoul, the Republic of Korea was able to negotiate the entry of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; in 1993 Mexico and Papua New Guinea joined; and at the Seattle meeting in 1993 Chile was accepted, joining in November 1994 and bringing the membership to its present level of 18 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about these 18 countries is that in the APEC region we have a population of some 2.2 billion people and a total GDP of $US14 1/2 trillion, or almost half of the world output. Australia has the good fortune to be a part of that organisation&mdash;not only part of it but also I think we can say quite fairly that we helped to make it succeed; we helped to bring it together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Before I go on, I would just like to point out that there is no doubt that the participation of the Japanese government, of the Japanese Prime Minister, was important and the initiatives that they took. I think it was fairly significantly recognised by the Prime Minister because I note that in his speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This meeting was a very great success for Prime Minister Murayama and the Japanese government, especially MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono who were most directly involved. Japan's leadership was very important in helping to shape this outstanding result, and I . . . congratulate them on it.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure what the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) really wants in a statement. But, personally, I think that that does indicate the part that the Japanese people played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC's share of world trade has risen from 36.2 per cent in 1980 to over 45 per cent in 1994. This is largely as a result of East Asia's strong export performance. In the five years to 1994, APEC exports grew at a trend rate of 9.6 per cent annually, and that compares with total world exports which have increased at an annual rate of five per cent. As I said previously, we are indeed fortunate that we are aligned, that we are a driving force, and that we are an industrial nation belonging to what is going to become the largest trade bloc in the world economy. As an initiator, of course, we stand to receive significant benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Osaka was the meeting that had the principal objective of developing concrete proposals to achieve free trade, and it has done that. In the lead-up to the meeting many fears were raised that some countries&mdash;principally Japan and China&mdash;would not be able to support the proposals mainly because of traditional trading patterns, particularly with their rural economies. Fortunately, commitment won through and Osaka will go down in history as an outstanding success: as the starting point; as the place where the foundation was laid for the 21st century of trade which will revolutionise the Asia-Pacific region of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of APEC ensures that the 21st century will commence on a basis of cooperation and promise for all participating nations. The growth of these regions will ensure the expansion of markets, particularly for Australia's rural sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APEC conference in Osaka also saw some major changes to the level of tariff reductions by the large economic powers. As a nation we have traditionally hidden behind tariffs. We have encouraged growth of our industry because of tariffs. I know that in my own electorate we have one of the largest fabric manufacturers in Australia. I refer to National Textiles which employs over 500 people. That company enjoys significant tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, these are some of the problems that we will have to face up to as tariffs are withdrawn. Tariff protection in other countries for the things that we can produce&mdash;and which we are extremely competitive at producing&mdash;can be a downside. However, the expansion of those markets will more than compensate for the loss of some of the local markets that we enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has committed itself to accelerating its reduction in tariffs beyond the Uruguay level of reductions by years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China has also showed its commitment to APEC by announcing that it would substantially reduce tariffs on over 4,000 goods and eliminate import control measures on 170 tariff lines, resulting in a reduction of no less than 30 per cent.

One of the major problems that Australian exporters have with countries such as Japan is the distribution of the goods once we get them there. Many potential exporters have told me of the problems they have in getting someone who is prepared to sell their goods. If it is not a Japanese importer who buys in Australia and then distributes, then most likely the Australian product will not be sold.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian beef is a classic example. As a beef producer, I am concerned that beef producers do not get a fair return for their product. When you go to Japan, you see that a product which may be selling for $7 or $8 a kilogram in Australia is selling for many times that amount in Japan. Yet the Australian producer is finding it extremely difficult to make a profit in producing that commodity. The profit is not being made by Australian companies; it is being made by the vertically integrated Japanese companies, which are engaged in growing, slaughtering, packaging and transporting, and in selling machinery. Australians have to accept the challenge. They have to say, `The market is there. It is not going to come to us. We have to go to it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the APEC summit has spelt out for Australia is increased jobs and income for the next 20 to 30 years. Analysts expect that the APEC summit will produce a $40 billion boost to the Australian economy, creating over 500,000 new jobs in the next two decades. Trade liberalisation will contribute $25 billion; the cutting of red tape, through the cooperation that is engendered in the APEC agreement, will provide another $15 billion saving for Australians. Real income is expected to increase by 6.8 per cent, due to regional free trade by the year 2020. In the APEC region the flow-on effects from the previous Bogor conference will see the income of APEC members increase by 3.8 per cent, or about $US745 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These forecasts have not taken into account the full effect of the developing nations in the region. China's demand for grain is growing so fast that its estimated shortage within 15 years could be three to six times Australia's current annual wheat production. As a close neighbour with a strong, secure agricultural sector, Australia is ideally placed to benefit from China's food requirements, and from a general shortage in food production in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the National Farmers Federation, Don McGauchie, has said that farmers stand to generate another $2.9 billion a year from more liberalised trade as a result of the APEC agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all previous speakers in the chamber have indicated, both sides of politics strongly support the APEC arrangements. Members opposite seem to have put a gloss on what has been achieved in reality. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), who spoke a moment ago, has perhaps hit the nail on the head when he said that APEC offers great potential for Australia and we certainly hope that that potential comes to fruition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of obstacles in the path of that fruition, and we hope those obstacles are progressively overcome so that the wonderful goals of APEC will be achieved and the many benefits that we all would like to see happen do occur so that the Australian economy and community are benefited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was said yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the coalition welcomes the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to APEC. The coalition is totally in agreement with the objectives of APEC and certainly the objectives of the government in relation to trade liberalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been over many years a period of dialogue. Many countries have had individual problems with some of the goals of APEC, and those discussions have resulted in bold declarations. We had Bogor last year and more recently we had Osaka. Unfortunately, as yet, we have not seen anything tangible to benefit the Australian economy from APEC. We continue to be offered more hope, and we welcome that hope, but we look forward to achievements of substance and positive tangible benefits to reward Australia and other countries participating in the APEC process for the taxpayers' dollars that have been spent on APEC to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement of goals and objectives of the leaders of APEC is welcomed warmly by the coalition, but I must say that I have concerns that what happens is that leaders gather, they make bold declarations and they go away feeling warm and fuzzy. The proof of their success, however, will be in what is ultimately achieved by the end dates of 2010 and 2020. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have noted concerns by Australian exporters that other countries have not been as open as we have in relation to trade liberalisation and I hope that those matters are addressed. It has been said that freer trade has been one-sided and that some Australian producers, particularly primary producers, have been disadvantaged. It is not contested by anyone that the Asia-Pacific region is indeed the fastest growing, the most dynamic, part of the world and we are fortunate to be geographically situated in this region. It ought to be noted, though, that the fact we are situated in the region does not automatically entitle us to the benefits that should flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was indicated by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fisher), we have to participate in the process of micro-economic reform; it is obvious that the government has been dragging the chain in relation to micro-economic reform. Although we are geographically located in the Asia-Pacific region, this of itself will not be sufficient to make sure that we participate in the benefits of the APEC process. We have to perform domestically, we have to become more competitive, and I think decisions made by the government in recent times have indicated that the government's commitment to micro-economic reform has flagged substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of concern that, while the proportion of world trade in the APEC area continues to grow, Australia's share of East Asian exports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years. These points were highlighted only yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. We are not proud of these facts. They are a tragedy. Since 1983, Australia has lost market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our merchandise trade surplus with the APEC region has actually declined, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I can see that you looked shocked at this&mdash;from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. That is a reduction of $4 billion in four years, and one would hope that the government is going to look seriously at that major problem because we ought to be encouraging the growth of our trade into this region. The fact that our trade surplus has been cut back so dramatically, particularly at a time when we have such an ongoing trade deficit, is something that the government must look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, I was privileged to visit Singapore as part of a parliamentary delegation, and I was impressed to see that Australia had a very large proportion of dairy products being sold through supermarkets in Singapore. I am told that some 60 per cent of dairy products sold in Singapore comes from Australia but, of course, there should be more. When one looks through stores in Singapore, particularly supermarkets, one finds that we are not the food basket for Asia to the extent that we should be. Collectively, we as a community must do more to trade into this area. I know the government would certainly like to see our trade exports increase into East Asia, but the result has been that, over four years, our surplus has dropped by some $4 billion. Instead of going in the right direction, we are going in entirely the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent part of the South Burnett, an area which is getting a new wine industry under way at the moment, and I would like to commend the wine growers and the wineries which are being established at this time. But it is a matter of concern, when looking at wine consumption in East Asia, that French product seems to be sold much more often than the Australian product does. We need to get into that market and do better than we have indeed been doing until the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor declaration was an important milestone. At that time, the APEC economies committed themselves to the goal of free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific by 2010&mdash;at the latest&mdash;by industrialised countries, and by 2020 by developing countries. Of course, we support this, 100 per cent. It is an ambitious aim. A lot of people talked about the Osaka summit this year and how certain countries wanted to opt out in relation to various areas, including agriculture, but I am pleased that an agreement was reached at Osaka to say, in effect, that there would be no backsliding and that the end dates of 2010 and 2020 would remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, of course, support those end dates, but I hope that what was said at Osaka was not merely a form of words. The proof will be in the pudding. At present, there are not sufficient guarantees to ensure that countries, in fact, meet these deadlines or, indeed, that appropriate progress is being made. Certainly, plans have to be brought forward over the next couple of years, and I hope that those plans will be real and genuine. We seem to find that on many occasions these meetings are talkfests. Forms of words are found which are ambitious and which would, if implemented, certainly be wonderful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proof will indeed be, as we approach the years 2010 and 2020, whether those bold declarations can be brought to fruition and to reality. The APEC economies are very important to the world. For instance, the 18 APEC economies have some 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half of its trade. Australia is, as other speakers have said, fortunate to be in this geographic region and part of APEC. If the declarations which have been made are implemented, obviously we will benefit substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that we will benefit to the extent of some $40 billion each year in extra income and the government has also claimed that an extra 500,000 jobs will be created. Everyone here would welcome the extra $40 billion of new income to Australia and 500,000 new jobs. These are government estimates and I have no reason to disbelieve them. But what we must appreciate is that we will not see the $40 billion in extra income and the 500,000 new jobs unless those end target dates, of 2010 and 2020, are met. The trade liberalisation should contribute some $25 billion and the cutting of red tape will contribute a further $15 billion. Those two figures add up to the $40 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition welcomes these benefits. We think they are absolutely vital. If we are elected to government at the next election&mdash;and we will be&mdash;we will work towards these end targets of 2010 and 2020 because this issue of trade liberalisation is too important for it to be a partisan issue. It is not a partisan issue. The Prime Minister spoke in this place yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition welcomed the Prime Minister's statement, and everyone in this place is committed to the principles agreed on at Bogor and those at Osaka. But what we want is to see firm and strong progress towards the achievement of those principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eight principles which have been enunciated include WTO consistency, comparability, non-discrimination, transparency, standardisation, commitment to move together in the liberalisation process, and comprehensive coverage of all sectors and issues. Like the Prime Minister, I was particularly pleased that the agricultural sector was not excluded. There had been suggestions that agriculture was to have been cut out of this process. Fortunately, the government and other governments agreed that there ought to be no backsliding in this area&mdash;or, indeed, in any other area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have is this bold declaration by countries throughout the world of a statement of principles that everyone here supports. Yet the problem is that, until now, we have not seen any tangible benefits of APEC. We hope that those benefits will flow through to the Australian economy. It is interesting to note that Australia has been one of the most gung-ho countries talking about removing trade barriers. Yet, during this process, it unilaterally reneged on an open skies agreement with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that whatever the Bogor commitment, whatever has been decided in Osaka, each country in APEC will have a continuing obligation to meet those deadlines and objectives. It is important that individual countries do not play their hands as they see fit. It is important that countries come forward next year with appropriate plans on how they are going to move towards the end dates of 2010 and 2020 because this trade liberalisation, if it happens, is of enormous benefit to Australia. We hope it happens, and it is important that everyone work towards its fulfilment and its achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the declaration at Osaka, while certainly welcome, did not go as far as it should have. In fact, the government itself would have liked to have seen it go further. For instance, the Commonwealth wanted some quantitative measures and milestones to keep countries honest in delivering on their pledge, and a firm agreement ruling out any rises in protection. Other countries wanted more to be included in the final declaration, but those other countries were not successful either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States, for instance, wanted a specific timetable for full implementation by 2010 and 2020. Others suggested that each country bring forward its trade openings under the Uruguay Round, that the non-binding investment code become binding, and so on. But all of those matters were not included in the final declaration, so what we have is a very fine form of words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a wonderful sense of progress last year at Bogor. We support what was achieved there. We applaud the contribution made not only by this Prime Minister but also by other leaders. We applaud the contribution made by earlier Australian prime ministers, because this aim of global trade liberalisation has been one of those great bipartisan issues in Australian politics. We appreciate what was done at Bogor. We compliment the participants at Osaka. But what we want to see is movement towards the achievement of those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having found a form of words, I hope that we will not find, some time down the track, that the participants will be allowed to renege. So the government, until the election, and then the coalition in government after the election will have to watch very closely to make sure that we do indeed build some more accountability into this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many countries, of course, could take the view that 2010 and 2020 are a long way away and therefore it is okay to sign, as it is important to be seen as being a good international citizen. But we need to make sure that those end dates of 2010 and 2020 are met. We have to ensure that there is clearly defined progress towards the achievement of those end dates, because it would be a tragedy, not only for Australia, not only for Australian producers, not only for the Australian community but indeed for the entire world community, if the achievements which have been trumpeted at Bogor and Osaka are not in fact brought to fruition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By any measure or understanding of Australia's best interests, APEC and the Osaka action agenda are irresistibly logical and irresistibly good. A small trading nation like Australia will not find an economy of scale on its domestic market of 17 million people sufficient to sustain all industries in all parts of the economy. Nor will such a small market ever produce sufficient private sector competition&mdash;the competition, continuous upgrading and innovation needed for a prosperous domestic economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's solution, Australia's future, is reflected in the APEC agenda: to continue to open our markets to international competition as the catalyst for dynamic industry upgrading; and to seek success and penetration on global markets, finding competitive advantages and an economy of scale beyond the limits of our small domestic market. This is, of course, the model and the formula for success that has been developed by small trading nations around the world since World War II, most notably Italy, Sweden and Switzerland in Europe and in Asia the Asian tigers, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important in this debate to acknowledge that Australia's development and emergence as a world competitor, according to this model for small trading nations, was delayed and retarded by successive coalition governments after World War II. It was delayed and retarded by Menzies, McEwen and Fraser with the crude, failed, isolationist policies of coalition government through the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s; the crude, failed, protectionist policies of those opposite who really have not reformed themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amazed in this debate to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other coalition speakers saying that they fully support the APEC principles of free trade in the region. This is bunkum; this is hypocrisy. It is not in their hearts, it is not in their heads and it is not in their public comments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the reference and information of the member for Mackellar, it is certainly not in their discussion in the party room. I noted a very interesting piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>newspaper, subsequently confirmed, from 6 November. An unnamed National Party member&mdash;I trust it was not you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile&mdash;referred to the Leader of the National Party, the shadow minister for trade, and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't know whether it's lack of intellectual capacity or lack of intestinal fortitude or both.</PARA>
<PARA>I know there are some slow learners in the National Party, none more so than its leader, but we on this side of the House have known the answer to that question for a long, long time. It is both. When it comes to the Leader of the National Party, it is a lack of intellectual capacity and a lack of intestinal fortitude. He is both dumb and dumber, and weak and weaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, the report goes on to talk about National Party debates about trade policy, and this is the majority opinion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They believe that the farm debt crisis and the absence of an international economic level playing field have rendered rationalism lethal to the rural economy. Fischer's enemies are anti-Hilmer, anti-competition policy and anti-level playing field. They are <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">for</EMPHASIS> protection, cross-subsidies and statutory marketing. Their mantra consists of two names: Black Jack McEwen and Doug Anthony.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Party majority cites the Brazilian coffee cartel as the way for Australia to be operating on the international market. This exposes the hypocrisy and the double standard, for National and Liberal Party members to come into this place and say, `We are all for APEC; we are all for these free trade benefits,' but in their party room to be debating the model of the Brazilian coffee cartel for Australia. It is an outrage, an absolute outrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have not reformed themselves. The same outfit that ran the protectionist and isolationist trade policies in the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s would do it again in the 1990s. What model would they use? They would not use APEC, regional free trade, the benefits of the Uruguay Round or the benefits of GATT. They would use the model of the Brazilian coffee cartel with all its worst features of collusion, subsidies and protectionism, rolled into the trade policies of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would it mean for Australia's future, if, after the next election, there was a change of government and Tim Fischer, of all people, was nominated Australia's new trade minister? He would go to the next meeting of APEC. After they had called the security guards to check his credentials&mdash;not believing that someone of his low level capacity could be a participant at APEC&mdash;what would happen? He would have to announce himself and say, `Hi; I am Tim Fischer, the new trade minister for Australia. The majority of my party back home adopt the Brazilian coffee cartel as their model for trade.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets worse. Judge not the National Party in isolation; look at the policies of the Liberal Party. The shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> from 3 July saying that he was calling for a fundamental shift in Australian tariff policy. The magazine reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He has signalled a dramatic change in the coalition's approach to industry. Mr Moore has raised the prospect of slowing tariff reductions. He has called for a move away from reliance on multilateral trade agreements towards direct negotiation on market access with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA>It is remarkable that the shadow minister for industry would be wanting to move away from multilateral forums like APEC and its agenda and go back to the McEwenite model of bilateral trade negotiations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He wants to go back to the 1950s and 1960s. He wants to forget about the multilateral benefits of forums like APEC and the GATT and go back to bilateral arrangements. There is a harmony in the views of the Liberal and National parties on trade. They do not want free trade or multilateral trade negotiations. Their model is the Brazilian coffee cartel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a change of government, the new minister for industry, the honourable member for Ryan, would front up at APEC, a multilateral forum, and tell them that the Howard government in Australia wants to downgrade these sorts of things. It wants to get out of multilateral arrangements and go back to the failed policies of protectionism and isolationism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no support for APEC from honourable members opposite. It is not reflected in their policies. All the empty rhetoric and the assurances they have provided in the House in this debate count for absolutely nothing. The thing that counts is their policy, and the policy of the National Party is modelled on the Brazilian coffee cartel. The policy of the Liberal Party, reflected in the public comments of its shadow minister for industry, the honourable member for Ryan, is to downgrade multilateral trade agreements and slow the pace of Australia's tariff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as we slow our pace, our trading partners slow their pace. Effectively, the National and the Liberal parties want Australia to go back to days where the only effective penetration our industries had was on the domestic market. They want our industries to be restricted to a domestic market of 17 million people and ignore the immense benefits of moving into markets of billions of people in the Asia-Pacific. They want to limit Australia and its economic aspirations to our small domestic market, the old failed mantra, the old failed model of McEwen, Doug Anthony, Menzies and Fraser. It is totally inconsistent with what this government is achieving by opening up international and regional markets for the benefits of free trade with effective market penetration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it is all said and done, there is a clear difference in the trade and economic policies on the various sides of this parliament. The difference is this: the Labor Party wants to see Australia develop into much more than a quarry and a farm. The National and Liberal parties would limit us to this by not allowing our manufacturing and service industries to penetrate markets in the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a re-run of the failed coalition policies from the 1950s and 1960s, and it is an immense shame for this nation and its future trading position. Only this government has had the capacity to develop a sophisticated trading strategy. Only this government, with its Labor leadership, has had the capacity to smash the McEwen legacy, to open up the economy, and secure Australia's place in the world's most dynamic and fastest growing region, the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen, in recent decades, how the world has been breaking into trade groupings&mdash;most notably, the European Union and NAFTA. Australia, by culture and geography, has had no natural grouping to slide into, so we have had to make our way into APEC. We have had to bring together the Asia-Pacific as a new form of trade architecture and develop a new trade forum. We have made our way into the Asia-Pacific and APEC by virtue of leadership. The benefits of leadership, Labor leadership, Keating leadership, have brought together the Asia-Pacific as Australia's trade grouping in response to the way in which Europe and North America had been forming trade blocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Osaka achievements are essentially four-fold. The first is that the Osaka agreement, the Osaka achievement, confirms the Asia-Pacific grouping and does not allow any backsliding to a solely Asian economic and trade forum. It is the preference, of course, of Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, to have an Asian-only economic and trade grouping. I would have thought that the recognition by other Asian nations at APEC of the need for an Asian-Pacific focus signals the end of what has been known as the Asian values debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it is all said and done, Mahathir is just a crude version of Lee Kwan Yew, arguing that only Asian values can sustain long-term economic growth and competitiveness. The truth is that Asian values are very diverse throughout that region, reflecting the diversity of culture and outlook. Asian values do have benefits for producing dynamic growth economies, but so too do other values and cultures. It is very significant that in Singapore they are now talking about the Pacific way, a flexible combination of Eastern and Western values and culture. The Pacific way is a very good reflection and summary of the orientation that Australia can take in terms of culture, innovation and trade outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second achievement at Osaka was to keep agriculture in the cart, as part of the APEC agreement. This is a very difficult matter, and I am always interested in debates such as  this to hear and learn of the tension between globalism and localism. We have seen in recent decades economic and political power around the world gravitate towards global and local arenas. There are tensions in an issue like this because we have various speakers in this debate and in other forums talking about the benefits of global free trade, but they are sometimes not too comfortable when they have to deal with the local consequences of those economic relations and economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a tension between global economic benefits and local consequences, a tension that politicians and public policy decision makers are constantly grappling with. Agriculture is part of that because, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a romance that is built into the culture and the mythology of those who work the land. Agriculture has electoral consequences, not just in Japan, not just in the European nations, but also in Australia. We all know the consequences of the electoralism of the rural lobby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at the end of the day&mdash;and the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) would appreciate this&mdash;agricultural protection and agricultural subsidies are just another form of business welfare. In Europe in particular&mdash;and I am sure this will be reflected ultimately in the Asia-Pacific&mdash;there is a change in public opinion. Why should manufacturing and service sector workers exposed to international competition, not receiving subsidies from government, see agriculture receive subsidies and protection? Not only that, they pay higher prices for their agricultural produce as consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no question that public opinion is picking up this theme in Europe. It has picked it up in this country. The National Party of Australia is now a protectionist rump, totally irrelevant to the mainstream of the debate. I am very confident that those shifts in public opinion will be reflected throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Having kept agriculture in the cart at Osaka, it will stay in the cart because of that inevitable shift in public opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third achievement at Osaka is to see the first down payment on regional cooperation and its trade benefits. Free trade in the region will boost Australia's GDP by 6.8 per cent or $40 billion per annum and create 500,000 new jobs by the year 2010. Regional output for the APEC nations will increase by 3.8 per cent. The first down payment, most notably in phasing down of protectionist measures in Indonesia and China, is coming onto the agenda for Australia's immense benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth achievement of Osaka&mdash;and this is a marvel of modern government&mdash;is that APEC reflects a logical response to the globalisation of capital. I have previously quoted in the House the way in which the McKinsey organisation has projected that international investment will reach $83 trillion by the year 2000. It is sensible, given that dimension of investment and trade around the world and the mobility of capital, for governments to defend their interests and continue their countervailing role by cooperating together. If capital is globalising itself, the institutions of government and the decision making processes also need to act within a global framework. Economic power is shifting to the global arena and it is logical for political power to also move to that arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is a very important reflection of how governments can cooperate for free trade and investment. It reflects the way in which the European Union has established similar arrangements but gone even further, with the Maastricht Treaty for a single currency and monetary union by the end of this decade.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But it goes back a bit further&mdash;to the previous Labor Party Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and, before him, Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not just focus on the narrow band of the Osaka meeting that has just taken place and the results that have come out of that. There have been a number of meetings. Let us go back to the first meeting in Seattle in 1993. Last year, there was the Bogor meeting, out of which came the Bogor declaration, which basically set out the goals of the APEC group for trade liberalisation by the years 2010 and 2020. This year, the recently completed Osaka meeting put together an action agenda setting out the principles which will underpin, I suppose, the process of trade liberalisation and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific region, as we move towards those target dates that were established in Bogor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As some of the previous speakers have said, this is good and well.

It has been right that we have gone down a different path from that of Malaysia, which wanted to see a purely Asian trading bloc rather than a Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is important that we recognise what has happened and what has been locked in place so far. It is important to note the size and the emphasis of the trading bloc itself. The 18 APEC economies account for about 60 per cent of the world's GDP and about 50 per cent of the world's trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversely, we should have a look at what Australia's share of the world's trade and the world's GDP actually is. It is undeniable that Australia's share of East Asian imports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years. Since 1983, we have lost some market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei. Our merchandise trade surplus within the APEC region has declined from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to maintain perspective in this whole discussion. A bit of emphasis needs to be put on the fact that it is an enormous trading block as far as its market share within the world GDP and trading areas is concerned. Australia's share of that has been declining. We have to pay attention to and try to quell that declining involvement in the APEC area. To that end, what is being established and put in place should address that situation. It really is incumbent upon the members of the APEC group and this government and future governments involved in sitting around that table, whether it be the Prime Minister of the day or the trade minister of the day, to ensure that APEC creates confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Countries like China must change the way disputes are dealt with, because we have seen in the world trade arena in recent times the larger trading nations around the world departing from some of their commitments. We have seen the United States departing from its commitment to the GATT agreement and subsiding some of its agricultural products. Because there is no locked-in, legalistic agreement involved in the APEC group, we are taking some of these nations at their word, and anybody who has been in business should know that you need a little bit more commitment than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming up to the meeting in the Philippines next year some attention has to be paid to how disputes are going to be resolved&mdash;whether sanctions should be involved in a written form that the group can impose on other members that are not abiding by the agreements that have been reached in heading towards that trade liberalisation by the years 2010 and 2020. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important as we move towards the next meeting in the Philippines in 1996 that there should be some code of practice adopted to deal with trade disputes in an orderly manner. Let us not fool ourselves: they will arise. Domestic political pressures will always be brought to bear on governments in the different countries that are members of APEC. It is going to take a great deal of steel on their behalf to resist those domestic pressures from time to time. I have instanced some of the things that have taken place&mdash;some of the actions that have been taken by the American government with regard to export enhancement of wheat and dairy products. That was done despite the signing of the GATT agreement. The World Trade Organisation got under way on 1 July this year. But these things are still happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Asia-Pacific region it is very important that established within the agreement there is some code of practice that will deal with trade disputes, and there may be a need for the development and the institutionalisation of some sort of sanction to be involved. In addressing the prime ministerial statement, I think that it is important that we acknowledge those elements of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we acknowledge the background of APEC and how it has reached the stage it is at today. Its development has not come about as a result of the current government or the current Prime Minister. APEC has developed and evolved over a number of years. Sure, the current government has played an active role in a few of the latter meetings to develop the APEC group, but APEC certainly goes further back than that and that should be acknowledged here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an enormous trading region with an enormous share of the world's GDP. We cannot turn our backs on it; we have got to be involved in it. I noted that the Prime Minister in his speech, which I have read, addressed the importance of Australia as being the `food bowl for South-East Asia'. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has referred to Australia as the `supermarket of Asia'. That is very true; and every member in this house, politics aside, would recognise that. We have to be working together as a nation in trying to re-establish ourselves in this area where the Australian share of trade over recent years has declined. We have got to rekindle that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as we have this very strong focus on South-East Asia or the APEC group, which also includes New Zealand, the United States of America and Canada, on the Asia-Pacific rim, let us not lose sight of the fact that we have some very strong and important trading links and commitments with the United Kingdom and with Europe. We all, particularly those of us in affected electorates&mdash;and I include you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, with a semirural electorate&mdash;acknowledge the problems that we face in dealing on a trade basis with the European Union, particularly on agricultural products with the existence of the CAP and the problems that that presents to Australian exporters of agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains, however, that we have very important trade links with Europe and we have extremely important trade links with the United Kingdom. I think that we might be the third largest investor in the United Kingdom, and it works in reverse as well. Whilst we are focusing very strongly on the APEC group, the Asia-Pacific region, we cannot lose sight of the importance of those other trade agreements and trade areas or that we have established those links with Europe and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note some of the achievements or the agreements that have come out of the recent APEC meeting. The results of those agreements for different nations have meant different things. In speaking on trade liberalisation in this parliament since I have been a member, I have always been a touch cynical about the downstream benefits, the outcomes of the agreements that we have entered into, and the speed at which Australia is heading down that trade liberalisation path by comparison with other nations. I immediately instance the European countries, the EEC, still clinging onto the CAP. As far as I am concerned, we are ahead in the game in reducing our tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept for one moment the rubbish that the member for Werriwa came up with in regard to protectionist and isolationist policies of the current coalition. That is not the case; such policies do not exist. It is a very fallacious comment that has been made by the member for Werriwa but it is something we have come to expect from him in his speeches in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been a touch sceptical about the commitment of all countries around the world, particularly to the GATT agreement, and the pace at which we are reducing tariff measures such as subsidies and the like. We are exposing our industries to the world market at a much faster pace than are other signatories to some of these agreements. It is of the utmost importance and it is incumbent upon this government, this Prime Minister, this Minister for Trade&mdash;and future prime ministers and ministers for trade representing Australia as we move forward in our participation in the APEC group&mdash;that we make sure that it is all done on a quid pro quo basis, that we get access to the marketplaces in South-East Asia equal to the access that everybody else gets, on the same basis or the best basis that we possibly can. I do not believe that that has been achieved through the GATT Uruguay Round and under the processes that are being undertaken now by the World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tariff reductions that have been agreed to in the GATT round are on the basis of a percentage reduction per annum. That is relative to the base that all those nations started from. We are not saying by the year 2000 everybody is going to be on a 10 per cent level or a five per cent level for a specific product. We are talking about a percentage per year, so the relativity goes back to what base each country started from. As far as I am concerned, it is going to be a long time in that process before all the nations that we are trading with and that are signatories to the GATT are going to end up on the same level, on a quid pro quo basis of equal access into each other's marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not see that as being the case in APEC. Let us focus on having equitable trade relations with these countries, where we have equal access to each other's markets&mdash;as has been established, and was instanced by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his speech, in the development of the CER. We have opened up economic relations with New Zealand on a quid pro quo basis. Those are the things that we must focus on from this day forward. What has been achieved has been very good. The ground rules have been laid out. It is now up to everybody involved in APEC to observe those ground rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, it behoves me to highlight the fact that in this agreement we are moving forward, and we support what is happening as far as trade liberalisation is concerned, but, as the NFF has said, it is all well and good to participate in these agreements for trade liberalisation but it is not good enough if manufacturing and production industries have to continue working in the worst set of circumstances in the nation. Domestic micro-economic reform in Australia has stalled. It has stalled and we have to crank it up if we are going to compete with these countries, because they do not work on that basis. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite those naysayers and gloom merchants who have again proven themselves incapable of gauging regional interest and the climate of change, the Prime Minister's successful stewardship of Australia's agenda at APEC means that we now live in a place with a decidedly changed future. Australians must be proud of the outcomes of this latest meeting, not solely because of the benefits it will eventually provide for us and for our children, but also because Australia and APEC are one and the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is an Australian initiative. APEC stands as a symbol of our nation's coming of age, and of our neighbours' recognition that we can play&mdash;and will continue to play&mdash;an important role in our region. No matter how much the opposition attempts to claw back some of the limelight for itself, APEC was an initiative of a Labor federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in his speech to the Asia-Australian Institute, tried to sneak onto centre stage and dip his foot in the spotlight by saying it was a coalition initiative that provided the foundations for APEC&mdash;harking back to Malcolm Fraser's dalliances with the Japanese in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the debate today a lot of the coalition members have referred to that, with the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) touching on it less than 10 minutes ago. All I can say to the member for Bennelong and the coalition is that they are drawing a very long bow. A few polite conversations do not an international agreement make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC was originally conceived in 1989&mdash;a long time after the member for Bennelong and his coalition at the time bit the political dust. It was a move symbolic of a forward-thinking government with vision, and it remains so today. The government at the time saw Australia's economic and trade future inexorably linked with the `tiger' economies of Asia and the emerging powers of the Pacific. Nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three-quarters of our exports now go to this region, compared with 65 per cent in the early 1980s. The Australian orchestrators of APEC enjoyed the combination of being able to see into the future and having a great deal of commonsense. In saying that they could see into the future, I do not for a minute entertain the notion that those members of the Labor government in 1989 had supernatural powers&mdash;not quite. I think anyone, any member of the government, should have been able to see that by 1989 Australia's future economic survival depended on our becoming enmeshed in the economic fabric of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was because of their commonsense that they could see the way the wind would blow in the coming years. However, seeing the future is not nearly as impressive as being able to become part of it. And that is just what we have been able to achieve here. Six years down the track, with all of the gains we have so far won for all Australians, perhaps it is time to spell out again, for their benefit, what the success of APEC and a strong APEC agreement means to the future of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the recent comments of the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) that most Australians have heard about APEC but that not many know what it means for Australian businesses, the Australian economy, or for the average Australian in terms of jobs and other opportunities. As with any major development involving our nation's economy or trade performance, there is a propensity for our economic boffins to take the reins and guide debate above the heads of ordinary Australians. The successes of APEC are just too important to let that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a great tragedy for Australians to have APEC and all that it means slide by without demonstrating to them that the agreement is a defining moment in our nation's history. One of the features of the federal Labor government, during its 12 years in office, has been its direction of our foreign, trade and economic policies towards Asia. Australia's role in Asia has at times become a divisive issue; it has been championed, chastised and chattered about with increasing frequency. Some neighbours have at times questioned our motives and the commitment behind our intentions&mdash;quite rightly so, given this nation's chequered history in its dealings with the region. Others have welcomed our involvement in regional affairs with open arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our relationship with the Asia-Pacific region has strengthened, and in particular with Asia, it has meant that Australians have had to address extremely important issues related to our history, our heritage and our future. Throughout the history of Australia since white settlement, from colonial settlement through Federation, the two world wars and into the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, our nation has deferred to the power of the United Kingdom or the United States on most matters of international importance. By looking to take a leading role in Asia and committing ourselves wholeheartedly to APEC, Australia over the last 12 years has signalled to the world that its relationship with these two nations, and the way in which it sees itself, has now changed. I am sure that this will be a talking point for historians and social commentators for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will point to Gallipoli, or to the defiance of Prime Minister Curtin in his dealings with the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, or the role of Doc Evatt and his appointment as the President of the United Nations General Assembly, or even to the events of November 1975, as occasions when Australia had its eyes opened to the realities of the world and its place in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these discussions I will have to beg to differ. In my view, it is our emerging relationship with Asia&mdash;a region culturally, economically and socially different to ourselves&mdash;and specifically with APEC, which signals Australia's real coming of age. Achieving Federation during the dying groans of the British Empire, and beginning to trust our abilities at a time when the United States has once again turned its attention upon itself, we have finally become confident enough to stand on our own two feet by admitting our future lies with Asia. It promises great changes, great possibility and great challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strong APEC agreement, and Australia's position in that agreement, does not only mean a flow-on of economic benefits, although this is one of the major results. It means that the changes that have been discussed so frequently concerning Australia's role with its traditional partners, the UK and the US, have finally and decisively begun to take shape. With it will come gradual changes to our society, our cultural life and the way that we see ourselves as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mean that Sydney will become Hong Kong or that Melbourne will become Jakarta. Australia will always remain Australia, but by organising APEC and ushering its members forward, cementing agreements, finalising objectives and orchestrating what will eventually become the greatest trading boom the world has ever seen Australia has suddenly stopped standing in the corner with its shoulders hunched like some awkward adolescent young boy waiting to be allowed to join in the conversation of the adults. Australia is now stepping forward confidently as a young adult, responsible and ready to work with our immediate partners. Apart from what APEC means for us historically, for our standing in the region or for our own self-confidence, it spells economic gains that at the moment seem potentially limitless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned before that 75 per cent of all Australia's exports now go to the region. It is perhaps more important to place that 75 per cent of exports into context with the rest of the region. One thing that needs to be impressed upon Australians is the economic enormity of the Asia-Pacific region. As our Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, the 18 APEC countries already account for 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half of its trade. More goods are now traded within the area, one country to another, than are traded within North America or the European Community. Sixty-six per cent of APEC countries' exports go to member states whereas in the European Community it is 61 per cent and in the North American free trade agreement it is 42 per cent. We are dealing with economic muscle power of an almost mind-boggling dimension. Better though than just contemplating it, we are actively harnessing that energy in great leaps and bounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the agreements that makes APEC unique is that the leaders of APEC countries have now set themselves concrete objectives. Despite initial reservations from individual nations, the goals that have been set are achievable and I wager they will be achieved by those set dates. Those nations that have approached APEC's goals somewhat hesitatingly no doubt really know that the agreement is entirely within their best interest, just as it is in Australia's, to bring down tariff walls and to promote free trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has stated in this House, while representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Trade, it is expected that APEC will increase income for all its members to the tune of some $993 billion when its combined effects flow through. That is $993 billion for everybody, and in particular the developing nations within APEC. The mind boggles at such a figure. As our minister pointed out, that is worth more than the Australian and South Korean economies combined, more than 10 times the size of the Malaysian economy and 1 1/2 times the size of China's economy&mdash;spread across all 18 APEC nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we may rejoice at what APEC means for ourselves, we must remember that it is not a one-way street. We are not going to reap the benefits at another country's expense and I believe the lesser developed nations that have joined in APEC can see that as well. Our APEC goals of promoting open markets throughout the region are fully consistent with our neighbours' desires to create growth and jobs for their own people. Open markets generate growth. It is as simple as that. Setting ourselves such clear objectives makes the job of harnessing the economic muscle power of the Asia-Pacific region so much easier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have something to work towards. The APEC countries are not simply indulging in economic fantasies. They are not pushing ideas across the table at each other like some overrated private think-tank. They are working towards tangible, reachable goals. With each meeting we take one step forward. Sometimes they are bigger than others, but we are heading in a definite direction with our goals firmly in sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about taking steps forward, I was particularly interested to hear the statement by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, in the House yesterday in support of the Prime Minister's success in Osaka and, as such, his leadership in previous APEC meetings. I am pleased&mdash;and I am glad that the member for Bennelong is in the chamber&mdash;that the opposition now supports the government's handling of our involvement in APEC. Yet I must point out that, despite the honourable member's repeated assurances that his comments in no way begrudge the government's vision, the messages that his colleagues have been sending the Australian people over the previous few weeks in the lead-up to the APEC meeting have been contrary to this. I, like everybody else, have watched the evening news and read the newspapers over the last few weeks. Virtually all the members of the opposition who were discussing APEC have come out and said that they had hoped the Prime Minister would fail in Osaka, meaning they hoped Australia would fail. How courageous of them. How full of national pride they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that they are jealous of this government's achievements. Their front bench is bereft of a single person with any vision for our nation. They talk about their Lord Caseys and their Andrew Peacocks but they have long gone. Who can they talk about now? The member for Mayo (Mr Downer)? I can see him as Australia's foreign minister, bobbing up and down like a very errant little schoolboy. The coalition wants to dance to a tune that was playing in this country in the 1950s and 1960s. All I can say is that it is now a new tune and they had better learn to dance to that quick smart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Prime Minister on Tuesday, in talking about the success of Osaka, made a comment which I think should be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He has stated that we are stepping into a ring well above our weight and we are fighting well above there. That is, I believe, an effective way of illustrating the position that Australia, with its population of 18 million, now takes in leading APEC to the success that the countries want to see it achieve. I commend the Prime Minister for his actions. I commend the government on this step forward and particularly on the statement that was delivered here on APEC. </PARA>

<PARA>Like all Australians, I was horrified to learn of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. Few people in international public life are called on to make decisions of such weight and consequence as those that he had to make. And few have done so with such courage and clear-eyed vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yitzhak Rabin was a remarkable individual. His whole life was dominated by his absolute commitment to the state of Israel and to its people. From his birth in Jerusalem in 1922 he was at or near the centre of most events which created and shaped his country. His life was devoted first to the foundation of Israel, and then to ensuring its survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years Mr Rabin expressed this commitment through his distinguished career as a soldier. He fought in the 1948 War of Independence, then served for more than 20 years as a member of the Israeli Defence Force. His military career culminated in his appointment as Chief of Staff of the IDF and its commander during the Six-Day War. After five years as Israel's ambassador to the United States, Mr Rabin returned to Israel in 1973 to enter politics. Just as his military career was driven by his unswerving commitment to Israel's security, so was his life as a political leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that deep commitment never changed, its form did&mdash;and quite profoundly. During his second term as Prime Minister after 1992, Mr Rabin came to the view cautiously&mdash;almost reluctantly, but I believe irresistibly&mdash;that the cause to which he had committed his life, that is Israel's survival and security, was now best served by a sustained effort to negotiate a settlement with the Palestinians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This did not represent any change in his fundamental beliefs. But he had the imagination and the courage to recognise that military superiority alone could not deliver lasting security for Israel. And he understood that a change of approach of parallel importance was taking place among the Palestinian leadership as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This represented a fundamental shift in policy for Israel and many Israelis, of course, were unsettled by it. Possibly only Rabin, with his unassailable reputation as a defender of Israel's security, could have carried most of the country with him in following this new path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The breakthrough came with the signature on 13 September 1993 of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles. In that document, for the first time ever, Israel and the Palestinians recognised each other as part of the same neighbourhood and accepted the need to deal with each other as neighbours. That historic recognition was symbolised when Mr Rabin shook the hand of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on the lawn at the White House in September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That handshake was the beginning, not the end, of a process. Despite the intense political pressure Mr Rabin came under, pressure which went well beyond the normal and acceptable bounds of political debate, he remained determined to keep the peace process going. Under his leadership, the peace treaty with Jordan was signed in October 1994 and then the interim agreement with the Palestinians, just two months before his death. The worth and substance of Mr Rabin's achievements not just for Israel but for the Middle East and the world were recognised when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, together with Mr Shimon Peres and the PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great shock of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination was not so much that it happened, as shocking as that was, as violence in the politics of the Middle East is tragically common; it was that he was killed by another Israeli. At the core of Israel's existence has always been its role as a sanctuary for the Jewish people. His assassin has done more than rob us all of the life and potential of Yitzhak Rabin, he has cheated the Jewish people of the security of the belief to which so many Israelis had dedicated themselves, that Israel was a place where above all else human rights and human happiness were the foundations and strengths of the society. </PARA>

He was the defence minister who gave the order for the Israeli commanders who recaptured those who had been taken hostage at Entebbe in Uganda by the Palestinians in 1976. He then entered domestic politics after a period of time as ambassador to the United States. After encountering some reverses in his first stint as Prime Minister, he spent a long period in Israeli politics, finally returning only a few years ago to deliver the finest hour of his political contribution to the country in which he was born and the country that he loved so much. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all the more poignant that these terrible events actually occurred in the 50th year of the conclusion of hostilities in World War II. The really defining event of that war was the Holocaust. It was out of the Holocaust that came the international sentiment with the Jewish people that led to the creation of the state of Israel. The state of Israel was a matter of survival. That war also saw the beginning of Yitzhak Rabin's career as a soldier.

He then fought in the struggle to make real the United Nations creation of Israel immediately after that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an extraordinary thing, and an indication of the quality of the man, that at a very young age he would be one of the principal negotiators for Israel on the separation of the forces.

It is impossible for us to understand or comprehend what being confronted daily with the horror of annihilation, and with the experience of it, does to a mind, particularly a military mind.

There is no doubt that we see in his death, and especially in the means of his death, an attempt to destroy one of the most important initiatives of peace since the Second World War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yitzhak Rabin's initiatives have to be looked at in the context that, prior to them, there had been so much bitterness, so much hatred and so much conflict in the Middle East and that at one stage even the majority of the peoples of those nations were so afraid to make initiatives for peace. It was an enormous achievement to turn that around and to reach a situation in which there was so much optimism for peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember that in 1992 I had the privilege of leading a parliamentary delegation to the Middle East. In Israel, we were unable to meet with Mr Rabin but we met for quite some time with Mr Peres. At that time the new government had just been elected and had been in power for only a short time. There was discussion as to whether a man with Rabin's background&mdash;his military and general background in the armed forces&mdash;would be willing to really push the peace process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked that question of Mr Peres, and his response was very clear. He said, `Have faith in the Prime Minister of Israel. I know this man. Have faith in him.' I guess that faith was rewarded because soon after that particular meeting we saw big initiatives and, finally, we saw the Oslo declaration and all that other speakers have referred to in terms of the peace process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that bringing together sufficient sense in Israel that peace was possible was not an easy achievement. It involved reassuring the people of Israel over and over, and Rabin's contribution was that. He was able to reassure the people of Israel that whatever steps he was taking were steps that were not in any way going to compromise their security but were going to achieve a positive future for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Shimon Peres, who also played a big role in negotiating the details of much of these agreements, has now taken on the mantle of continuing that process. I think everyone in the international community wishes him well in that. That small group of people who perpetrated this crime or who were behind this crime must not be allowed to succeed. There are extremists and people against peace in every nation and in every group. But, in the end, if humanity is to achieve something positive in this century, it has to achieve a resolution of this long conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the greatest testament to Yitzhak Rabin will be rapid progress towards final peace in the Middle East. I am sure that will be the best thing by which we will remember him and his actions. I share in the grief of the Australian Jewish community, of the people of Israel and, indeed, of most of the Australian community about what has occurred to this individual. But I am also optimistic in my belief because of the statements of all the Arab leaders&mdash;King Hussein, Yasser Arafat and many of the others&mdash;about their determination to continue the peace process. Let us hope that that will be the lasting memory of Yitzhak Rabin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The great challenge left to the world by the tragic assassination of Yitzhak Rabin is to ensure his determination to broker lasting peace in the Middle East is continued. He has left a legacy of hope. It is very much up to his successor and the rest of the world to build on that hope and to develop it into tangible reality. Yitzhak Rabin was one of the few people in the world who can properly be described as truly great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After becoming Prime Minister of Israel in June 1992, he concentrated all of his efforts on bringing peace to the Middle East. It was a role perhaps that contrasted with his military career, which had in itself been distinguished. Rabin was the man behind the 1967 Six-Day War in which Israel seized territory from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. He was the man behind the June 1967 raid on Entebbe, Uganda, where commandos rescued more than 100 Israelis from a plane hijacked by Palestinians. This was the same man who shook hands with PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Washington in September 1993 and King Hussein of Jordan in July 1994 and who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Yasser Arafat just last year&mdash;1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under his guidance, the first Israeli-PLO agreement was signed, paving the way for autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza, and a formal peace treaty was signed with Jordan, ending a 46-year-old state of war. Just six days before his death, he and Arafat signed a further agreement expanding Palestinian autonomy. Rabin, at 73 years of age, was turning dreams of peace in the Middle East into reality&mdash;and he was central to that process. Without him, there would have been no secret talks in Oslo between Israel and Palestine, no meetings in Washington and no signing of peace accords. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge is not to let his tragic death stop the momentum, but rather to ensure that it brings a new determination to developing the peace process. The inspiration for that can be found in Mr Rabin's last public speech to 100,000 people at one of Tel Aviv's biggest peace rallies, on 4 November, the day of his death. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The path of peace is preferable to the path of war. This is a soldier telling you this, a defence minister, a man who sees the pain of the families of soldiers in mourning. . .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and my other colleagues I would like to add a few words to this motion&mdash;for three reasons. The first is that the death of a world leader leaves a gap that is inevitably hard to fill. When a man like Yitzhak Rabin, who had contributed so much in war and in peace, is assassinated by one of his fellow countrymen,</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>how great that gap is and how profound the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason is that Australia is now very much a cosmopolitan and multinational society. We no longer are oriented in one direction and we are not just oriented within ourselves. We very much face outwards. So many people of Jewish origin have contributed so much to this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Asher Joel, a very distinguished Jewish leader in our society, was a parliamentary colleague during my early days in politics. He was one of those who took me under his wing. From him I learnt not only of the extent to which the Jewish people have made a contribution to our society in Australia, but how a people who have suffered for so long and to such a great degree have contributed to making Israel the strong, solid, independent state that it is today. Yitzhak Rabin was the leader who gave them that momentum towards future peace which had been so long denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is that it is particularly appropriate that we have a condolence motion within this parliament. It is hard for us who come from afar to pass judgment on matters in the Middle East; yet over many years Australian service personnel have served in that part of the world. On my one and only visit to Israel I came across the Red Sea, through the Sinai, through the West Bank, through Tel Aviv and into Jerusalem. Each one of those paths that I crossed were paths on which Australian soldiers had fought successively throughout this century. There are avenues of eucalypts in the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have contributed greatly to the growth and development of Israel. Even though Israel is a country that seems so far away and is in a theatre of the world with which we have no immediate geographic contact, it is one with which we have a very strong personal contact. Israel is therefore a country that means a great deal to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a soldier Yitzhak Rabin contributed a great deal towards the creation of the state of Israel and its maintenance. But then he gave it so much more as Prime Minister&mdash;through the Oslo accords and through the negotiation of the peace agreements with Jordan, with Yasser Arafat and with Palestine. I believe that the hope Rabin provided will remain as the principal symbol of his life. To his country, to those very distinguished Australians who are members of the Jewish faith, to the people of Israel and to Yitzhak Rabin's family, I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a person with, I would think, reasonable credentials in support of the aspirations of the Palestinian people over the last few decades, I would like to strongly identify myself with the motion. People have spoken about Washington and about comments by the King of Jordan. Just as relevant and just as symbolic in this whole process was the visit of Chairman Arafat to Leah Rabin's house and his conveyance of the feeling of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened with the Oslo process, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the change in US policy in the Middle East as a result of that&mdash;the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union, for that matter, no longer have client states there and dependence upon countries&mdash;is that the future of Rabin and Arafat obviously became massively intertwined. They both resisted forces and extremes&mdash;in the case of Arafat, Hamas&mdash;and other organisations financed, on many occasions, by countries that have deserted the PLO over many decades for their own self-interest and ironically, on the Israeli side, by religious zealots who in many cases do not even recognise the state of Israel and refuse to participate in its military exercises. Yet, despite this lack of contribution to Israel's needs, they see themselves as having some biblical commitment that says that Israel's government is selling them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That visit by Rabin and the comments of Leah Rabin in the weeks afterwards clearly drive home the immense importance of Rabin's role. He was a man who accomplished things that the Likud could never have accomplished, a man who was essentially there because he could be trusted by a wider spectrum in the electorate, a man who could force change that was very difficult. If there is one contribution that should be made it should be a commitment on a bipartisan basis in this country that Australia will continue to endorse strongly that peace process and will continue to give comfort and support to those forces that are facing massive challenges from extremists on either side.

While I was there I had the honour, on a number of occasions, of meeting Yitzhak Rabin, who was then Israel's ambassador to the United States. Much has been said here today about this remarkable man. He was remarkable not only because of his military achievements but also because he was the first Sabra&mdash;the first Prime Minister of the state of Israel actually born in Israel, or in Palestine as it then was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was sent to the United States as ambassador as part of a grooming process, because there have been a series of Israeli leaders who had that experience. He came back and served two terms as Prime Minister of his country. Significantly, in the elections of June 1992 he was re-elected as Prime Minister because he was willing to `trade land for peace'. I cannot adequately explain to the House the significance of those words in the context of Israel's circumstance throughout its relatively short modern history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1967 war left Israel in a very strong geographic and military position in the Middle East, but it did not bring peace. By 1992 there was a growing perception that a deal had to be made with the Palestinian population. The concept of security in the past had been based on `creating facts'; build a cordon sanitaire around Israel was the only way to protect Israel. In that environment, where security was all important, it was Yitzhak Rabin, the former general, who had the courage of his convictions to take his country on a new course. He persisted with that right to the very moment of his death. Perhaps the greatest poignancy of that event is that we are all here today so many thousands of miles away from where the tragic event took place, but we in our own way share the pain and the suffering of the Israeli people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other event that I recall which has any comparison, and it is a very strong comparison, was at the Munich Olympics, when the massacre of the Israeli athletes took place. I had to meet the plane at Lod airport and I can tell this House that I saw a nation cry. All of us saw on our television screens in recent days, but in different circumstances, a nation cry. We should remember the words of Yitzhak Rabin when he was presented with his Nobel Peace Prize. It is important to remember whom he shared it with: his colleague and now the Prime Minister, Mr Perez, and Yasser Arafat, the long-time enemy of the Israel people and the representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, which for so long had set as its primary objective the destruction of the state of Israel. Those three men between them changed all that. They changed the face of modern history as far as the Middle East was concerned. On that occasion he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the whole nation, for the citizens of the state of Israel, for the bereaved families and the disabled, for the hundreds of thousands who have fought in Israel's war, today the Palestinians face the moment of truth.

If the July 1944 attempt had succeeded, the terrible suffering of the last months of the war might have been shortened. But this would have been quite an exceptional case.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was no secret that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres had radically different approaches within the Israeli Labour Party. They were rivals for decades. Rabin's role as a general was critically important. He had been seen as a hardliner whose professional career was tied up with military action and physical survival. For Rabin, as an old soldier, to commit himself to the peace process was politically far more significant than was the commitment of Shimon Peres, who was seen as an archetypical civilian and, even worse, a diplomat.

We must set ourselves very strongly against violence, intolerance and the arrogance of the individual who says, `I may not have a rational argument to make, but I speak with the authority of the gun in my pocket.'

Unfortunately, there are nations in the region who still refuse to recognise the state of Israel. They still refuse to recognise the fact that after 3,000 years the Jewish people have come home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition's vote against the privatisation of Sydney airport and the other airports will be a defining moment in John Howard's leadership of the opposition. This is the person who has told us that the country needs more micro-economic reform. This is the person who has told us that the third runway in Sydney should have been built. This is the person who said, `All this scare talk about noise is an exaggeration. I have lived there.' This is the person who consistently pressed the government to build it. He is out there telling the business community that we need more micro-economic reform, and, in the principal micro-economic reform of airport services in this country&mdash;that is, the privatisation of them, their capital adequacy, the addition to capacity&mdash;he has held it hostage. For what reason? Because he has got a thin margin in his own seat&mdash;because of his own miserable seat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a person who will have you believe that he would, with gusto and with principle, cut into government spending. This is a person who would manage the budget into structural surpluses. But, at the first whiff of grapeshot, there he goes for the smother. But worse than that&mdash;displaying his weakness in the House&mdash;he then has the Senate vote against the measures, which has delayed the process of the privatisation and which, of course, will cost the budget an enormous amount of revenue next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was only one view here, and that was the view from the headland of Bennelong. The headland speech was a speech of political cowardice, a speech of political opportunism and was basically about trying to put a smokescreen over the fact that he stood for this change and now thinks that, because he did, he might lose his seat. This is a person who believes that he can become Prime Minister of Australia but who is transfixed upon holding his own seat. Apparently in his private conversation he is besotted by this fact that he might lose his own seat. So here he is now knocking this over in the Senate to say, `Unless you put a cross-runway in, we won't allow the proper passage of these things through the budget process.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means on either end of the east-west runway, were the government to agree and turn over all the safety considerations, we would have many more people affected by the configuration of the airport runways at Mascot. There will be a huge increase in people affected by noise. He does not mind that, because he has given those electorates up. So, as far as he is concerned, they can cop the noise and the rest of us can cop the lack of safety from a runway intersecting with the flight paths of two parallel runways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, will have profoundly negative effects on every aspect of the Australian and New South Wales aviation, tourism and travel industries. The decision will increase operational risks for all passengers and planes using Sydney airport; increase the numbers of Sydney residents and the suburbs affected; force travellers from rural and regional New South Wales, and Australia generally, to incur greatly increased fares and travel times if they wish to use Sydney airport; delay the development of Badgerys Creek airport, which will prolong adverse noise effects on suburbs to the north of Sydney airport; and massively increase air and road traffic congestion at the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also cripple well advanced plans in Victoria and South Australia to upgrade their airport facilities, and, in doing that, put back the opportunities that they will have to expand their market at a time when East Asian incomes are rising and when interest in Melbourne and in Adelaide is rising. He will, as a consequence of his actions, see that these two cities forgo these opportunities for growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC's most attractive and valuable asset, Sydney, is the key element in a sales strategy which reflects expert financial and commercial advice. By Sydney not being part of the process, the opposition amending the airport bills in the Senate to excise Sydney and Sydney West from the bills means that, unless the east-west runway is reopened at Sydney, the whole process will not be able to be completed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This makes even more important the presence of the commission in this structure and indicates why the Leader of the Opposition's view that he will stab it in the stomach will simply take it from the process and these workers would only be defended by industrial action and the country would return to the conflict model that it had when John Howard was the Treasurer&mdash;590 working days lost per thousand compared with 70 working days lost per thousand under this government.

Quite properly, the Minister for Industrial Relations engaged the president of the arbitration commission at a time when it became very obvious that the company and the unions were not going to agree between themselves. The company was still pressing words in its four-point agreement around the question of unequal work for equal pay and the union would not abide that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the proposals referred to by the honourable member in her question. The proposals received very warm support on Sydney radio yesterday afternoon from none other than the Leader of the Opposition. I might say that this is the same Leader of the Opposition whose bombing raid on Sydney only this week involved the great private member's bill that allows for 24-hour uninterrupted operations on the east-west runway without a curfew&mdash;the same private member's bill that described the eastern approaches as the western approaches and the western approaches as the eastern approaches. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who this week, by using and abusing his numbers in the Senate in blocking the government's airport leasing legislation, has significantly delayed the construction of Badgerys Creek airport and thus denied relief for those living in the approaches to Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is his latest effort yesterday that is absolutely the coup de grace. I can advise the House that Airservices Australia has analysed the FAIRA and TALOW proposals which the Leader of the Opposition yesterday described as `intelligently put together'. Indeed, he went further than that. He said they were being entertained by Airservices Australia at his instigation&mdash;that he had personally intervened and was ensuring that these proposals were going forward. Depending on the premise you start with, they may have been intelligently put together, but Airservices Australia have intelligently taken them apart. By holding them out as a solution, the only person who fails the intelligence test is the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal first with the TALOW proposal which involves nose-to-nose southerly operations over Botany Bay at all times. That means a plane going out and a plane coming in directly towards each other. Real bright! This may well be a noble objective but, unfortunately, to operate it safely you have reduced the airport's movement rate to about 20. You get about 20 movements out of the airport using that configuration. Given that the peak demand is 65, and is rising at times to over 80 per hour, you can imagine what that means. You don't have to be a genius to work out that it means huge delays at Kingsford Smith airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the FAIRA proposal which favours the confining of take-offs to the east and the west and landings from the south. Airservices Australia has released a statement, which I would be happy to table with the leave of the House. It has advised that, by confining take-offs to the one runway, we would not meet the movement rates that are required and it would involve a concentration of complex arrival and departure cross-overs in a small area to the east of the airport. Indeed, Airservices Australia categorically rejects the proposals and reaffirms its view that, from safety and capacity perspectives, parallel runway operations are the preferred operating environment at the airport and, wherever possible, airport operations are designed to avoid intersecting runways and reduce possible conflicts in air space around airports.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations has told the House repeatedly about the level of coverage under the federal award. I think just on 60 per cent of all employees covered by a federal award are under an enterprise bargain. We are starting to see very strong productivity as a result of that enterprise bargaining system. That is one of the things that has kept the inflation rate down and has seen real wages and profits rise. So high productivity is being shared between profits and wages but is protecting the inflation rate. That is the way any sensible labour market should operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But you opposite are about something different altogether. You want to get people to be just on their own, their single selves, dealing with a company or an employer and, if they do not like what is offered to them, they can get out. That is the model you want; you want the American model. The thing that has never seemed to dawn on you is that even though there have been falling real wages in America for years as the American Secretary of Labor lamented some months ago, the economy still has a two to 2 1/2 per cent speed limit. It has not improved the flexibility of the American economy. It has not added to its supply capacity whatsoever. As a consequence, all you have is an army of working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave the figures in the House recently. Seventy-five per cent of the increment of American wealth in the last decade went to the top three per cent of the population. That is the model they want. The model we want is one where there is an equitable division of the national wealth coming through a properly operating enterprise bargaining system. We have an accord; it is all out there in public. It has the safety nets, the dates and the amounts. Everything the government stands for is out there, written down in the documents for all the public to see and understand. But you go around telling people fibs, saying, `We will give you a choice,' knowing that the choice is the contract or the sack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can see it at Comalco, where it was said, `We'll pay you more to take the contract, but, once we get you in the bin, you will take what we give you. We will pay you more to get the union out, but, once you bite from the poisoned apple, you will regret it later.' At least 75 people at Weipa will not bite from the poisoned apple because they know that, if they take the money, in the end they will take what Comalco gives them and there will be no negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what John Howard stands for. I have said it before and I will say it again. I cannot understand how a person who comes from such modest circumstances is so interested in belting into working Australians. I cannot understand why he is interested in ripping into the wages and conditions of ordinary Australians, who need this public process for decent wage determination and fairness and equity in the labour market. He has never stood for these things. The government has happily always stood for them. As a consequence, we have a far more cohesive society than the United States, Great Britain or other countries where these sort of policies of the opposition have been tried. As a consequence, we have low inflation, rising real wages and the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1940.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that sort of model which Australia has really always needed. I am sure that many Australian companies and managers now understand how the model operates. They look and wince at the Comalcos of this world who are screwing the model up and putting the whole model at risk. What they all know quite obviously&mdash;they tell us&mdash;is that if the opposition were to govern Australia we would be back to industrial mayhem and falling real wages. They know what that means. There would not be strikes for a couple of days; you would have them for years all across the country. There would be thousands of Comalcos all across the country. It is a foretaste of what is to come from a coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the trade unions in South Australia want to put Mr Howard's weights up, I say, `Good on them.' At least they will do it publicly and with integrity and will not be like the Free Enterprise Foundation, which collected $7 million on the sly and then funnelled it to the Liberal Party anonymously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, from the time it introduced the cross-media rules, has always believed in diversity in the media and supporting that diversity. That means taking away the grip of the old newspaper groups over television and radio. As a consequence, we now have a television industry that is separate from the print industry and a radio industry that is separate from both of them. As a consequence, we have seen a much greater diversity of ownership in television and radio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have organised companies whose specialist job is simply to run a clutch of radio stations. They are not run as some sort of residual portfolio interests which were acquired by large newspaper groups in the past, such as John Fairfax and Sons or the old Herald and Weekly Times. They are now out there on their own operating on a stand-alone basis. You are all familiar with Southern Cross, Austereo and all the other groups. You are familiar with the names and the organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same has happened in television. The Sydney and Brisbane stations of the Channel 7 network were once owned by John Fairfax and Sons, the publishers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. They are now owned broadly. There is now a substantial interest from Mr Kerry Stokes in Western Australia, who is an independent television owner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the aggregated zones, we had monopolies with local country newspapers. The ownership of television stations is going to groups like Prime Television and others. We are now seeing a substantial diversification in the media. That diversification was threatened when some people thought that they could move beyond the 15 per cent level of ownership and own television and newspapers in the same city. The government supports the principle of media diversity. Last year, it proposed measures to buttress and strengthen the cross-media rules by placing on them an upper limit of 15 per cent in the Broadcasting Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that those measures were passed by the Senate on Tuesday, 21 November and will provide certainty to the issue of media ownership by setting in concrete that 15 per cent. But the opposition says that it believes in diversity of media ownership. Senator Alston has mouthed platitudes declaring that the principles underpinning media policy should be competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest. But what does he do? He votes against the 15 per cent limit which is put there to bring certainty to the cross-media limits, to guarantee the very plurality and diversity he is speaking of. The Leader of the Opposition in 1991 signed a petition which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to oppose the sale of the Fairfax group to any individual or consortium that would result in a greater concentration of media ownership and thus by a diminution of competition in and diversity of information sources in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition happily at the time put his name to that petition. In March 1995, which is far more recently, he was asked by Ray Martin on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the Liberal Party stands. It stands exposed to the hypocrisy of Senator Alston's words and to the hypocrisy of Mr Howard's signature on the petition in 1991. It stands against the principles of competition, plurality, diversity and the national interest. It stands in favour of preference, as it always has. It was no accident under 23 years of coalition government that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> owned television, radio and regional newspapers right throughout the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought and think the royal commission was a disgraceful exercise; it was an abuse of executive government. Let me just quote from Garfield Barwick's book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A radical tory</EMPHASIS>. Let us see what a highly esteemed member and supporter of the Liberal Party had to say. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it remarkable that the public accept the conduct of royal commissions as a means of obtaining evidence, bearing in mind that our forebears revolted against the Star Chamber, which was a standing royal commission of its day. Press and politicians alike seem quite anxious to call for royal commissions in all manner of activities, not pausing to consider that the powers of a royal commission are easily abused. Indeed, the public spectacle of witnesses squirming under questioning by the Commissioner or by his Assisting Council provides dramatic copy for the daily press to the delectation of many of its readers.</PARA>
<PARA>What an apt description of this putrid commission in Western Australia. In the release of this, we had this question of the contact between the Western Australian government and the commission. When Richard Court was pressed on this question late in the afternoon of 21 November, he admitted that his consultant, Richard Elliott, met commission staff prior to the start of public hearings, despite his earlier blanket denials and his claim on 9 May that the royal commission was completely independent of the government. It should be noted that page 12 of the royal commission's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission did not conduct any private hearings.</PARA>
<PARA>This turns out to be untrue.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission refused to disclose to Dr Lawrence's lawyers any details of communications as to the subject matter of the inquiry from Court or anyone on his behalf; the government; the Liberal or National parties; Richard Elliott; or Barbara Campbell. This is the important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attempts by Dr Lawrence's lawyers to cross-examine Court on contact between his staff and the commission were curtailed by Commissioner Marks on the objection of Counsel Assisting.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when Dr Lawrence's counsel attempted to ask Premier Richard Court in this commission whether there had been contact between his staff and the commission, the questions were curtailed by the commissioner. Richard Court said earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of officers from the Ministry of the Premier and Cabinet, including members of the Premier's staff, have had discussions with officers of the royal commission. Such discussions ranged from housekeeping matters relating to the administrative arrangements of the royal commission, through to interviews conducted by investigators, responding to requests for information and appearing before the commission under subpoena. Given the number of people involved and the frequency of contact with officers of the commission both by telephone and in person, it is not possible to identify all such discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>Would some appropriate questioning in the commission by counsel not have been a way of eliciting what advice had gone to the commission, what role there had been and whether Mr Court's political staff had briefed the royal commission before the hearings began? This allegation had been repeated, of course, in the federal parliament on 21 November and 22 November. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 21 November Mr Court denied there had been any liaison between his office and Mr Marks or Ms Vanstone in the lead-up. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence should stop making false claims.</PARA>
<PARA>On 6PR he was asked by Mr Sattler:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So are you saying she just made this up too?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANSWER: Well, it's exactly what I've said.</PARA>
<PARA>But, when pressed, he had to say that his consultant, Richard Elliott, had met commission staff prior to the start of the public hearings. This gives you some idea of why Sir Garfield Barwick made the reference he did. Then in the documents attached to the commission we find that the royal commissioner wrote to the Clerk of Journals of the House of Commons `to secure some authority about the status of rulings made by the President of the Western Australian Legislative Council'. He wrote to the Clerk of Journals. He did not make a reference to Australian parliamentary practice. The response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an excellent compare and contrast account of Speakers' rulings in the UK House of Commons and the Australian Federal House of Representatives in Browning, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, 2nd edition, pages 224-228.</PARA>
<PARA>It then states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may know that royal commissions for investigative purposes are no longer the fashion in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What a glum set of replies from the Clerk of Journals in the House of Commons to this lackey of the Western Australian government, who was not prepared to consult Australian parliamentary practice but wanted some authority for the rulings of the Western Australian president of the upper house. When the Western Australian clerk of the upper house gave his testimony and said that it would have been highly improper for Dr Lawrence or any other member of parliament to stop a petitioner petitioning the chamber, that was completely ignored in the weight of evidence by this hired gun of a commissioner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, Mr Lightfoot said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, you see, because between the time I asked the first question on the week prior to that on Tuesday, 24 November, when I asked the second series of questions relating to the same subject, I'd spoken to Penny Easton who reiterated the information she had with respect to the $200,000 payment was in fact correct. So that's why I put the questions again, and she was quite adamant about it and I recalled her being quite adamant in her very gentle fashion, that the information she received and passed on to me was right. You see, I saw here a subject that had nothing to do with the Family Court but nor to do with WA Inc. and largesse.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did it concern you at the time you were becoming embroiled, if you like, in a dispute that was before the Family Court but also was obviously a very personally traumatic situation of both parties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LIGHTFOOT: No, it didn't worry me a jot.</PARA>
<PARA>None of that was in the terms of reference or before the commission. When finally a couple of years later Brian Mahon Easton put his view in a petition, we had the executive arrainging a $5 million royal commission against a political opponent and your paltry connivance in the terms of reference. So you have, all of you, debased royal commissions in this country. You have debased mightily the value of royal commissions. Whatever residual purpose they have had, you have debased them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I think it is worth recalling exactly what Sir Laurence Street had to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think what needs to be understood is that a royal commission has no connection with the court as such. It has nothing to do with the administration of justice. A royal commission or a commission of inquiry is an instrument of the executive government and they are appointed in order to carry out a task that is put upon them by the executive government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, because they employed a former judge, we are supposed to say, `Oh, well, in that case this star chamber process, where obviously the Court government has briefed the commission beforehand and where the commissioner connived in not allowing questions to be put to Court&mdash;this process is all too.....'&mdash;and we are supposed to say over here&mdash;`Oh, this is dreadful'. And therefore the Leader of the Opposition asked me a question as though Mr McGinty's view that he might testify and give contrary evidence to Ms Lawrence in some way gives this shabby affair any credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace. It is one of the low points of Australian public life. Never before has the viciousness of the coalition been expressed against an individual person. And now, Mr Speaker, they want to deny paying the fees for her representation in the process. Mr Speaker, this is the opposition at its worst. This is the Liberal Party at its worst. Getting compliant judges who have left the bench does not add any credibility whatsoever to the last residual elements of respectability the royal commission process might have.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In particular, if you compare what happened to key economic trends under this government with those that occurred when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country, one sees absolutely startling differences in the outcomes. Let us take economic growth. The average rate of economic growth during the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 2.6 per cent per annum and, under this government, it has been 3 1/2 per cent per annum. That 0.9 per cent might not sound like much to start with but, year after year, over 12 years, 0.9 per cent becomes a hell of a lot of additional GDP. In fact, it is worth $50 billion more.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;$50 billion more of real GDP that we have today than we would have if we had the growth rates under the previous Treasurer before this government came into office. It is as though, Mr Speaker, we have had added another Western Australia, because Western Australia's GDP is some $50 billion. That is the size of the additional increase which has come from this government's higher rate of growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at employment, the rate of employment growth under the previous government whilst the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 0.8 per cent per annum. Under us, it has been 2.3 per cent&mdash;almost three times the rate of employment growth. What does that mean in terms of additional jobs? It means that we have 1.3 million more jobs today than if we had had the rate of employment growth under the previous Treasurer. That means that if we had not had those additional jobs, the unemployment rate today would be 23 per cent if we continued the 0.8 per cent rate of employment growth under the previous government. So one can see a spectacular change in employment outcomes, and Australia is far better off in employment respects under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, in relation to the average rate of inflation, another key economic indicator, under the previous Treasurer, Mr Howard, it was 9.8 per cent per annum. Under this government it has been 5.3 per cent&mdash;just a little over half what it was for the previous government. If Mr Howard's rate of inflation had continued since 1983, prices today would be 70 per cent higher&mdash;not 17 but 70 per cent higher&mdash;today than they actually are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just imagine our exporters trying to export overseas with costs 70 per cent higher. Imagine how our primary producers would be today if they had to face costs 70 per cent higher. Obviously the Australian economy would be in diabolical straits if the inflation rate of the previous government had continued over the last dozen years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to foreign debt, under Mr Howard's period as Treasurer foreign debt increased at a rate of 35 per cent per annum. If that rate of growth of GDP had continued during the last 12 years, the foreign debt today would be $846 billion&mdash;4 1/2 times greater than it is today. As a percentage of GDP, it would be 186 per cent of GDP compared to less than 40 per cent today. This shows what improvements there have been to economic trends under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this country would be a diabolical shambles if the economic trends of the previous government had continued. It is amazing that the Leader of the Opposition said recently that this government was a total economic failure. There is only one total economic failure in this House and he is sitting right there in the Leader of the Opposition's chair.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a bit of equality in the House! My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It is 12 months since I first raised the issue of your government's complicity in the Victorian City Link project through the provision of tax concessions on infrastructure bonds. You have belatedly weighed into the issue, accusing Jeff Kennett of being uncivilised&mdash;I do not disagree with that&mdash;and of herding and funnelling people into tollways in the interests of his mates. He has responded by asking you to put up or shut up. Can you now confirm that your government will withhold tax concessions for this disastrous project? Furthermore, will you give an unequivocal undertaking to apply the same conditions to the state ALP's equally outrageous freeway widening proposal? Finally, if you are vehemently opposed to tollways, why are you prepared to fund them?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is not funding tollways. Let me just make this clear: the point I made about Mr Kennett is that Mr Kennett has a duty to run a civilised society&mdash;and part of that is not putting chains on railway station toilets, part of that is not privatising the ambulance service, part of that is not closing hospitals that need to be opened for the health and care of the community, part of that is not closing down schools and mental institutions. These are the things that are purely an accountant's view of budgetary responsibilities without any sense of the big picture and without any sense of the obligations to a community which a government takes on upon its election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sabotage is a very good word for it. That is exactly what the coalition has done in the Senate at the behest of the Leader of the Opposition. The extension of Adelaide airport is what South Australians had been wanting and crying out for years for. But just when the dream is about to become a reality, the Leader of the Opposition snatches it away.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Commonwealth's point of view, we are not able to enter into any major contract commitments until the budgetary provisions are secured via the leasing process&mdash;that, after all, is where the money comes from. We undertook to fund the runway extension from the leasing proceeds. That is how we brought this work forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the leasing of the airports has been blocked, the total of $44 million that has been allocated for this project from the leasing proceeds is not available until that legislation goes through the parliament&mdash;until the Senate pass it. There is no hope of that happening, by the look of things, until after the next election. And if John Howard controls the Senate after the next election, it will never go through; just as we will never get a second airport for Sydney because it is funded in exactly the same way.</PARA>

Everybody here, everybody in the press gallery, and anybody throughout Australia who follows politics, knows very well that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not been present at question time for the last four weeks. This is his first appearance in parliament for four weeks. What does he do? He sets out on a deliberate pattern of filibustering the government's way through question time&mdash;of deliberately giving excessively and unnecessarily long answers, thinking that at the end of the day either the opposition will lose interest in moving a censure motion or all those who report the news&mdash;particularly on commercial television at 5 and 6 o'clock&mdash;will think it is too late to cover anything at all to do with a censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another aspect of the lengths to which the government will go to deny accountability before the parliament.

The ultimate democratic institution of Australia is the parliament of Australia, and the House of Representatives, I thought, more than any other place, was, in the eyes of the Labor Party, the great clearing house of public conflict in Australia. The Prime Minister himself has said, `It all ends up here. This is where you've got to stand up and be counted. This is where your mettle is demonstrated.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Prime Minister: when the election comes, Paul, you won't be able to walk out of the great debate. I will eyeball you in both of those debates. If you, like the political coward you are, walk out on those, the Australian people will have a good look at you. The television cameras of the living rooms of Australia are not trained on us at the moment, but they will be trained on that debate. Paul Keating can skulk out of parliament this afternoon, he can run from accountability before the bar of public opinion and he can run away from the fact that he did not have the guts to do to Carmen Lawrence what Gough Whitlam had the guts to do to Rex Connor, what Bob Hawke had the guts to do to John Brown, and what any decent postwar Prime Minister would have had the guts to do to somebody who had been publicly discredited as a public liar not only before the parliament of Western Australia but also before the National Press Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the political coward he is, he hides behind the protections of question time. When he has to face me in a debate, when it is a level political playing field and it is not the lopsided playing field of question time, what does this great, brave, powerful, strong leader of Australian politics do? He wimps out of the House. He runs out of the parliament saying, `Oh, I'll do it on Monday.' I can tell the Prime Minister that we certainly will do it on Monday. I tell you what, we'll do it on Tuesday. Oh, we can't do it on Tuesday because that is his rostered day off. That is right, he has to have a little rest on Tuesday. He also has to have a nice little rest on Wednesday so that he can get his strength up for Thursday to answer a few questions. When there is a censure motion he will run out of the House again. That is what he will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a very good demonstration this afternoon of just how this crowd have become so drunk with power that they don't think anything matters anymore. There comes a time, no matter how clever you might think you are&mdash;no matter if you think you have got the Speaker, the ACTU and a few other people on your side&mdash;when you think you can behave in a manner that shows absolute contempt and indifference to the Australian people. But we are coming to a very important election and one of the things that people are going to do when we come to that election is test the behaviour of the Prime Minister against the things that he promised the Australian people when he became Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember that memorable press conference on the night of 19 December 1991, just after he had knifed Bob. When he had knifed off Bob Hawke, do you know what he said to the Australian people? He looked right down the barrel of the camera, he mustered all of that Sussex Street sincerity&mdash;every last bit of it, because he had Laurie beside him giving him advice&mdash;and he said, `I'm going to do three things. I'm going to deal honestly with the people, I'm going to tell them the truth and I'm going to resist the temptation to gild the lily.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has had an opportunity today, he has had an opportunity ever since the Marks royal commission reported, to live up to those promises, and what has he done? He has stood beside a publicly indicted, lying minister. Nobody has been more comprehensively indicted as a political liar in public life than Carmen Lawrence, without any equivocation at all. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister can read the learned opinions of Garfield Barwick&mdash;that is a turn-up, Paul Keating relying on Garfield Barwick&mdash;and do all of that, but nothing can gainsay the fact that the people who have hung and stitched Carmen Lawrence are her own former Labor mates. There was no conspiracy between Richard Court and Jim McGinty and Ian Taylor and Eric Ripper and John Kobelke and Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs and Judith Watson and all the other people, totalling 14. Carmen Lawrence was destroyed at the hands of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new thing we have learnt today is that Paul Keating, the Prime Minister, knew all along that Carmen Lawrence was lying. He admitted it today. He admitted today that Jim McGinty had told him months ago, before the royal commission was set up, that she was wrong and that everybody else who was present was going to give testimony to that effect. What did he then do? Firstly, he concealed that knowledge from the Australian public. Maybe they had the meeting at Kirribilli House; they probably did. He concealed the information from the Australian public. Then, with the knowledge that she was wrong, 14 to 15, he set about traducing the reputation of Kenneth Marks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also since the royal commission finding has come out the Prime Minister has failed to rise to the standard required of him, required of the Prime Minister of this country, and have the courage to get rid of somebody whose public reputation has rightfully been destroyed. For the reasons we explained the other day, if the minister had come clean at the beginning she would not now be in the predicament she is. It is an example of the standards that he has failed to set. Those standards will be judged by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to Monday, when he might have the guts to come in here and have a debate on these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to second the motion and point out to the House that this is the moment, at this stage of the parliamentary sitting week, when the House should put aside all other business to discuss the censure motion laid down by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). Why? Because at the bar of the parliament no-one is above that, not the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and not even the former member for Canberra. Remember Ros Kelly? The Prime Minister had to twist and turn and defend and twist and turn and defend; yet, at the end of the day, there was no choice for the member for Canberra. She had to resign. She was ultimately pushed, shoved, resigned, sacked out of that portfolio because she had failed in her duties to the parliament, failed in her duties and responsibilities as a minister of the Crown, failed with regard to the conduct of her portfolio. She was held accountable to this parliament in a way which I cheerfully remind this government this day, this moment. They might like to reflect on the fact as they go into this weekend interruption to the sittings and contemplate all that they might try to produce in defence of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not only the member for Canberra. It was under the prime ministership of Mr Keating that none other than the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Alan Griffiths, likewise took action on a particular Sunday to resign because he recognised that there were matters to be investigated. He recognised that it was the proper course of action. He recognised the due ethic which should apply in a parliamentary sense. So it was that he fell on his sword and departed his ministerial portfolio under the prime ministership of Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is very clear cut: there is no more serious and important motion to be put before the House than that of censure. Suspension and censure should take priority and should be taken on by the government right now, this Thursday, at 4.40 p.m., even after an extensive and extended question time. It goes to the issue of the integrity of the Minister for Human Services and Health. As the Leader of the Opposition has correctly said, the evidence that flowed from eight former ministers and from senior staffers was not the product of members of the Liberal or National parties, nor was it the product of liaison, consultation, request or approach in any other way from anybody on this side of politics. It was the cold-hearted action, on reflection, of each of the individuals involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I salute one in particular of those individuals. I salute again today Carmel Lawrence's deputy in the Western Australian state parliament, Ian Taylor. That deputy had to wrestle with his conscience and with his political mates. He holds the difficult seat of Kalgoorlie. He came down to Perth and decided, at the end of the day, that he would put his hand up and give evidence that the recollections of the Minister for Human Services and Health were wrong. I know that Ian Taylor is in political opposition to me. I do not know him well. On flights to Perth and back you end up sitting next to a wide range of people and on one occasion I was seated next to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say that I have a great deal of respect for Ian Taylor, who stood up of his own volition, who gave evidence to the royal commission and who proved beyond any conceivable doubt that the Minister for Human Services and Health constructed a situation to get herself off the hook with regard to some travel allowance imprest claim of the sort that tends to dominate the Western Australian state parliament from time to time. Everybody has paid the price except for Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>

You will rue the day you permitted that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go on to deal with what you regard as matters of substance, what you have had to say in your statement. You were offered a censure debate by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has other things to do during the course of this day, as though you would not welcome an opportunity to debate this at a more reasonable hour than 4.45 on a Thursday afternoon. You are offered a decent slot on Monday to conduct that censure debate, but you have turned it down. You decided to proceed anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was not running away from the debate. He informed you that you could have your debate on Monday. You would have had the debate on Monday at a more reasonable hour and with more decent public attention. `Oh, no,' you said, `We don't want that. We want it right now, thank you very much.' This is as much of it as you are getting as far as we are concerned. You had your opportunity. The Prime Minister made that offer to you, and you turned him down flat. Anyone would think it would be better to speak at a reasonable hour on Monday than at 4.45 on a Thursday afternoon. You need your head read in terms of parliamentary tactics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the basis of the censure motion that you want to move? It is about the failure of the Prime Minister to disclose that he had been told by the Western Australian Labor leader that his minister's claims were wrong. The answer was obviously pointed out to you during question time. You clearly are not flexible, because I thought that you would have changed the terms of reference of your censure motion lickety-split after you were presented with the answer by the Prime Minister at that time. He made amply clear that he had been informed by the minister at the time that there were differing recollections of that set of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You apparently have a problem with differing recollections. You did not have much of a problem with differing recollections when Graham Kierath told you that, as far as he was concerned, you supported him right down the line on this second tranche of industrial reforms. `I have a differing recollection of that,' you said, `I didn't say that to Mr Kierath.' Which is it: is Mr Kierath a liar, are you a liar, or do you have differing recollections?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was informed by the minister at the time that there were differing recollections. If he had not been informed by the Minister for Human Services and Health, all he needed to do was pick up a newspaper at the time to find a few differing recollections of those events around the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there have been a few other differing recollections revealed today which I thought you might have looked at. They were again revealed by the Prime Minister in question time. I thought you would have looked at them before you extended the ultimate arm of credibility to this royal commission. What you have had revealed to you today were persistent denials by the Western Australian Premier&mdash;it was a level of denial which caused questions not to be able to be asked before the royal commission about the briefing he may have received from his staff&mdash;that have now been overturned. Obviously it goes to the very credibility of the operations of the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recollect the surprise when one contrary witness after another&mdash;there was very little capacity to test them&mdash;was lined up against Carmen Lawrence in that royal commission. A few people scratched their heads and said, `Hang on a tick. Is there a bit of due process here and connivance between the royal commission and any part of the political process in Western Australia?' Isn't that a bit of a surprise? At the time, it was said that there was no connivance between the Premier's office and the political process and the royal commission. It was a totally independent body standing alone uninterfered with and unsullied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Premier of Western Australia had to face up to his differing recollections. Previously, he had allowed slide the view that of course he had had nothing to do with advising the royal commission. His political office stood pure in it. Any communications had been purely about administrative matters and purely between officials of the relevant department and the royal commission. He says that political office was not involved. His chief political operator, Richard Elliott, made so many phone calls that the commission could not count them. The commission has a bit of a recollection problem. It cannot even recall the number of phone calls between the political office of the Premier and the royal commission, and therefore cannot detail them. Bully for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can have that log rolling operation in Western Australia, but do not expect us to respect it. Do not expect us to respect it when that lying, misleading and deceit from the Premier of Western Australia is the basis on which this royal commission was set up. When very relevant questioning on that point was issued by counsel for Dr Lawrence, it was shut off. There was not one word about it. They could not proceed down that road. This situation in relation to the affairs of the Eastons and the Campbells had been like a cricket match as far as the opposition was concerned. It was two or three years before the matters were finally raised by somebody on the Labor side of the House. It was a cricket match of one innings, in which the Liberals and the Nationals were doing all the bowling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one question after another they were getting into the guts of the issues between them. Not one word of that was permitted in the royal commission. For even the royal commissioner that was too much. Even the royal commissioner had to come out and say, `A reasonable person looking at my terms of reference might find that a bit inadequate,' but it was not included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obviously not included because had it been included it would have allowed a far broader questioning of Richard Court and his involvement in these matters and a far broader questioning of the activity of the new government in Western Australia and of its activities in regard to that before that royal commission. We are supposed to respect this royal commission. We are supposed to say this royal commission is the bee's knees when it comes to passing judgment on a member of the front bench here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a royal commission, inadequate in its terms of reference, log rolled. The log roll is concealed, and now we have revealed the extent to which there has been connivance between counsel for the royal commission and the political end of the Premier's office&mdash;conniving so extensive that we cannot detail the number of phone calls. Yet we are invited to all throw up our hands in joy at this process and give it respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion continues: `his industrial relations incompetence which enabled a disastrous strike to go ahead'. As I remember the events of last week, they seemed to go something like this: the two parties clash and are unable to converse with each other, waterfront dispute starts up, coal dispute is threatened, Prime Minister intervenes, the two parties talk for the first time, they make progress, talks fall apart, Prime Minister intervenes again and requests industrial relations minister to get the matter before the commission. The two parties then go before the commission, which they refused to do before, the case is put before the commission, the national strike is called off and the resolution is put forward. That is as I remember the progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is supposed to be industrial relations incompetence by the Prime Minister. Some incompetence! Had you been in office that strike would still be rocking on with no solution except to gaol people, but it is over and a bit of justice is being meted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion also states that the Prime Minister has an inability to insist on the truth from those around him. I could go into detail on that through the opposition. All I need to do is refer to Senator Macdonald's famous quote, the first instance of a detailed revelation of Liberal Party internal planning. What is it? Liberal Party internal planning reveals it has a whole set of propositions up. It says it will make much of them for all these public works but will never do any of them. It will mislead the Australian people on its intent, and John Howard says, `I don't have a liar behind me.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in the Marks royal commission in Perth we heard of the untruthful behaviour of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) arising from the so-called Penny Easton affair. This week we heard debate in this place on government proposals to fund the minister's substantial legal fees associated with that royal commission. Only in the last hour we have debated the minister's credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, I have to report another dimension to that lack of credibility of the minister involving a recent case of medical treatment of one of my constituents. It is clear to my constituent that Dr Lawrence's untruthful behaviour revealed by Commissioner Marks is now matched by the ideologically driven attitude of her office and her department to the health problems of ordinary battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistently, in debates in this place and in her public utterances, Dr Lawrence has set out to play down the merits of private health insurance, to beat up the infallibility of Medicare and the public health system, to put many doctors in a collective category as excessive chargers of their services or to bag the avaricious nature of the AMA. Dr Lawrence's office in particular has a persistence for politics over portfolio, and my constituent's problem proves the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I was faced both with a practical example of some of the serious shortcomings of Dr Lawrence's present health system and with the political emphasis of Dr Lawrence's office and her department rather than with their genuine interest in the health care problems of a distraught local housewife threatening suicide. The lady involved, who was diagnosed with degenerative spondylosis over five years ago, has been forced to pay nearly $90,000 out of her own pocket in that time to meet hospital and medical bills, despite medical insurance. More expense is likely, possibly in the order of $15,000 of personal liability, as a result of further operations in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To meet these financial commitments, she and her average income police sergeant husband have been forced into bank loans and further financial stress. Personal family relationships are at a breaking point. The extent of their financial liability results from a combination of factors, such as the unrealistic schedule fees determined by the government under Medicare arrangements, the increasing gap between Medicare refunds and consultancy or service charges, the outpatient inadequacies of Medicare arrangements and the unfortunate tendency of some doctors to charge substantially above the schedule fee or AMA recommended level&mdash;although in this case I have to say that the specialist concerned is continuing to carry the lady's large debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is the negative attitude of Dr Lawrence's office and her department to the specific problem that has caused deep despair to this couple, who came to see me only last week. When my electorate office phoned Dr Lawrence's Canberra office early last week seeking urgent advice in light of the lady's suicidal tendencies, her staff were just not interested. `If she is a private patient, we can't help,' was the general reaction, and they referred my office to the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the department conceded that it was one of the worst cases brought to their attention, the blame was shifted quickly to ideological criticisms of private health insurance and the lack of Commonwealth power over doctors' fees. In a nutshell, the simplistic, unhelpful attitude was: the lady would have been better off as a public patient where the problem would not have arisen. This is patently untrue, as Queensland public hospital queues will attest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very disturbing additional dimension to the problem was a suggestion that the couple might separate so that the lady could claim the invalid pension. So much for the government's infallible Medicare arrangements and its unequivocal social awareness. Clearly, there is a big difference between the Commonwealth paying the legal fees of Dr Lawrence and a genuine desire to assist this desperate lady&mdash;and many like her&mdash;under Medicare arrangements which remain inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is for the lady's welfare, as indeed it is incumbent on Dr Lawrence to be just as concerned. The lady places much of the blame squarely at the feet of Dr Lawrence, who continues to demonstrate her unsuitability for ministerial responsibility. A letter to the editor in yesterday's Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> put the Lawrence debacle in a nutshell when it said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some 12 to 14 months ago, I, along with a number of my colleagues from Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales, joined together to form the fair share task force to fight for an increase in tertiary places for Queensland. It is well known to this House that Queensland had not been getting its fair allocation of tertiary places and that universities in western Sydney and in Western Australia had also not been getting their fair share of places allocated by federal funds. So we formed the fair share task force and took our case to the federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was very responsive to our case and understood that there was a need for a redress in the balance of distribution of places. He undertook to do what he could in the budget to try to find the extra funding for those tertiary places. We spent some months working with the minister to try to find ways in which we could find those additional tertiary places. It was a great joy to Queenslanders, particularly those Queensland families that have young people leaving year 12 this year, to find that in the budget the federal government was able to find measures to achieve additional funding so that Queensland could get an additional 4,200 extra places. What that extra allocation meant was that Queensland students were going to get their fair share and that young Queenslanders were going to get the opportunity to go to university and to achieve their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It now appears that all of that has been placed in jeopardy. Liberal and National Party members and senators have worked to try to stop this from happening. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that I will be going out and about throughout my electorate and the state of Queensland telling the young people that the members of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland do not want them to have a place in higher education. Those members have worked in this parliament to stop young people from going to university. This is their commitment to higher education. This is how they demonstrate their commitment to young people. They are trying to starve the universities of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not let this issue die. The Queensland opposition members&mdash;the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the member for Ryan (Mr Moore), the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford)&mdash;can all go back to their constituencies and explain to the year 12 students why they have starved the universities in Queensland of funds and stopped the young people from going to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You explain to the year 12 students who have just sat for their exams and are now waiting for their OP scores to be published and for university placements to be offered why they will not be offered a place at one of the great universities in Queensland. Explain to them that you were so mean-spirited that you would not allow the funds to be allocated in the budget. You will be made to account for your actions in this place and in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that I will make sure that every year 12 student throughout Queensland is made aware of the actions of the members of the Liberal Party and the National Party in moving to prevent funds being allocated so that 4,200 extra young people can be placed in universities, giving them the opportunity to fulfil their potential. Liberal Party and National Party senators should hang their heads in shame. I will be making sure that the Liberal Senate team going into the 1996 election&mdash;Senator Herron and Senator Ian Macdonald&mdash;are made to account for the way in which they have acted in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can members of the Liberal and National parties dare to look year 12 students in their electorates in the face? I went and visited every year 12 student in my electorate and I committed myself to work to get extra university places. I will continue to do that. Members of the Liberal and National parties have no credibility and no integrity when it comes to caring about young people and families when they are willing to act in such a disgraceful and destructive way. They have cut funds that will provide for extra university places in Queensland. It is an absolute shame. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the adjournment debate and to indicate to the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that if he believes that he has a monopoly on caring and integrity perhaps he might care to join me in making representations to the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) to ensure that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill is passed through the Senate and is no longer listed so far down the Senate legislation list that there is a real risk that it will not be debated. The bill has already been through this House. There is a real risk that the bill will not be processed before Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will deny a major industry in my electorate the opportunity to effectively retail and make available to Australians the therapeutic goods that it manufactures. The company affected is the Brauer company which has a processing factory in the Barossa Valley. The Brauer family came to the Barossa Valley as part of the German settlement movement in the 1840s. The Brauers were associated with pharmaceutical goods production and processing in the Barossa Valley. In 1972 they went into production of their own homeopathic medicines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brauers have been at the cutting edge of homoeopathic research and the retailing of homoeopathic goods across Australia and, in 1987, were the recipients of the Lady Cilento Award for the production of homoeopathic medicines. They are now in the situation of having several new products that they wish to list, that they have indicated they have been processing and that they wish to market. The products have met all the various standards that are required by Australian legislation. The fact that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill is still waiting, unprocessed through the Senate, means that they cannot list these new products on the marketplace. As a result, their managing director, Mr Mark Wuttke, tells me that since 1 July this year he has had to place four full-time people out of the work force, two other jobs are currently at risk and they estimate they have lost over $150,000 in sales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to speak about one of the most successful initiatives ever initiated by any government in Australia. I refer to the national aged care system that operates in this country, whereby licensed beds for nursing homes and hostels are issued by the Department of Human Services and Health and those positions are subsidised. By the issue of this seeding capital and the guarantee that there will be a bed available for a frail aged person, if this is correctly managed it can become a major business, a major employer, in many country towns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little over a week ago I had the pleasure of attending the annual general meeting of the Dungog Nursing Home. This is a 20-bed hostel and a 20-bed nursing home complex. It was built in 1989. At that time I was serving as a councillor on Dungog Shire Council. It was built with the aid of a $1 million grant from the federal government. Today that nursing home-hostel not only provides top quality accommodation for 40 frail aged people but also provides 38 jobs in a small rural town. It has accumulated property and has assets worth $3 million. The phenomenal success that this organisation has enjoyed has resulted in its acquiring land and building eight self-care units, with another four to be constructed. As a result of being given $1 million five years ago, this organisation now has three tiers of aged care available and employs people at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases such as this I generally do not single out individuals but in this case I am sure the committee will not object to my mentioning their executive: Mr Ray Nielson, chairman; Councillor Anne MacDonald, secretary; and Mr Reg Howard, treasurer. These people have been totally dedicated to seeing their dream come to fruition. It is with great respect that I mention them. In five short years I am sure the whole committee believe that their plan has succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nursing home has become a focal point of the whole community. Head of nursing Amanda Lydon, the deputy director of the hostel Susan Adphaloosy, the clerical person Carol Passenow and Sister Margaret Emry are just some of the people who work behind the scenes to continue the care of the aged. Assisting the full-time staff are people enrolled in the local skillshare projects. I know that there is an opinion held by some members opposite that these training programs often only play at training and do not lead to a real job, but in this case they are definitely providing a major service to members of the community and they will lead to jobs because this is an expanding industry. Some of these staff provide tuition to these students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nursing home has also been involved in many other community projects such as Greening Australia in conjunction with the LEAP project involving school children and the long-term unemployed. This pattern of aged care is repeated in many towns. I am sure that representatives here from rural and regional electorates know exactly what I am talking about because it is repeated there and it is very successful. In the electorate of Paterson we have outstanding community support in towns such as Gloucester, Stroud, Bulahdelah, Hawkesnest, Maitland, Tenilba Bay and Nelson Bay. All of these places have nursing homes, hostels or both. Each is subsidised by the federal government, each providing quality accommodation and care and, more importantly, creating jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the House that every opportunity I get I remind the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) what a great system this is. In an ageing population I believe it is vital that we dedicate more resources to this system of care. The subsidy we give is compensated by the jobs that are created and these are often in towns where traditional industries have disappeared and where the opportunity for job creation is minimal. I would urge all members of this House to support this great system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the adjournment debate tonight to voice my concern for the 4,500 newsagents of Australia who I believe are subject to attack because of, perhaps, an aberration in the application of our new competition policy. I believe that while we must have competition&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;it has to be leavened with a degree of sanity. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is the old Trade Practices Commission&mdash;still chaired by professor Allan Fels, by the way&mdash;appears to be too focused on the theory of competition rather than the reality. I do not think they can see the wood for the trees. While they obviously want to get a better deal for consumers&mdash;and so does everybody in this place&mdash;we have to be concerned about the fabric and the structure which provide that service to the consumers. That fabric and structure involves the 4,500 newsagents operating around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be concerned about what might occur, which would be the removal of the delivery monopoly and other benefits enjoyed by newsagents. Instead of bringing about a better system for the sale and delivery of newspapers and magazines, removing, revoking or modifying the current authorisations could leave both newsagencies and public arrangements in disarray. The Trade Practices Commission, I believe, needs to finalise its very longwinded decisions as quickly as possible. It is worth noting that the Fraser government was quoted in the newspapers as saying at that time, which was in 1978-79, that the widespread availability of newspapers and magazines and the low cost home delivery service were the principal public benefit. The point I want to make is that there are public benefits from the current newsagent system. It has certainly worked very successfully in the distribution of newspapers throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a very clear perspective on where it stands on this issue. The coalition and I support the continuation of the current system of distribution for newspapers and magazines, with one accredited newsagent for a particular territory. The fact is that the newsagents' network in this country, together with the 25,000 subagents, provides an excellent public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people are as concerned as the coalition and I about preserving small business, we should realise that putting the products at newsagents increasingly into the Woolworths and the Coles is not going to help small business; it is going to destroy it. It is certainly going to provide a situation where individual small businesses will be pushed out. I can even envisage a situation where there is a major shopping complex with perhaps even 80 shops and if things go the way they seem to be going&mdash;it is drawing a long bow&mdash;you could end up with Coles at one end, Woolworths at the other end and absolutely nothing in between. I do not think that is appropriate; it is total madness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's 4,500 newsagents are located in every significant shopping area right across Australia. They provide face to face service to more than one million customers every day. They represent one of the last bastions of major successful family business enterprise and employ in excess of 20,000 staff. A great many of them are youngsters. If we are concerned about youth unemployment we should remember that businesses like newsagencies do employ young Australians. That, to me, is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sector turns over more than $3 billion annually and holds the investment hopes of thousands of Australians who have their life savings in their businesses. If they are to be destroyed, I believe there must be compensation. If the authorisation does have to change, there must be compensation for loss of income and the purchase of goodwill to be included in that authorisation. I support the need for compensation and the purchase of the goodwill. If the axe falls on newsagencies, they should not be treated unfairly but I believe the axe should not fall and the system should be left as it is. It works well and it is for the public benefit. It benefits the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I had a meeting with the Independent Retirees in Tasmania&mdash;a group that has been at some pains to explain that they have been disadvantaged under government policy. I took the time to go through what this government has done for all pensioners and, specifically, some of the changes for independent retirees that were made after the strategic review into pensioners' income and the assets test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have agreed to extend deeming to financial investments, which will simplify the way in which income from investments is assessed by the Department of Social Security. We have also abolished the separate fringe benefits income and assets test, enabling all pensioners to receive Commonwealth and state concessions and allowing more people to hold a pension card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A seniors health card has been introduced offering a range of health related concessions and there has been an easing of the assets test on pensions. There has been a major expansion of financial information services to help older people. There has also been a move to simplify the paperwork involved in applying for a seniors health card and other initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been very conscious of the problems of independent retirees and we wish to ensure that there is equity between those who are on a government pension and those who are financing their own. In this term we have attempted to rectify some of the injustices&mdash;and I think we have succeeded in what has occurred so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that I find is still not sufficiently emphasised in policy development is that people who retire are not necessarily disabled, sick or incapable of contributing to their community. On the contrary, many people retire because they wish to pursue their own interests, develop long held dreams and help their families. Once they have achieved some of their ambitions, they cast around for other tasks that take their fancy. Their skills and expertise are out there, waiting to be tapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a new approach to the development of policies for older Australians based on the recognition of the important roles played by older people in our community, in family life, in the provision of services and in promoting harmony between generations. I would like to see an integrated strategy that will pull together all the different policy areas, such as income support, housing, community services, home care and tax regimes so that we can meet the changing needs of our older people and recognise their skills. </PARA>

He was regarded as a man with a sense of fair play and, as far as policemen go, he was very well accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem arose in Kalgoorlie over an incident where speed radar traps were set outside a hotel. There were allegations that he was unhappy with the hotel because of the treatment that his daughter had received there. This was deemed to be vindictive. He was charged by the internal investigation branch of the police service. They made it a criminal charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is this: even if he did this vindictively&mdash;it has been denied that he did&mdash;it is not an offence. He was absolutely entitled to do that. So it was not a criminal offence. It appears that the internal investigation branch harassed the hotel into making a complaint. It did not want to make a complaint; it was harassed into making one. It went to a preliminary hearing in court and was thrown out. It was then ex officio indicted by the DPP, and it went to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first occasion, he was certainly incompetently represented, and the DPP got a conviction. The magistrate sentenced him to two years in gaol, which was certainly very excessive. He appealed that decision, the appeal was upheld and a new trial was ordered. At the new trial, properly represented, it was thrown out in record time. The man was acquitted as he should have been. He should never have been charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You then have to look at the affairs of Sergeant Waghorn and Detective Christmass, two officers in the drug squad. They were sent to interview a person who had actually sent Homebake to someone in Carnarvon who had died as a result. This person was interviewed, his premises were searched and he was found to have in his possession the manufacturing equipment. He was clearly in some sort of trouble. This man made a statement and it went to court. In court, the man, Mr O'Halloran, defended himself. It was only natural that he should seek every avenue open to him, and I certainly do not deny him that right. He threw doubt on the validity of the signatures that were on every page of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in evidence that Sergeant Waghorn had said to him on several occasions, `Will you sign this again?' This matter was raised in the court and it was decided by the magistrate that there had to be some study into whether it was his signature or not. The experts simply could not agree so the guy was acquitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, Christmass and Waghorn were once again ex officio indicted by the DPP. They went to the preliminary hearing and it was thrown out. So, once again, they were ex officio indicted and it went to court. This dragged on for two years. When it went to court, O'Halloran, who by this time had got himself off heroin, decided that the honourable thing to do would be to go forward and say, `It was my signature. In all probability I did sign it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP knew this all the time yet it refused to call him as a witness. Had he been called as a witness there would have been no case. The DPP is duty bound to call all the evidence, and it failed to do this. It was prepared to put these two police officers through two years of sheer hell. It cost the families of the officers dearly. In my view, those two officers were doing a great job for the community and were unmercifully harassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common factors in all this harassment are the Director of Public Prosecutions, John McKechnie, and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Les Ayton. They are the common factors through all these things, and this is just a handful of matters. I have literally many cases here where the same sort of thing has applied. There has to be some real look at what is happening to justice in Western Australia. If there was ever a need for an inquiry, it is for an additional inquiry into the administration of justice in Western Australia. Such an inquiry is long overdue. If we are to return some dignity and some sense of cohesion and purpose to the police force, we must have an inquiry. Many people in the police force want it.

I also said that there was a proposed $216 million expansion at the Southland shopping centre. It would involve massive planning requirements which had not been taken into consideration throughout this process, which was a money grab for market stalls on the side. I also said in my speech that the Victorian Minister for Planning, Mr Rob MacLellan, had threatened to cut road services to the Moorabbin airport&mdash;that is nothing light, is it?&mdash;if the airport proceeded to hold markets on the site.

<PARA>The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 proposes amendments in the light of a recent court decision that has jeopardised the viability of the voluntary administration scheme under part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, which commenced operation in June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5.3A of the Corporations Law provides a regime for companies to enter voluntary administration as an alternative to liquidation. It is an extremely popular method of dealing with companies in financial difficulty. The scheme allows a company in financial difficulty to enter into a deed of company arrangement with its creditors. This enables the company to continue trading for a period with a view to producing some return for creditors, rather than being wound up immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantage of taking this course from a creditor's perspective is that if the company is allowed to continue operating its business, there is a likelihood that a better return to creditors will be obtained than if the company is liquidated immediately. The mechanism also serves to avoid the costs and delays often associated with liquidations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics published by the Australian Securities Commission and industry bodies show that the voluntary administration scheme is an increasingly popular means of dealing with corporate financial difficulties. In a significant proportion of cases, companies enter into deeds of company arrangements with their creditors, rather than proceeding directly to winding up, in an effort to save the company or at least its business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, after a period of trading under a deed of company arrangement, it will become apparent that the continued trading of the company will not be successful. In that case, the creditors are permitted to have the company liquidated immediately. The Corporations Law provides for an automatic transition to a creditor's voluntary winding up in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June this year, His Honour Mr Justice Cohen of the New South Wales Supreme<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Court held&mdash;in Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 874; (1995) 17 ACSR 295&mdash;that where persons deal with a company under a deed of company arrangement and that company moves into liquidation, those persons may not make a claim in the winding up for any outstanding liabilities of the company in relation to those dealings. His Honour remarked that this is not a result that could have been intended by the legislature and therefore called for urgent legislative amendment. In the wake of the Crawford House decision, there have been calls for urgent legislative amendment, particularly from practitioners in the insolvency area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1995 is designed to overcome a recent decision of Cohen J in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Re Crawford House Pty Ltd. The decision highlights an unintended anomaly with the voluntary administration provisions of the Corporations Law and adversely affects creditors who deal with a company controlled by directors as distinct from an administrator while under voluntary administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the background to these administrative provisions, the provisions of the Corporations Law entitled `Administration of a company's affairs with the view to executing a deed of company arrangement', part 5.3A, commenced operation on 23 June 1993. The objects of this part are to provide for an insolvent company to be administered so that the chances of the company continuing in existence are maximised; and, if it is not possible for the company to continue, for a better return to creditors than would result from an immediate winding up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before this part, generally speaking, the only remedy available to a company in trouble was to have it wound up. Other options of a scheme of arrangement or official management, requiring 100 per cent return, were cumbersome and costly. There was, therefore, very little prospect of a potentially viable business being able to continue in existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporate Law Reform Act 1992 inserted a new part 53.A, a scheme for voluntary administration of a company which is in financial difficulties. Through the agreement with creditors, the company can continue to trade under external supervision of the administrator in the hope that it might ultimately trade out of its difficulties. The means by which this is done is under a deed of company arrangement. This has obvious advantages for the directors, shareholders and creditors of the company. It also means that the company can continue to employ people and contribute to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debts incurred during the operation of the arrangement were thought to be ranked in priority over other unsecured creditors in any winding up. The purpose was to provide an incentive or reward for dealing with a company in difficulties and give it a second chance. Under deeds of company arrangement, it is possible for the creditors to resolve that the administrator not be involved in the carrying out of the business, but the directors of the company be responsible. It was incorrectly assumed by many that the priority in ranking would attract to the debts irrespective of whether the administrator or the directors were carrying out the day-to-day running of the company. However, the Crawford House case held that, due to technical deficiency in the legislation, if debts were incurred by the directors of the company in lieu of the administrator, the debts not only do not rank at all but are not provable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Crawford House case, this bill before the parliament is needed to overcome this decision. On 13 December 1993, Mr Dean Willcocks was appointed administrator of Crawford House Press Pty Ltd. At that time, the company had creditors whose debts totalled $1,344,299. By 23 December 1993, a creditors meeting had resolved that the administrator should cease to be involved in the actual carrying on of the business of the company, but that the administrator should have certain powers should the company default on the arrangement. It was assumed that the company would continue in business and that the company and not the administrator would incur such debts as were necessary for carrying on the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company attempted to trade out of its difficulties, but this was not successful and, in June 1994, creditors decided that the arrangement should be terminated and the company should be wound up. The administrator was appointed liquidator. In that period of time, the company incurred additional debts of $38,118. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crawford House decision held that, because the debts were not incurred by the administrator, not only did they not get priority but they were not provable in any subsequent winding up. Mr Justice Cohen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this legislation is that creditors of the administrator received priority in respect of debts incurred by him. Where, as in the present case, and in many similar instances, the deed of company arrangement provides that the administrator is not to be involved in the carrying on of the business but that this will in effect be under the control of the directors, then any trading debts incurred during the period of the term of the deed will be those of the company and not those of the administrator.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[These debts] were incurred after the commencement of administration and the result is that they appear to have been omitted from any category of debts recoverable in a subsequent winding up because of what appears to be a gap in the legislation. It is not satisfactory that the position should be left as it is and it requires urgent legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the issue of priority of debt incurred by administrators, under the existing legislation, debts incurred prior to a company entering into a deed of company arrangement can be proved in a winding up. However, if a company subsequently enters into a deed of arrangement, then debts incurred by the administrator during the period after the deed has been entered into take priority in any subsequent litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of priority and provability of directors' debts, if under a deed the directors of a company are responsible for running the day-to-day affairs of the company then the decision of Crawford House means that not only are debts incurred by the directors without priority but they are not even admissible to prove in any subsequent winding-up. This is because section 513B of the Corporations Law provides a number of alternative dates for the commencement of a winding-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where, as in the case of Crawford House, the company was under a deed of company arrangement immediately prior to the resolution to wind up the company being passed, the winding-up is taken to have commenced on the day the deed began. The winding up therefore refers back to this earlier date. This earlier date is defined as the relevant date in the Corporations Law. Debts are provable if incurred before the relevant date. For the purposes of admissibility of debts, the date of the deed of company arrangement and the date of liquidation are no longer different dates. The date of liquidation becomes the date the deed of company arrangement was entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to an exception for administrators, there is, however, a mechanism whereby debts incurred between the commencement of the administration and the winding-up can be proved and have priority. This mechanism is granted to the administrator. After all, the legislation makes the date of liquidation relate back to the date the administration commenced. Any dates incurred after the liquidation cannot be proved. This means debts incurred in an administration would ordinarily, without an exception being provided, neither have priority nor be provable, because they would have been debts incurred after the date of liquidation. Section 556 provides a suitable mechanism by spelling out that a relevant authority has priority during that time, and defining the administration as a relevant authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some concerns by interest groups. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia has indicated that many solicitors have advised their clients to refuse to supply companies that are subject to an arrangement except on a cash on delivery basis. The Law Council and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia have urged amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing to amend section 553 of the Corporations Law, which deals with debts or claims that are provable in a winding-up. Its amendment seeks to ensure that all such debts or claims incurred by the directors of the company will be provable. It is important to recognise that the government's bill will not give priority to debts incurred by the directors of the company under a deed of company arrangement. The government's proposal therefore will not reward those creditors who deal with directors of a company rather than an administrator, under a deed of company arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen is that, even though the debts are incurred after the relevant date, the time for which such new creditors will be able to prove will be extended to the date of termination of the deed of company arrangement. It is simply seeking to ensure that, where the existing creditors choose to allow the directors to run the company, the debts incurred while under the arrangement are at least provable. They are not seeking to give those debts any priority over other existing unsecured creditors. It treats them as normal unsecured creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will have the effect of discouraging creditors from dealing with a company under an arrangement if the directors are in charge. If the directors are in charge, all unsecured creditors will rank together; but if the administrator is in charge debts incurred under a deed will rank in priority. This is a clear policy decision to create an incentive for existing creditors to allow a costly administrator to take charge of the daily affairs of the company. It creates a disincentive for the creditors, who are after all the ones who have the most to lose, to choose the less expensive option of allowing the directors to run the day-to-day affairs of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a retrospective provision. This is in order to validate the actions of any liquidator who has recognised a debt which, if challenged on the basis of the Crawford House decision, should have been rejected by the liquidator. This retrospectivity will date back to the commencement on 23 June 1993 of the voluntary administration scheme introduced by the Corporate Law Reform Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the problem clearly needs to be fixed. However, we believe there may be a better way to deal with it. Since it is the creditors who have the most to lose, it seems appropriate to allow them to make a choice as to whether an administrator or directors should have the day-to-day running of the company under an arrangement. There should not be an incentive to choose an administrator over the directors. In order to give them an unfettered choice, there should be a reward for all creditors dealing with a company in difficulties and giving it a second chance, irrespective of whether the directors or the administrator have the day-to-day running of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriate reward is that the debts will rank in priority over other unsecured creditors. In order to achieve that end, we will move an amendment to ensure that the debts incurred by directors have the same priority ranking as those incurred by an administrator. Our amendments will define directors in such a situation as a relevant authority, like an administrator, for the purposes of these sections. All debts, irrespective of whether the administrator or the directors had the day-to-day running of the company, would then get priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition feels this is a better way to resolve the decision in the Crawford House case. Of course, if our amendment is unsuccessful then we will support the bill. However, when we deal with the matter in detail I will move the amendment that has been circulated in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is not surprising. In order to speak to the amendment let me go into a little background. The Corporations Law Amendment Bill has been brought on with some urgency, which is understandable because of what was described by Justice Cohen in the New South Wales Supreme Court decision of Re Crawford House Pty Ltd as a loophole. That decision was handed down as recently as 13 June 1995 and His Honour said of the loophole that it is not satisfactory that the position should be left as it is and that it requires urgent legislative amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to understand what His Honour was concerned about, a little further background may assist. An administrator was appointed to the company, Crawford House Pty Ltd, in December 1993. At a creditors meeting it was resolved that the company should enter into a deed of company arrangement in the form approved by the creditors. A clause of the deed provided that the administrator should cease carrying on the company's business and instead the company itself was to continue in business and pay money to the administrator for the purpose of his making distributions in a prescribed manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company continued to trade, but not very successfully. A meeting of creditors was held in June 1994 at which it was resolved to terminate the deed of company arrangement and wind up the company. During the period from December 1993 to June 1994 when the company was trading under the deed of company arrangement, additional debts of over $38,000 were incurred. The liquidator sought the court's directions as to whether the creditors in question were unsecured creditors, creditors as part of the costs of the winding up or not creditors at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant provisions of the Corporations Law were quite new. They were introduced by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992, which commenced in part in February and in part in June of 1993. The law provides that where&mdash;immediately before a voluntary winding-up resolution is passed&mdash;a company is under administration, the winding-up is taken to have commenced on the day on which the administration began. In the Crawford House case, the date of commencement of the winding-up was the day when the administration began: namely, a date in December 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem arises, because the Corporations Law also provides that the debts which are admissible to prove against a company that is winding up are all debts the circumstances giving rise to which occurred before the day on which the winding-up began. This drew from Justice Cohen the following conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result is that when there has been an administration of the company, whether followed by a deed of company arrangement or not, provable debts are those where the circumstances giving rise to them occurred before the date of commencement of the administration.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the company traded during the period of administration under the control of the directors, any trading debts incurred during the period of the term of the deed will be those of the company and not of the administrator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice Cohen concluded, in regard to those debts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were incurred after the commencement of administration and the result is that they appear to have been omitted from any category of debts recoverable in a subsequent winding up because of what appears to be a gap in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This results in the regrettable situation that there appears to be no right in those who became creditors of the company or whose debts were increased during the period of the operation of the deed, to prove for those debts or increased debts.</PARA>
<PARA>The law provides that the voluntary administration provisions of the Corporations Law serve two purposes. The first is to maximise the chances of the company's continuing in existence. The second, which is really an alternative, is, if it is not possible for the company to continue, to get a better return for the company's creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Crawford House decision, it was thought that debts incurred during the operation of a deed of company arrangement ranked in priority to other unsecured creditors in any winding-up. The reason for this is that such creditors should have an incentive or reward for dealing with the company in difficulties and, in so doing, giving it a second chance. The Crawford House case has made it clear that these creditors do not have any such priority. However, the result is otherwise where the administrator, rather than the directors, is carrying out the day-to-day running of the company. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Trading debts incurred by an administrator will then rank in priority to other unsecured debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that, where the creditors choose to allow the directors to run the company, debts incurred while the deed of company arrangement is in force will be provable in the subsequent winding-up. But the bill does not give those debts any priority over other unsecured debts. The bill proposes to treat those creditors as normal unsecured creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has said, the effect of this is to discourage creditors from dealing with the company under a deed of company arrangement if the directors, rather than an administrator, are in charge. If an administrator is in charge under the deed of company arrangement, the debts incurred during the period of the deed of company arrangement will rank in priority to other unsecured creditors. The effect of this, as the member for Berowra has explained, will clearly provide a disincentive for those creditors considering extending further credit to the company to help it continue to trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the creditors want to ensure that the increase in their debts will be protected by a priority ranking, they will need to appoint an administrator to run the company, rather than allow the directors to control the day-to-day management of the company. The disadvantage of this is that the less expensive option is likely to be having the directors run the company. In order that the creditors have a real choice as to whether they appoint an administrator to run the business or allow the company directors to continue running the business, all trade debts incurred under a deed of company arrangement should have the same priority ranking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end I support the amendment moved by the member for Berowra. The amendment will have the effect of including the directors, along with the administrator, within the definition of `a relevant authority' for the purpose of voluntary administration provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this anomaly in the legislation is rectified, and the bill will do that. There is, I should mention also, retrospective application of the bill. This is in order to validate the actions of a liquidator who has recognised a debt which, according to the Crawford House case, should have been rejected by the liquidator. The retrospectivity will date back to the commencement in June 1993 of the voluntary administration scheme provisions of the Corporations Law. This retrospectivity would be objectionable if someone had arranged their affairs in reliance on the debts not being provable. Such a person or company would be seeking to take advantage of the loophole in the legislation to avoid paying a properly incurred debt. Such a person or company cannot expect the protection of this parliament for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retrospective legislation as a class is invidious, and there are few exceptions. Since the retrospective element of this bill is designed to ensure that a particular group of creditors will have the right to prove for their debts in the winding up of the debtor company, it is difficult to see the disadvantage of that provision. Obviously, the preferable course would be for the government to have got its legislation right the first time round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, as the member for Berowra has pointed out, does not oppose this bill, but is of the view that all debts incurred by a company under a deed of company arrangement should have a priority ranking over the unsecured debts. To that end, I support the amendment moved by the member for Berowra. </PARA>

We have spoken to the attorneys-general, the Law Council of Australia, the Insolvency Practitioners Association, various law societies, bar associations, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. Consequently, the amendment which is being moved by the honourable member for Berowra, I suppose one could say, is the result of the collective wisdom of all of those groups, who see that there is a need to amend the legislation but who believe that the legislation should be improved as a result of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, in the case Re Crawford House Press Pty Ltd there clearly was highlighted an unintended consequence of the legislation which is currently law in this nation. Because of an anomaly in a section of the Corporations Law, the Crawford House Press case held that, if debts are incurred by the directors of a company in lieu of the administrator, the debts not only do not rank at all but are not provable. As a result of the legislation which the court case proved to be flawed, debts of $38,118 could not be proven and the creditors were forced to take their case to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Cohen noted, when handing down the decision, that the outcome of the case would not have been the intended outcome of the existing legislation. He has urged legislative amendment and the result is the bill that we are discussing this morning in the chamber. It is to the credit of the minister that we are discussing this particular bill. He will even attract more credit if he adopts the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Berowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Cohen described the problem as a serious gap in the law, and one that required urgent legislative reform. At a time when there are a large number of bills banked up in the House of Representatives, it is fortunate from the point of view of the administration of corporation law in Australia that this bill has been found a place, not only on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, but in the debating schedule of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has also been regarded as serious by the Australian Securities Commission, which made submissions to the court. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reporter Chris Merritt, on 3 August 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the Federal Parliament fixes the error, institutions extending credit to many companies that have entered into a deed of company arrangement will find it almost impossible to get their money back if the company is later wound up.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Merritt said that the complicated drafting of parts of the Corporations Law means that these debts have been omitted from any category of recoverable debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, in the same article, the President of the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia, Mr Terry Taylor, was quoted as saying that, unless the confidence of the business community in deeds of company arrangements and the entire insolvency regime could be maintained, the effective administration of this part of the law would obviously be very seriously undermined. Mr Taylor pointed out that the 1993 reforms had been very well utilised, that more than 1,200 companies had entered into voluntary administration and that more than half of those had entered a deed of company arrangement with their creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have this piece of legislation before the chamber, and the coalition has moved an amendment. I strongly urge the minister to accept that amendment to improve the legislation we are currently debating. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the members of the opposition for the constructive way they have approached this issue. The government is well aware of the issue concerning the appropriate priority which should be given to post-deed creditors in a winding-up. That is the issue of whether those creditors should rank ahead of those creditors who are parties to the deed of arrangement. We do not propose at this time to accept the amendment. This is a complex issue which needs more detailed consideration, and not in the context of a bill which is designed to overcome an anomaly which requires an urgent response. This bill is not intended to make any substantive changes to the way in which the law operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the government has always intended the voluntary administration scheme, which only commenced operation in 1993, to be reviewed after a couple of years. The review is intended to commence during next year and will take into account any recommendations of the Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which I understand will be considering various technical aspects with regard to the operation of the voluntary administration scheme. I give an undertaking on behalf of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that the question of the appropriate priority that should be given to post-deed creditors when dealing with a company will also be considered as part of that wider review, and that that will be done as a process of full and open consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the opposition has indicated that it has had extensive consultations, but I am advised that the Insolvency Practitioners Association, the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Securities Commission, who were consulted by the government in relation to these amendments, all support the approach the government has taken, in view of the urgency of the situation and the fact that the issue of priority is a fundamental issue which should not be addressed in this bill. I do not accept the proposition that the opposition's amendments reflect some form of collective wisdom which has been distilled in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, there will obviously need to be persuasive reasons to give post-deed creditors a special priority, especially as this may result in pre-deed creditors being less inclined to enter into a deed in the first place. In particular, there is a real risk that pre-deed creditors would be much more likely to liquidate a company rather than to lose their priority. Another undesirable aspect of the opposition amendment is that it appears to give post-deed creditors priority over employee entitlements, and that would obviously be an undesirable result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand, in the context of the background of this, the need to proceed with the amendment. I see the fact that the consequences have not been fully thought through and may, in the view of some, undermine seriously the validity or the viability of the voluntary administration scheme. There will be a policy debate, which of course will be addressed to this next year, as part of that larger review. The policy on priority of debts is a very serious issue, and the government does not accept that it should be changed in a fundamental way in a `minutes to midnight' amendment to a bill which simply seeks to correct an anomaly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for the explanation. It may not surprise the minister that we will persist with our amendment, as these matters were the subject of some discussion. It is our view that the amendment that we propose addresses situations which could well require this protection now, and the government's remedy really only provides for an administrator to have this protection rather than for situations in which creditors have agreed to the administration being continued with the directors who have the experience, know the business and may be better placed, because of the nature of the circumstances in which the administration is occurring, to continue the management of the business. Those directors have the experience and background and are better placed to be able to trade the company out of what might have been a difficulty that arose because of a one-off situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can imagine a situation where a person has a major debt to a company and where, for one reason or another totally unrelated to the management of the business, the particular debt is one which affects the viability of the corporation because of the failure of that third party. It does not reflect upon the competency of those who were actually running the corporation. Yet the government's amendment, as we have said, will put the creditors in a situation where they cannot exercise a judgment as to whether, in the particular administration, the choice ought to be in favour of the directors continuing to run the operation. If in further examination some difficulties were raised&mdash;we do not think they would be&mdash;the matter could be addressed again. The government's proposal means that there may well be numbers of people in the same situation that we found with Crawford House that their measure will not cover or address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the opposition's point of view, it is better to proceed with this amendment and to give effect to it. If the government wants to have further consultations and discussions and give consideration to further matters which it may want to adduce at a later date, obviously it could then introduce further amendments.
