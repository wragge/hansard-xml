<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the delegation's visit to Thailand and Laos in November and December 1994 has been tabled in advance of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's reference on Australia's relations with Thailand for two major reasons. Firstly, the delegation members were greatly impressed with what they saw in Thailand. They believed their views should be tabled as quickly as possible, without waiting for the overall report on Australia's relations with Thailand. Secondly, and possibly more importantly, the delegation took the view that, if it did not report on its short visit to Laos, matters it thought were important would be overlooked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The foreign affairs subcommittee has been engaged on an inquiry into Australia's relations with Thailand since January 1994. To November 1994 we had held eight public hearings in Sydney and Melbourne as well as Canberra, taking evidence from a variety of individuals, private organisations and government departments. The subcommittee will hold its last hearing in Canberra next Monday, and the report on the reference will be tabled before the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thus delegation members were aware in general terms of the amount of reform and economic growth in Thailand over the past few years. We were not, however, prepared for the pace and variety of business and commerce in Thailand, or for the strength of that nation's intention to play a major role in the subregion. As the itinerary in appendix A to the report makes clear, while ours was not a long visit we were able to travel quite widely within Thailand. This does not mean we saw everything there is to see, nor that we are experts on that country. My colleagues will deal with particular aspects of the visit, but it is appropriate for me to pick out a few of the highlights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The  deputy  leader  of  the  delegation, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), will deal with the visits to Hellfire Pass and Kanchanaburi War Cemetery in more detail. These sites were a powerful reminder of Australian connections with Thailand, now existing for more than 50 years. It was appropriate that we were able to include these two deeply moving commemorations in our program just before the Australia Remembers activities planned for 1995 and now under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Bangkok we held discussions with a number of government ministers, departments and agencies, as well as such bodies as the UNHCR and the Export-Import Bank of Thailand. In keeping with our parliamentary focus we met with the presiding officers of the Thai parliament, with representatives of its committees and with trade union officials appointed to the Senate by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While we were in Thailand, we had the opportunity to meet with representatives of a number of Australian firms working there. A meeting with members of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce was a particularly good opportunity to find out about how Australian firms operate locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While we were in Chiang Mai, we visited an Australian owned and operated factory and received a most useful and detailed briefing. A visit to the lignite mine at Lampang, south of Chiang Mai, showed us a large AIDAB project in action. These business and industrial visits within the program showed us something of another and very important part of Australia's relationship with Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was one thing which impressed itself on the delegation it was the country's perception of its place in the region. This was dealt with in the submission to the inquiry by our own Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but we were impressed by the frank and detailed way Thai aspirations were expressed. There can be no doubt that Thailand is well positioned to be a dominant political and economic power in the region. Surrounded by Burma, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia, with Vietnam and south China as near neighbours, there are ample opportunities for Thailand's business and other skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second matter to which I would particularly like to refer is the effort Thailand is making to reform its education system. Many informants stressed Thailand's skill shortages as it grapples with swift modernisation. It was therefore very useful to have had discussions with a senior official at the ministry of education, and the minister for university affairs, before we visited the Klai Kangwol campus of the Rajamangala Institute of Technology and Mahanakorn University of Technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute is part of a wide network of such bodies and, given its closeness to the resorts of Hua Hin, its courses specialise in training personnel for the tourism and hospitality industry. Rajamangala has an association with the South Australian Department for Education, Training and Further Education, and SAGRIC, that government's international project management arm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Mahanakorn showed us something of the operations of a private university in Thailand. Open only five years ago, it specialises in engineering studies. It has a close connection with the University of New South Wales, which has been instrumental in devising its curriculum. The delegation visited Thailand at an important time, just after there had  been some  controversy over  that country's relationship with the Khmer Rouge. On each occasion this matter was raised we were at pains to put the Australian position. The delegation stressed the foreign minister's clarification that he had acted on outdated information and acknowledged the reality and range of problems on a very extensive border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation also had the opportunity to visit Laos. In 1991 the country began the process of reform by adopting a new constitution. Although we were only in Vientiane for part of a day, we were able to hold discussions with members of the National Assembly, with National Assembly committees and with the chairs of other committees. The delegation was appreciative of the very deep problems the country faces. In 1992 its adult literacy rate was at 55 per cent, its degree of urbanisation was only 20 per cent and it had a life expectancy of only 51 years and an infant mortality rate of 97 per cent. These are the difficulties with which the government currently grapples. Australia is the third largest investor and bilateral donor. This was vital to the delegation's visit. Australia has a major role in the country. That is the reason we thought it was necessary to bring this report forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told of the range of problems facing Laos, of which the most prominent was its shortage of educationally qualified personnel to allow it to function effectively in a range of international bodies. There is also a range of public health issues which need resolution. With a population of about 4.4 million, it has to face potential problems in retaining its identity, surrounded as it is by much larger neighbours, particularly Thailand. We travelled into and out of Laos across the Friendship Bridge over the Mekong river. This imposing structure was built with Australian funds and expertise. As the report makes clear, there are some problems with the operation of the bridge on the Laos side, in part  because of deficiencies in the road system. The delegation was also aware that many of the complaints reflect the realities of any international border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst in Vientiane we inspected the embassy's facilities, including the clinic, which provides medical treatment to expatriates in Vientiane. This is a valuable service to the entire diplomatic community and to Australian expatriates. The report makes a recommendation about the redevelopment of facilities at the embassy. The delegation was greatly impressed with what it saw in Vientiane and noted the concerns of the National Assembly members to solve the country's problems. The universally high regard in which Australia is held was quite obvious and we believe that Australia has an opportunity to make a valuable contribution to Laos on several fronts. Accordingly, we have recommended that in consultation with the Laotian authorities the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade hold discussions to establish whether Australia might be able to formulate programs to overcome deficiencies in the Lao road system and its health and educational systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst not making a recommendation on the subject, we believe that the relationship with Laos and its National Assembly specifically would be enhanced if Australian parliamentary delegations going to the region included the country in their itineraries more regularly than has been the case. The last visit by such a delegation in 1993 was clearly remembered by members of the National Assembly and although it was a very recent visit, admittedly, it was a very rare one. That is something the delegation wants changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program I have outlined during these remarks was seen as integral to the committee's forthcoming and overall report on relations with Thailand. I am sure we did not see everything there was to see in that country. We did make an effort to see something of the operation of Australian businesses and aid funds in various visits and discussions rather than simply be told about things in airconditioned offices in Bangkok. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was a well-balanced group which carried out a full and interesting program. I would like to thank the other members and particularly the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Casey, for their support during these visits. I would also mention the secretary who provided throughout very valuable background information, and also extend my thanks for the very strong support&mdash;as compared with some other trips I have been on&mdash;from the embassy during the visit. I would also like to thank those in the Thai and Laos governments that gave us hospitality and, at the end of the day, gave us a fuller view of the economic and strategic realities of the region. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wholeheartedly endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and compliment him on his leadership of this very important delegation. I intend, as indicated, to concentrate my remarks this afternoon on what for me&mdash;and I believe all other members of the delegation&mdash;was a particularly significant experience and a very special element of our official itinerary and duties whilst in Thailand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, of course, to our visits to both Hellfire Pass and the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery. In the time available I would like briefly to set the scene for both places. Hellfire Pass is a cutting through soil and rock on the line of the Burma-Thai railway, which was constructed for the then Imperial Japanese Army during World War II by allied prisoners of war and conscripted Asian labourers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This cutting was in two sections: one about 500 metres long and about eight metres high; and the other about 80 metres long and about 27 metres high. Much of the work was done by hand&mdash;by Australians who were under enormous pressure to complete the task. Their hours of work were lengthened significantly until they reached the literally staggering 18 hours per day; they were forced to keep working at this rate for a period of about six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who were unable to maintain their efforts&mdash;and it must be remembered that these men were captives trying to exist under the most appalling conditions&mdash;the penalties were indeed horrific. Almost 70 prisoners of war were beaten to death while working in this cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not far from the pass is the site of what was known as the `Pack of Cards' bridge&mdash;so-called because this 400 metres long by 27 metres high structure collapsed three times during construction, 31 men were killed in falls to the rocks below and another 29 were beaten to death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to stand in front of the commemorative plaques in Hellfire Pass and not be conscious of those who laboured, and perished, on this infamous site&mdash;people like Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop, who has since died and whose ashes were scattered there recently; others such as Hugh Clarke who has written so powerfully of the actual work in the pass; or indeed the late Sir Frederick `Black Jack' Galleghan who was so moved by the appalling losses suffered on the railway by the men of the 2nd 30th Battalion that when the survivors returned to Changi, in the words of another prisoner of war, the late Stan Arneil, `the iron man broke down and cried.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This incident&mdash;which serves to illustrate the enormity of the impact of the railway on those forced to build it, and on their mates&mdash;is very graphically and movingly described in Arneil's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Black Jack</EMPHASIS> and also in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians Under Nippon</EMPHASIS> by Hank Nelson and Tim Bowden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid and I laid a wreath from the government and the people of Australia to remind the tourists who visit Hellfire Pass that, despite the passing of the years, this place is remembered and revered by Australians&mdash;and always will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then went to Kanchanaburi War Cemetery where the remains of about 7,000 people are interred, including 1,362 Australians who served with our navy, army and air force. The cemetery is beautiful&mdash;it belies the horrors of the deaths of those who now rest so peacefully there. At Kanchanaburi we also laid a wreath, and then walked in silence among the graves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we noticed in both places, but in the cemetery in particular, was the number of Thais who were in the grounds. As the cemetery is on a main road this is far from surprising, but that so many should come to a resting place of foreigners who died in a war that finished 50 years ago was most poignant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid was correct when he observed that it was appropriate that a delegation from this parliament was able to visit Hellfire Pass and Kanchanaburi just before the commencement of the `Australia Remembers' commemorations. The work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at places such as Kanchanaburi and the cemetery at Ambon, which I visited with an earlier delegation in 1992, is known and respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such cemeteries are beautiful and deeply moving places to visit, carefully maintained as sacred ground for the remains of those who died in the service of their country. What is perhaps less well known is the work of a subcommittee of the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok. This body of enthusiasts has coordinated arrangements for the design, construction and maintenance of a memorial along an abandoned section of the railway line built by the prisoners of war. The way down to the pass is steep and there are now concrete steps and a handrail to assist visitors. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on the visit by the foreign affairs subcommittee to Thailand and Laos. Like the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), I felt that the visit to Hellfire Pass was a particularly moving experience. It is something I had read about, but I never thought I would experience it. For me it was particularly moving to go where so many Australians and others had suffered so dreadfully. I think it would be a moving experience for anyone to visit that part of Thailand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other members of the delegation, I was very impressed with the economic growth of Thailand. This economic growth should not obscure the many difficulties Thailand is facing, not least, I believe, in the areas of transport infrastructure and, indeed, pollution. Sooner or later, countries such as Thailand will have to come to terms with their pollution problem. The longer they leave it, the more difficult it will become. I believe there are openings for Australians with expertise in this field to assist there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was in Thailand at a particularly sensitive time in Australia-Thai relations. To say that the Thais are very sensitive to criticism, as indeed are we, real or imagined, is somewhat of an understatement. I believe the delegation helped ease a difficult period in Australia-Thai relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great opportunities for Australian businesses in Thailand, but the Australian business community in Thailand, or those in Australia intending joint ventures in Thailand, should be aware that the government's role is greater than ensuring expatriate business people continue to earn substantial profits. The government has a wider constituency than just the business community and I believe the government has a role to raise sensitive issues, be it to do with the Khmer or Burmese refugees. We will not and should not turn a blind eye to such issues just because some Australian businesses think it may offend the government and may make a dent in their already substantial profits, or may cause their already substantial profits to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, there are ways to raise sensitive issues. The very fact that they are sensitive means they should be raised with great sensitivity. I believe that when questions of great sensitivity were put to the delegation we handled them well. We were not backward in stating Australia's position, but we were very aware of the Thai sensitivity on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, another important aspect was seeing the Friendship Bridge. There has been some criticism in Australia of this bridge, but I believe it is a statement of what Australia can achieve in this part of the world. The bridge was built by Australians and is a testament to what Australia can achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we wish to achieve other things there, we might be able to assist the Lao government in remedying some of the deficiencies of the road from the bridge into the capital of the country. We had only a day in Lao and that was too short a time to make any meaningful judgment on the issues there. We were greeted with great enthusiasm. The Laos were very impressed that an Australian parliamentary delegation was there, albeit for a very brief time. There are great opportunities there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, the delegation worked well together, which in no small measure was due to the leadership of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the deputy leader, the honourable member for Casey. I welcomed the opportunity to be part of this important delegation. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of my statement, I wish to pay tribute to the leader and the deputy leader of the delegation, and congratulate them on managing a frantic schedule very well. I also pay tribute to the secretary of the committee, Mr Patrick Regan, for the tremendous work he did under very great pressure during the 10 or so days that the delegation was in Thailand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who has had an abiding interest in Thailand for about 25 years, I found these 10 days to be some of the most comprehensive I have ever spent in that country. They brought home to me not only the enormous development that has gone on in that country over the last decade or so but also the incredible opportunities that are available for Australians, should they wish to invest in Thailand or be part of its future development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and Thailand have always had quite a close relationship, which goes back over many years. It is interesting to see how many people in government, industry and community groups in Thailand have been educated in Australia. That close relationship behoves well for the building of an even closer relationship in the years to come. Obviously, it also provides us with great opportunities if we want to be part of that nation's development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms we can probably make of Australia's relationship with Thailand over the years&mdash;especially in terms of the business community&mdash;is that many Australians who have looked at investing in Thailand have never really studied the culture or language of that country. We have heard of representatives from Australian companies who have literally flown into Thailand one night, made a proposition to a business partner and flown out the following night, and wondered why they missed out on it. Thai culture requires a presence to be there, a confidence to be built and a relationship to be cemented&mdash;sometimes over many years. I hope that, in years to come, there is a much greater concentration from the Australian side on building those relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Thais are doing exactly that. English is now a compulsory subject in virtually all schools in Thailand. The Thais have taken the time to get to understand us and Western civilisation more and more and to take advantage of it. I hope that one of the recommendations of our final report will be to look at ways to bring into the Australian education system a greater understanding and a greater emphasis on the culture and language of Thailand. Quite frankly, if we are going to achieve what we would like to in a country such as that, that must happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I said, the relationship has always been fairly close and is becoming closer and closer. Over the last 10 years, we have seen an enormous wave of Australians visiting Thailand for holidays. It has been one of the prime destinations for Australian holiday-makers. Interestingly now, with the emergence of a wealthy middle class in Thailand, the reverse is starting to happen. This year, the growth rate of Thai tourists coming into Australia is in excess of 30 per cent. Around 40,000 Thais will be visiting Australia for holidays. So the system will work both ways. For that reason, we should be looking at a greater emphasis on Thai culture and Thai language in our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made mention of some of the opportunities that Australians could have in terms of pollution control, and those remarks are very true. I sometimes wonder whether we have looked at the real potential of Australian investment and the opportunity for Australians to go to Thailand and to be part of that emerging economy. Certainly pollution control is one such opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an incredible shortage of engineers. The Thai education system is now gearing itself to try to overcome that. But the delegation was told that if every child in school in Thailand today went through university and graduated Thailand still would not have enough qualified people on the ground to handle the development that is being undertaken in that country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a country that does have good relations with Thailand and a country that has connections going back through the education system, we can take great advantage of that either by being part of the education system or by providing qualified personnel to help in this development. I believe this report that is being prepared by the joint committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade is one of the most important undertaken in recent years. I certainly look forward to its conclusion. </PARA>

This demonstrates the damage which short-term speculation can do to a corporation. Such speculation is also seriously damaging to countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial markets have been the most powerful constraint on President Clinton's capacity to stimulate economic activity and to increase employment in the US. He won the election having promised to increase employment by eight million, yet was unable to introduce the infrastructure and training programs he had planned because of the limitations imposed on his administration by financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anarchic power of international financial markets is one of the principal reasons for concern about the growth of Australia's current account deficit. The larger that deficit, the more vulnerable Australia becomes to the whims of foreign exchange dealers and the more constrained the government becomes to their preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another effect of this financial market dominance is to impose a deflationary bias onto the global economy. Since the self-interest of financial markets is entirely preoccupied with low inflation, they respond to any spirited signs of economic vitality by urging restraint. Argument for contraction of public outlays&mdash;though rarely increases in taxation&mdash;plus higher interest rates is their obsessive refrain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third aspect of the damage caused by anarchic financial markets is the growth of exchange rate volatility and unpredictability. Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the global financial system has gone through waves of instability during which the exchange rates of major and minor currencies have passed well beyond rates justified by economic conditions. Both this overshooting and the constant smaller movements in exchange rates impose greater costs and risks on trade in goods and services and on international investment. Even though hedging reduces the risk, it is not costless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than liberating national monetary policy for use as a domestic policy instrument, as was also said to be a benefit of floating, monetary policy has become even more tightly constrained. Interest rates now commonly have to be set to placate the markets, not to encourage economic development let alone growth of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial transactions rather than trade now dominate most countries' balance of payments. According to the Bank for International Settlements, BIS, daily net turnover was close to $US900 billion in April 1992&mdash;which is around $1,200 billion or $1,300 billion&mdash;almost three times its value in 1986 and around 12 times the combined GDP of OECD countries on an annualised basis. Only about five per cent of this relates to trade and longer term investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only the unemployed in Australia but also, very recently, the people of Mexico are partly the victims of international financial markets. The collapse in the value of the peso is forcing the introduction of sharp cuts in wages and of increases in mortgage interest rates to 48 per cent in some cases. Mexican living standards have been slashed in order to justify the international reserve package, which has been introduced, and to reassure the markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic, by the way, that this US government and IMF rescue package of $US50 billion is being justified by Camdessus, the head of the IMF, as necessary to ensure continuation of `market-oriented approaches the IMF has been promoting in countries such as Mexico'. The biggest government rescue package in history is being justified by the need to enhance the market even further&mdash;when market failure is so demonstrably part of the cause of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary of the Campbell committee, which recommended the deregulation of the Australian financial system in the early 1980s, said recently that `financial markets have become a frankenstein monster which is devouring us'. Fortunately, policies are available which would at least reduce the damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A combination of policies is certainly required which would effectively reduce the influence of financial markets and the risks of instability or even of crisis. Amongst these, strengthened disclosure requirements, accounting standards and prudential controls are certain to be a part. Another, which has much to commend it, is a small multilateral tax on foreign exchange transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal by the Nobel laureate in economics, Professor James Tobin, has two basic motivations. He writes: . . . one is to increase the weight that market participants give to long-range fundamentals relative to immediate speculative opportunities. The second is to allow greater autonomy to national monetary policies by making possible greater differences between short-term interest rates in different currencies.</PARA>
<PARA>Increasing the cost of short-term speculative transactions would reduce the extent of exchange rate fluctuations. The tax could be set at a rate which would be too small to deter trade or movements of investment capital but which would penalise short-term speculation. By reducing the potential return to foreign exchange speculation, the tax would discourage the wasteful application of skilled personnel and scarce capital to such activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal criticism of the proposal relates to the difficulty of achieving agreement amongst all major countries involved in foreign exchange dealing. Yet in the late 1980s the Bank for International Settlements succeeded in achieving agreement between countries to set increased prudential reserve ratios for commercial banks. Since the tax would be of benefit to everyone, except foreign exchange dealers and the companies for which they work, such agreement could well be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments would benefit from the greater capacity for discretionary monetary policy, from the reduction in interference in national policy by financial dealers and from the additional revenue. The tax is electorally popular: few people like speculators. In US jargon, this is a tax on Wall Street, not on `Main Street'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the revenue could also be used for establishing a permanent, reliable source of funding for the United Nations system at last. The extent of this automatic funding would have to be settled at the time the administrative arrangements for the tax are negotiated and would no doubt depend in part on the tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the tax was set at 0.1 per cent, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter as a result and 10 per cent of the revenue was allocated to the UN, receipts for multilateral purposes would total around $US10 billion annually, after allowing for some exemptions and evasion. Revenue received by the UN could be used for disaster relief, security and development. Surely it is desirable that the UN should have an automatic source of funding for those enormously important tasks rather than having to go around to governments cap in hand every time there is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question for business is whether the benefits for trade and investment from reduced exchange rate volatility, reduced investment risk and improved economic policy making would be sufficient to offset the cost of paying the tax. This also depends in part on the rate at which the tax is set. Tobin suggested a rate of 0.5 per cent. Others consider this too high and have suggested anywhere between 0.01 and 0.25 per cent. It does seem likely that there would be some rate at which the benefits for business might well offset the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for a foreign exchange transaction levy is growing; for example, amongst prominent US economists, multilateral agencies such as the ILO, the UNDP and the Commission on Global Governance, and some governments. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) canvassed this idea at the General Assembly early in October last year, and a motion was passed by the national conference of the Australian Labor Party that encourages the government to advocate international study of the idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Summit for Social Development, which is being held next week, offers an opportunity to take the idea further. The draft program of action proposed study of `new and innovative forms of funding' for the UN, and no government dissented from that recommendation. This will certainly include study of a foreign exchange transaction levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A levy such as this seems the best available option for reducing the power of financial markets, reducing exchange rate volatility and raising revenue for high priority domestic and international economic, social and security programs. These are all necessary conditions for an effective reduction of poverty, faster growth of employment and stronger social integration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We in the coalition are opposed to the introduction of an international tax on foreign exchange transactions, commonly referred to as a securities transactions tax&mdash;STT&mdash;as proposed by Professor Tobin of Yale University and advocated in this place by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I point out that the use of taxes and fees in an attempt to reduce excess speculation has a long history in the United States and was first proposed in 1863. It has obviously not been enthusiastically received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of compelling arguments for rejection of an STT. First and foremost, the proposed tax would considerably reduce Australia's sovereignty. The most recent proponent of the proposal, Professor Tobin of Yale University, proposes that the tax proceeds would go to the World Bank. However, we in the coalition would be opposed to cede our sovereignty to a supranational authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are opposed to ceding control over monetary policy which reflects Australians' interest and priorities to a supranational institution which could make decisions contrary to Australia's national interest, to our policy traditions and, above all, to our definitions of our national and economic interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Second, we reject the radical nature of this proposal. We believe that the transfer of sovereignty to the United Nations should not be contemplated. Support for the establishment of a study group under United Nations auspices would, on probabilities, facilitate and eventually legitimise the emergence of the UN with a new central role in international finance and banking. Such a transfer of sovereignty should not be entertained by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the proposed tax, like all utopian proposals, is severely impractical. The proponents of an STT argue that it would reduce excessive volatility in financial markets. However, defining excessive volatility is a value judgment. It is difficult to precisely determine the fundamental value of a security. At best, we can estimate. However, without such knowledge, we cannot determine excessive volatility. Furthermore, excessive volatility is more likely to be episodic and not a permanent feature of financial markets. The world-wide stock market crash in 1987 was not alleviated by an STT, despite the fact that most industrialised nations at that time, including Japan and the United Kingdom, had an STT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Empirical studies have demonstrated that, first, an STT cannot be used with confidence as an effective policy instrument and that, second, other factors being equal, an STT may increase volatility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, an STT would harm all investors. The cost of capital could rise. With falling stock prices, it would be more costly for firms to raise capital through issuing stock. An increase in the cost of capital would reduce the amount of business fixed investment and make it more expensive to raise funds in the stock market. All traders would have to pay more each time they traded.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Langmore" NAMEID="KG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr Langmore</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You haven't listened to the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KD4">Mr ALDRED</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You might not like the arguments that have been raised in opposition to it. Since stock prices would fall after the introduction of an STT, all stock holders would be adversely affected. Each investor would have to calculate the payable tax when selling the security. The price to the subsequent seller will also be reduced as further tax will have to be paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, a foreign substitution problem would arise. Individuals could avoid the STT by changing what and where they traded&mdash;from securities that are taxed to securities that are not taxed, and from securities that are highly taxed to those that are lightly taxed. West Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden are scrapping their transaction taxes, partly because these taxes resulted in a substantial shift of business to the London market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of Sweden is instructive. No doubt Sweden, as the preferred socio-economic model of the honourable member for Fraser and many of his colleagues, should be of particular interest. In 1986, Sweden introduced an STT for political reasons, at the request of the labour sector. The results were calamitous. Sixty per cent of trading activity shifted to London. Capital gains tax revenue fell so much in response to lower trading that gains from the tax were offset. Trading in Swedish public debt was so adversely affected that taxes on bond trading were eventually removed. There was a dramatic drop in trading volumes. The interest rate options market evaporated. Sweden subsequently abolished its tax in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative problems of the tax have been noted by leading US authorities. In 1991, the Congressional Budget Office admitted that an STT would be exceedingly difficult to administer and that it would be difficult to tax foreign transactions. In 1990, the US House of Representatives joint committee on taxation declared that the tax would create administrative problems, with the potential to distort the US capital market to the detriment of private industry and the investment public. Financial firms would be given further incentive to design new STT tax exempt securities. There would be massive compliance problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, given the intrinsic difficulties in designing a broad based tax that is not easily avoided, it is not surprising that no nation is considering an STT or even increasing its pre-existing STT. As the total value of global currency exchanges was some $US280 trillion in 1992, we can appreciate the administrative problems involved in devising and administering such a tax. It would be an administrative nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the proposal referred to earlier by the honourable member for Fraser for the establishment of an STT by a UN study group under UN auspices&mdash;including the International Monetary Fund&mdash;which is to be discussed at the UN World Summit for Social Development in March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is to be congratulated on rejecting, at first, the entreaties of his senior colleagues&mdash;including those of the foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)&mdash;to attend this meeting. The Prime Minister was obviously aware that the United Nations, fresh from its recent dubious successes in solving the Bosnian and Somalian conflicts, has nothing to offer Australia in relation to this issue. For once he was correct, but evidently he lacked the failure of his original convictions and now, reportedly, plans to attend the UN summit. We can only, in this House, take the opportunity to congratulate him on this rare and temporary lapse into good judgment. Perhaps the member for Fraser could, at the appropriate time, inform the House of the obviously substantive differences he has with the Prime Minister on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the honourable member for Fraser refers to the damage done to the Australian economy by the international financial market turbulence. I would suggest, in conclusion, that the honourable member for Fraser focus his attention on the damage done to Australia by the incurring of a net foreign debt of, still, over $160 billion under the federal Labor government. That directly productive task should concentrate his attention wonderfully and more productively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence by reminding the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) that the tax which is the subject of this motion is a tax on international transactions only. Most of his comments obviously related to taxes on domestic transactions. Quite clearly, I think we on this side would accept that, where we have a tax on transactions imposed in one country in ultimately what is an internationalised market, that has potential implications elsewhere. But we are talking here about an international tax, a tax on transactions across the globe. Until such time as we have a Mars stock exchange or a Jupiter stock exchange, it will be rather difficult for that tax to be avoided in the same way as the examples in Sweden and the like to which he referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also worth pointing out that the motion proposes simply that the issue be studied, that the proposition be seriously examined and that the Australian government cooperate with and assist in such study. Yes, obviously there is a degree of idealism associated with this proposition&mdash;but that idealism is heading in the same direction in which the reality of world economics is heading. Many propositions throughout human history that have been idealistic at a certain point have ultimately come to pass as practical reality maybe a generation or two later. When we see the speed of change that is occurring in our world, I think it is worth while for us to give serious consideration to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is notable that people of such stature as the President of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, have actually advocated serious consideration of the so-called Tobin tax. In Euromoney only about a year and a half ago, Hans Tietmeyer was quoted as saying that there was a great need for more regulation of international financial flows and that it was important in order to protect the European monetary system. The proposal is designed to increase the influence of long-term fundamental economic factors, underlying factors of productivity and comparative advantage and the like, as against the inevitable impact of short-term speculative influences that have increased enormously over the past 10 or 15 years in the international economic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the introduction of new technology, including electronic technology and the like, the ability to trade vast sums of money almost instantaneously has greatly increased speculative flows. The suggested transaction tax of Professor Tobin&mdash;and I quote him&mdash;`is designed to make international money markets compatible with modest national autonomy in monetary and macro-economic policy.' I will refer again in greater response to the comments of the honourable member for Deakin on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax proposed by Professor Tobin was something like half a per cent. Various alternatives have been suggested but that is probably the highest alternative; others have been 0.1 per cent of the amount traded. It is estimated by Professor Tobin that half a per cent tax on currency transactions would make a four per cent difference in annual interest rates on three-month bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of proceeds going to the World Bank from such a tax is obviously a fairly radical suggestion, but I think in the long term we will end up with international institutions that have a tax base that extends beyond the whims of the individual governments that are ultimately linked to those institutions. Through international transactions is one of the more obvious ways of doing it. I do not see why we should suddenly clothe ourselves in paranoia about one world government and descend into the backblocks of Alabama or whatever and start parroting those cries just because these sorts of suggestions are being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speculation is a problem. Go to any manufacturer in Melbourne and ask how important the value of the Australian dollar is to them. When we go and talk with people in some of the commodity industries we find the same thing: a volatile dollar is a serious problem for people who are trading. Something that is desperately needed by our industries, and I am sure the same applies to industries in other countries, more than just about anything else is a stable currency regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the key reason we no longer have a stable currency regime? It is not only because the dollar has been floated; there are also the gains that are to be made and the technology which permits those gains to be made by short-term speculation. Clearly it is very difficult in an open international economy to eliminate speculation, but I think there is a fairly strong argument to suggest that the amount of speculation that does occur is out of proportion to what should be permitted in a real economic situation and that taxation is the legitimate device&mdash;and in this instance it has to be international.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the point that was made by the honourable member for Deakin that purely on a national basis that sort of thing is almost certainly doomed to fail, and therefore it has to be on an international basis in order to shift it back more towards the fundamentals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question is how much productive energy in societies such as ours is actually going into speculation. To what extent do we have firms like AWA investing lots of energy, lots of talent and ultimately lots of money in playing the currency market rather than in concentrating on its core business of producing the products it is supposedly good at?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bretton Woods agreement established the basis for the control of international financial flows effectively for about 50 years, but it is quite clear now that we have such a radically different international monetary system that a new international framework needs to evolve, one with less volatility and one where speculation does not completely dominate as&mdash;certainly it is arguable&mdash;it does today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that on the question of international treaties honourable members opposite tend to foam at the mouth a bit whenever the federal government legislates on the basis of international treaties, but there is an underlying reality as to why Australia is more and more relying on international treaties as the basis for legislation. That is because life itself is becoming more international; the world is becoming increasingly international; and it is therefore only logical that government activity will be increasingly internationally interdependent, and this is precisely what this proposition reflects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All one has to do is look back to Australia 100 years ago and recall that it was common to have tariffs between the then colonies. There were tariffs on goods transferring between New South Wales and Victoria. Think how ludicrous, ridiculous and difficult to enforce that would be now. What has happened, of course, is that the effective boundaries of economic and social activity, not only in this country but across the world, have spread enormously. Therefore regulation, taxation and all forms of government activity are inexorably being pushed in the same direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, if we want to tackle this problem of excessive speculation, it has to be done internationally. That is why we are seeing moves&mdash;however difficult, however much beset with problems&mdash;towards a single European currency. It is for exactly the same reasons. Ultimately that will come about. It may not be next year or the year after, but eventually there will be a single European currency and those sorts of movements will all go in the one direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the Internet, from which a whole array of issues will emerge. There is the possibility of the emergence of an Internet currency that would be separate from all the world currencies. People would exchange services on the Internet and pay for them ultimately through some sort of barter system. All sorts of international taxation and regulatory issues will emerge from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax would not reduce Australia's sovereignty or the sovereignty of any countries across the world. It would not involve us ceding control over monetary policy. Ironically, it would enhance the impact of domestic monetary policy, because the balance of influence that is currently being taken away from national governments by unrestricted speculation and international financial flows would be tilted back in favour of national governments. So the incentive for that speculation, which ultimately has such an enormous influence on what goes on in national economies, would be reduced. Therefore, the level of speculation would be reduced and the power of national governments would be increased, ironic as it may seem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Merely looking at the issue does not legitimise it automatically, as the honourable member for Deakin suggested. Certainly it accords it with some seriousness. People of the stature of Professor Tobin and Professor Richard Cooper from Harvard and the head of the Bundesbank are saying that we have to look at it. It is being considered, irrespective of whether we like it or not. If we want to be part of the legitimate international debate on issues such as this, it is perfectly appropriate for us to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point, which relates to the final point of the honourable member for Deakin, concerns the United Nations world summit on social development. No doubt the honourable member for Deakin sees this as some sort of KGB conspiracy, the one world government conspiracy surfacing again or perhaps the Fabian Society. Virtually all the heads of government in our region will be there, so no doubt he had better get on the phone to the prime ministers and presidents of Indonesia, Japan, China and Malaysia and so forth and point out the lack of wisdom in their participating. In my view, we would look foolish if our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pulled out from participating. Poverty and social development issues are international in character, as are questions of speculation and economic flows across countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We should see this motion for what it is. It is a proposal that Australia involve itself in the world stage as an advocate for the study of a new tax on international financial transactions. It suggests that Australia put itself in a position where it would be seen to be not realising the full implications of such a proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point is that trillions of dollars are traded on international money markets throughout the year. It is typical of Labor members to advocate a levy on this source of funding in order for them to find the solution to the United Nations' financial dilemma. Whilst I fully support the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in his zeal to find more responsible funding for the United Nations, because it is in turmoil in its 50th year, there are, in my view, disgraceful indications of a lack of financial responsibility by some of its members. There are considerable defaults by members of the United Nations in their contributions. So I do not for one moment resile from the fact that Australia should be in the thick of it in advocating that members honour their responsibilities and not leave it to a few to carry the burden of all the work that needs to be done in this world. Let me not conceal my zeal for that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting Australia in the position on the international stage of saying that the solution to the UN's administration and its future programs can be found by sourcing a vast funding base from international money transactions is, in my view, very naive and dangerous. That would only cement some of the inefficiencies of the UN of which we know. If the UN does not seek to convince each member every three or five years about its programs and has to put up good management propositions, and if the UN simply relies on this huge resource of permanent funding from a levy on international money transactions, I predict that we will get more chaos and bad decision making from the UN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members are already opting out of their responsibilities in UN financial terms. They will further opt out simply because the focus will be off their not making annual contributions to particular projects. They will be able to say, `All your funding is provided out of the international funding levy.' Let us not be disillusioned by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is that it is somewhat ironic that senior members of the government, the Labor Party, are here today advocating that Australia involve itself in high level advocacy of this new international tax at a time when they have just backed off from the proposal to introduce a carbon tax, which also stems from international discussions. For the life of me I cannot accept that the government's abandonment of the carbon tax is a permanent abandonment at all; I think it has just been put aside for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have another illustration of the Labor government looking for revenue the easy way instead of being fully accountable. This Labor government campaigned against the coalition and against a GST, a levy on sales and services. It did so with great vigour and great misrepresentation, I might remind honourable members. Now we have two senior members of the Labor government advocating a new form of levy, this time on trillions of dollars in international money terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we really need is for Labor members, particularly senior members, to be taking their Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Treasurer (Mr Willis) to account and making them address the very serious current account deficit of $26 billion and the net debt in excess of $160 billion, which has risen at astronomical and frightening levels and which is going to rob our children of their heritage because of the huge costs of servicing and repaying such a large debt. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this government has increased its expenditure by about 20 per cent in the last 12 months, at a time when all state and local governments, businesses&mdash;large and small&mdash;and families have had to pull in their belts as a consequence of the recession which the Prime Minister caused Australia to go into at such deep and painful levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other practical reasons for me warning the parliament about this proposal and urging it not to fall for the trick of getting involved as an advocate in high level negotiations overseas. The first is that the international tax is recognised as one that could have many harmful side effects and that the benefits that are glibly referred to are sweeping under the carpet the real adverse effects on our nation. The first adverse effect of a financial tax or levy would be to penalise all investors, large and small&mdash;not just short-term traders and speculators but also people in the real business of business and of saving for retirement. The cost of capital actually would rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member does not agree with me about Australia's impending crisis, then I would like to remind him that it is recognised in the OECD that one of the greatest problems that will be facing all nations in the world, particularly Australia, by the turn of the century is the serious shortage of capital in the world. Australia as a very small nation is one of those countries which will feel this more and more&mdash;more than anyone else. The consequent increase in the cost of getting capital will inflict on Australia higher costs of interest, service charges and acquisition fees. This tax adds to the cost of all of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is really sentencing us to more costs and more problems in trying to get this nation back on its feet financially. It penalises all investors, not just short-term traders. The fact is that all of these costs are added by the traders and must be borne by the ultimate person who borrows. That is the fact of life. Those on the other side are trying to put onto small business, medium business, large business, local government, hospitals and all of us who are trying to get infrastructure going in Australia an additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should be advocating is a lowering of costs and ways to do that. This levy will not lower costs; it will increase costs. The hedging costs of investors and traders are always added to the price of the borrowed dollar. Ultimately, Australia, as a large borrower, due largely to the government's mismanagement over the last 12 years, will have to pay a greater share. That is beyond argument, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that a lot of Australia's savings are in mutual funds, such as AMP and National Mutual. We are looking at them changing. Perhaps they will; perhaps they will be floated. It is a fact of life that Australia's householders have saved very heavily in mutual funds. Mutual funds, for the information of the honourable member on the other side, the honourable member for Fraser, if he does not realise this, by their very nature are one of the largest traders in international currency. They handle vast sums of money. Every day they incur substantial trading costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What my friend is doing is saying to all the policyholders of AMP and National Mutual, `I want to add to your costs, and therefore reduce your returns, your bonuses and your accumulated benefits, by putting this burden on you.' That is a fact of life. He is trying to put another cost on the small people, the little people, of Australia. I am sure he does not realise that that is what he is doing, but the fact is that that is the consequence of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem, and it relates to stock prices. Stock exchange prices would certainly fall. Many commentators say that, after the introduction of the international levy, stock prices would fall from 2.3 per cent to five per cent. Stock prices have already moved lower this year because of the fear about the government's mismanagement of the economy, the rising current account deficit, increasing interest rates and the failure of the government to address its fiscal and monetary policies. So we have real problems there, and we have another one being advocated. God help Australia. Heaven forbid!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that the cost of capital at the turn of the century would be a larger problem for Australia than for most other nations. If we have accompanying that particular phenomenon falling stock prices, it will be more costly for firms to raise capital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House acknowledges the need for more research into prostate cancer and that money be allocated for a major education program targeting Australian males.</PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion, I have a simple message for all the men in this parliament: if you live long enough, you will end up with a prostate problem. I have a simple message for every Australian male: if you live long enough, you will end up with a prostate problem as well. You may not get prostate cancer but, if you live long enough, you will end up with a prostate problem. I did. I had surgery last December in Prince Henry Hospital. I am announcing that not because I think anybody is interested in what happened with my prostate but as part of the job we have to do to raise the awareness of Australian men so that they are prepared to talk about it, to understand it and to take action about it. I pay tribute to the surgeon Dr Robert Farnsworth, the head of the urology department at Prince Henry Hospital&mdash;an excellent man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is male fear. There is a reluctance to talk about prostate problems. The prostate can become engaged with three problems: first, prostatitis, which is basically an infection caused by bacteria and which is fixed by antibiotics, so for our purposes we will not worry about that particularly; second, enlargement of the prostate with benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH; and, third, prostate cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both BPH and prostate cancer occur usually in males older than 50 years. The older you are, the more likely you are to develop BPH or prostate cancer. Prostate cancer grows very slowly. There is histological evidence of prostate cancer of no great significance during their lifetime in 30 per cent of males over the age of 50 years, but 80 per cent of males over the age of 80 years have the same histological evidence of prostate cancer. Australian males have a one in 23 chance of developing prostate cancer in their lifetime and a one in 70 chance of dying from it before the age of 75. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer&mdash;after lung cancer&mdash;occurring in Australian men in terms of incidence and mortality. What is the prostate? The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cancer Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines the prostate as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the male sex glands located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It is about the size of a walnut and is wrapped around part of the urethra. It produces fluid that becomes part of the semen.</PARA>
<PARA>When I talk to young men, old men and middle-aged men I am constantly amazed that they do not know what the prostate is, they do not know where it is and they do not know what it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the motion calls for more funding for education. What is BPH? The prostate increases in size as we age. The BPH affects approximately 50 per cent of all men over 50 years of age. We do not know why it grows; we need research to find out. Australian men need to know the symptoms. In December, when I was recuperating from surgery, I was visited by some friends. One man said to me, `Yes, I have got all of those symptoms, but I am too scared to go to the doctor.' The symptoms are: delay in beginning urination; lack of pressure when urinating; dribbling at the end of urination; urinary infection; increased urge to urinate at night; sudden blockage of urine flow; urgency; and retention of urine in the bladder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the men of Australia: if you have any of those symptoms see your doctor. Do not leave it. Do not let it go. Do not be fearful. Find out and get treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one per cent of cases of prostate cancer are detected in men under 50 years of age, but 50 per cent of men over the age of 70 have prostate cancer. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cancer Dictionary</EMPHASIS> says that `not much is known about the causes of prostate cancer'. We need to know. We need research. In a paper released by Pienta and Esper we see the statement `a definitive cause for prostate cancer has not been established'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while comparing the incidence of breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer. In 1988, breast cancer was diagnosed in 6,542 women and 54 men; cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1,061 women; prostate cancer was diagnosed in 4,566 men; and 354 men had cancer of the testes. In 1991, 6,261 men were found to have prostate cancer. In 1993, 2,641 women died from breast cancer, 317 women died from cervical cancer and 2,544 men died from prostate cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to compare the funding for screening and research. I will not go into the details, but from 1991-92 research and screening for breast cancer has accounted for $322,370,000; research and screening for cervical cancer  has  accounted  for $23,560,000; and the total for prostate cancer research was only $661,765. I do not begrudge 1c of the money that has gone into research and screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer. I merely make the comparison and point out that the males of Australia are lagging behind in the amount of money available for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diagnosis of prostate cancer involves three main procedures. The first of these is digital rectal examination. This is the most common procedure where the doctor puts a rubber glove on his hand, puts a finger up the rectum and has a feel around. It is not a particularly attractive test for most men, and it is not particularly sensitive. In an article by Whelan entitled `What they don't tell you about prostate cancer' it is said that `thirty to 60 per cent of men with prostate cancer have tumours that the examining physician cannot feel'. It is simply not enough to have the digital rectal examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second procedure is prostate specific antigen&mdash;PSA. This is a blood test that measures a substance&mdash;PSA&mdash;which is secreted only by the prostate. An elevated level of PSA may indicate cancer, but it can also be elevated in benign prostatic hypoplasia as well. However, a recently published large-scale study by Gann et al, which measured PSA levels in blood samples taken from participants upon their entry to the Physicians' Health Study (US) in 1982 and analysed 366 of these men who were eventually diagnosed with prostate cancer, found that a single PSA measurement had a `relatively high sensitivity and specificity for detection of prostate cancer that arose within four years'. The authors concluded, `PSA has the highest validity of any circulating cancer screening marker discovered thus far.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third is transrectal ultrasound, which involves the insertion of an ultrasound probe into the rectum and sound waves bouncing off the prostate. This is not usually used as an initial test, rather for confirmation. It should be pointed out that the only definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer is by biopsy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is controversy over the thought of having screening programs. The American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association recommend that all men over 50 years of age have a digital rectum examination and a PSA test each year. In Australia the National Health and Medical Research Council is reviewing evidence for and against prostate cancer screening, but the Australian Cancer Society has recommended in guidelines released in December 1994 against screening men without symptoms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last point in relation to that is that men with symptoms suggestive of benign or malignant prostatic disease should be assessed by a medical practitioner. I come back to the point that any male who has symptoms must see his doctor as soon as possible. We should also note that the symptoms of prostate cancer are similar to BPH. But men should not take a risk. If they are over 50 and have any symptoms they should see their doctor as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion and am pleased to support it. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cecil Textbook of Medicine</EMPHASIS>, the prostate is the second leading site of cancer in males&mdash;although I think in Australia it is the third leading site of cancer in males&mdash;accounting for about 19 per cent of all male cancers. The only female cancer that accounts for more new cancer cases per year is cancer of the breast. The figures that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has given in his excellent argument show that the number of people who suffer from prostate cancer is about two-thirds of the number of people who suffer from breast cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should have research, but we also should admit that whether all information about research ought to be released is a subject for debate, particularly in the case of breast cancer. Just recently I noticed on a science program that there was some argument that some of the information given to women about breast cancer has been misleading to them and has sometimes been misused. My view is that this is not a case for suppressing information about research to adults in the community, wherever they are. The old idea of hiding information from people has not worked all that well. Perhaps we ought to present information better and more clearly, but we certainly should not suppress information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 8.7 per cent of white males and 9.4 per cent of non-white males will develop cancer of the prostate. It is calculated that 2.6 per cent of newborn white males and 4.3 per cent of newborn non-white males will eventually die of the disease. Carcinoma of the prostate, interestingly, does not develop in eunuchs, but there is no other evidence to suggest that a direct relationship exists between hormone levels and the development of prostatic cancer. Similarly, no relationship between the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic cancer has been demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, according to Cecil, there is little relationship between prostatic cancer and industrial carcinogens, cigarette smoking, use of alcohol, disease patterns, circumcision, weight, height, blood group or hair distribution. Perhaps I have gone a bit further than the honourable member for Cowper in that area. Just because he has suffered the disease does not mean that I will because I am balder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As carcinoma of the prostate progresses, the tumour can extend to other areas, as happens with most cancers. It can extend to the urethra, the bladder neck, the seminal vesicles, and the trigone. But perhaps I have said enough about the medical aspects of cancer of the prostate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to extend what the honourable member for Cowper has said on a couple of issues. Firstly, I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 January where, under guidelines which were to be released this month by the nation's peak cancer body, the Australian Cancer Society, it was indicated that testing all men over 50 for prostate cancer may do more harm than good. That may well be true. I do not want to enter into that debate. I mention it simply to make clear that the motion is calling for more research; it is not necessarily calling for more screening. Debate ought to continue and the need for screening ought to be clarified. Some recent methods have been developed which may not require the sort of rectal examination that the honourable member for Cowper talked about. If we can get to that stage, maybe we can have relatively safe screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own belief is that anything that involves the sort of procedures associated with screening at the moment ought to be very carefully considered, particularly for older men. After all, it is once men reach middle age that the tendency towards prostatic cancer increases. Dr Jeanette Ward, who helped prepare the guidelines that I mentioned, has said that there is no evidence that early detection reduced deaths. I believe that ought to be good enough for us at this time. Until there are better methods, we should be careful about the amount of screening we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is no argument against further research.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the amount of research that is being done could be increased. For instance, the National Health and Medical Research Council spent $341,765 in 1994, but $320,000 was provided to support other research projects. Prostate cancer has not been a major focus for research funding. Second only in incidence to breast cancer, it ought to be receiving more funding. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS> recently said that the disease has been underresearched and underfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1994 the Australian Cancer Society identified some urgent areas for research. They include: contributing to international efforts to evaluate the outcomes of prostatic cancer screenings using community based randomised trials; rigorous evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predicative values of alternative tests in community populations; assessment of men's attitudes to prostate cancer, their views on the purposes and limitation of screening programs, and the value they place on years of life lost through malignant prostate disease compared with other significant causes of death and disability among men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Cowper said, we need more awareness among people of prostate cancer. I have had letters from women expressing concern about the amount of research that is being undertaken into prostatic cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area for research is the need for assessment of the views of general practitioners, urologists, pathologists and radiation oncologists about prostate cancer screening and their preferred sources of information and current practices to assess how widespread unproven screening activity has become. We cannot just say that screening is pointless; we ought to be assessing how widespread the unproven activity has become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which would be very useful is the design, implementation and controlled evaluation of intervening to defuse public and professional anxiety about prostate cancer screening where it is safe, and particular strategies are needed to reduce unproven screening activity and general practice until there is stronger scientific evidence to support screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be methodological research to measure urological outcomes in prostate cancer management and palliation. There needs to be more systematic evaluation of the management of prostate cancer by stage and age to determine complication rates, the prognosis and the predictors of outcome. It could well be that it is important to do research for the sake of those people who are younger and who have prostate cancer at a reasonably young age as well as those who are older. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small scale projects are needed to ascertain the feasibility in Australia of follow-up for men with abnormal results should screening at some time prove to be effective. The nature of quality assurance mechanisms and strategies to enhance compliance with repeated screening and follow-up treatment merit some of those types of projects. As well, there could well be the development of more accurate tests to predict prostate cancers which will progress and those which will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been recent calls for mass screening. I agree with Dr Jeanette Ward that we ought to be wary about that because of the type of method that is used in the principal means of screening at the moment. But, according to Dr Ward, the findings from overseas studies which may be able to answer the most pressing question of whether screening reduced prostate deaths unfortunately are not due for about five years. But there is strong evidence that the prostate specific antigen, PSA, blood test, which could be available soon, may accurately detect a significant majority of aggressive prostate cancers. While we have this optimism, let us take advantage of it and have more research. </PARA>

Before I call the honourable member for Cowan, I point out to the honourable member for Cowper that the words that he sought to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> do not meet the Speaker's guidelines and do not take the form of the charts that I as Deputy Speaker and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence had presumed they did when leave for incorporation was granted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for bringing to the House this motion acknowledging the need for more research into prostate cancer. Many people do not have the foggiest idea of what the prostate is or what it does. To understand the problems surrounding the detection and treatment of prostate cancer it is essential to recognise that this type of cancer in some form is extremely common, particularly as men age, but that it often grows slowly and, in many cases, is not life threatening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer in men in most Western countries. Each year more than 2,000 Australians die from prostate cancer and a further 5,000 new cancers are diagnosed. An Australian male has a one in 23 chance of developing prostate cancer during his lifetime and a one in 70 chance of dying from it before the age of 75. Prostate diseases usually occur in men older than 50, although prostatic symptoms are more common before middle age. Prostate cancer is rarely seen in males under 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the proceedings are being broadcast, I guess it is an idea to identify some of the symptoms associated with prostate cancer: the need to pass urine more frequently and during the night; difficulty in starting urine flow; a slow, interrupted flow and a dribbling afterwards; sudden, strong urges to pass urine; a feeling of not having completely emptied the bladder; and pain or burning during urination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research has shown that possible risk factors identified with prostate cancer include: diet&mdash;high fat consumption, low green vegetable consumption; genetic&mdash;family history of prostate or breast cancer; occupational&mdash;in other words, cadmium exposure, radiation exposure; sexual history&mdash;a number of sexual partners, frequency of intercourse; medical history&mdash;vasectomy, benign prostatic hyperplasia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these risk factors known as causes of prostate cancer, the logical solution to reduce the incidence of the cancer is to make men more aware of the condition, especially those who are at an age where they are vulnerable to developing prostate cancer. We should make them aware of some of the measures that can prevent prostate cancer from developing any further. For example, they could learn to control their diet. By eating non-fat foods they can reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the treatments for prostate cancer vary according to the degree of the cancer. Prostate cancer may be treated by surgery, radiotherapy or hormone treatment: medications, including those with hormone levels which relax the prostate; surgery to remove the enlarged part of the prostate; or radiotherapy&mdash;that is, laser or microwave and heat treatments. These procedures are still relatively new and need further long-term evaluation. The treatment options available for prostate cancer depend on the grade and stage of the disease as well as the patient's age, life expectancy and general health. It is more likely that the patient will die of other causes than prostate cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three main procedures can be used as an aid in diagnosis of the prostate cancer: firstly, digital rectal examination or DRE; secondly, prostate specific antigen; and, thirdly, trans-rectal ultrasound. Research indicates that using a combination of the above tests may be a more effective method of diagnosing prostate cancer than using only one method. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of barriers making this impossible. For example, the golden standard of prostate cancer detection has long been the digital rectal examination or DRE. This is easy to perform and is an inexpensive method which has been rejected by many men. Even though the test can usually be done quickly and with little discomfort, some men will not submit to a rectal examination unless they are having severe problems, usually related to urination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, an education program in this area would help things greatly. A campaign targeted at men over 50 to have tests done will benefit those with an early stage of prostate cancer, so that it may be determined as to what is the best treatment for their condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate advantages of the prostate specific antigen are that it is objective, quantifiable and more comfortable than the DRE. But even its most enthusiastic supporters recognise that the PSA has limitations. Its results include both false negatives and false positives. A man can have prostate cancer even in an advanced stage and still have a normal PSA reading. From this there is considerable controversy over whether any of the above procedures should be considered for mass screening of men to detect prostate cancer. The cumulative harmful effects of screening many men may outweigh the benefits of earlier diagnosis of the few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an analogy. Suppose you wanted to build a fence to keep three types of animals&mdash;turtles, birds and rabbits&mdash;on your property. The birds would soon be gone, flying over the fence to parts unknown; the turtles would plod around slowly, but none would ever reach the end of the property; and the rabbits would hop around and, eventually, unless you stopped them, clear the fence and escape. In other words, the fence would be effective only for the rabbits. The turtles do not need it and the birds would ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we apply this analogy to clinical prostate cancer, the birds are men who are beyond cure because their malignancies have metastasised; the turtles are patients with low grade, non-aggressive, non-life threatening prostate cancer; and the rabbits would be the only ones to gain from the screening. To screen the turtles would cause unnecessary pain and inconvenience and the birds can be treated only with non-surgical assistance to make their lives more comfortable. Treating all the men diagnosed as having prostate cancer, therefore, would mean saving the lives of a third of them, at most, at the cost of some degree of unnecessary incapacitation in twice as many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, what we need is not massive screening but methods of determining which of the prostate confined cancers are real and would benefit from surgery and which of them are harmless and should be left alone. None of the methods practised now absolutely guarantee the results that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that more research needs to be done into the causes and various treatments of prostate cancer. Because the procedures now in place do not guarantee detection of prostate cancer or provide the right solution as to what the best treatment might be, mass screening for prostate cancer is not necessarily the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Australian Cancer Society on prostate cancer screening is contained in the following guidelines: there is insufficient evidence that men's health will be advanced through prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men; prostate cancer is common and does, to a lesser extent, cause death; no prospective data is available to demonstrate quantifiable and reproducible reductions in death from prostate cancer due to screening of asymptomatic men by PSA or DRE, or both, at any interval&mdash;thus PSA or DRE alone, or in combination, cannot yet be recommended as screening tests for asymptomatic men either as a once-off examination or repeated at annual, biennial or some other interval; and men with symptoms suggestive of benign or malignant prostate disease should be assessed by a medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we come to the question: what will be the benefit of mass prostate cancer screening for men in Australia? The value of research has been identified by the Australian Cancer Society under the following points: an assessment of men's attitudes towards prostate cancer, their views of the purposes and limitations of screening programs and the value they place on years of life through malignant prostate disease compared to other significant causes of death and disability among men; the design, implementation and controlled evaluation of interventions to diffuse public and professional anxiety about prostate cancer screening in particular; the strategies needed to reduce unproven screening activity in general practice until stronger scientific evidence to support screening is forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 some $320,000 was provided for prostate cancer research. I do not believe that is anywhere near enough. As the current treatments cannot provide absolute answers as to the reasons why men develop prostate cancer and the difference in treatments can have emotional and physical side effects for the patient suffering from prostate cancer, we need to spend more time researching new methods of detection and treatment. The research undertaken so far has provided no evidence that a mass screening project for prostate cancer reduces mortality or increases life expectancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to the need for research is the need for a major education campaign targeting Australian males over the age of 50 to inform them that they are at risk and that they should consult their doctor for an examination. I hope this motion goes some way towards encouraging men in that age group and those who are asymptomatic to start looking after their health. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for moving this motion as it is an extremely important one. I am sure the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) will concur with the fact that we hear a lot of what could be called `me-tooism' when it comes to health issues, particularly research. In fact, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) was a little guilty of that last year when he  moved a motion calling for more funds for breast cancer research in which he compared the amount of money spent on such research with the amount being spent on HIV and AIDS research. I said in my speech then that they were both important and I say the same about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of older men in my electorate, knowing that I had a keen interest in breast cancer and was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs which was doing a report on that issue, asked, `Well, she's doing all this stuff about breast cancer, what's she doing about prostate cancer?' I went and talked to them and said, `Why don't you get off your backsides like the women have done and start lobbying for it?' That is exactly what the member for Cowper has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have known for years the problems they face with breast cancer. They have seen their mothers, sisters, cousins and daughters die from breast cancer and have said, `Enough is enough.' That is why I am very glad that we are now looking at this issue on its own and in its own right, particularly since the member for Cowper has told us that he has had this problem himself. Nothing focuses the mind more than that personal experience. I also think it is pertinent that he has focused on the two areas of research and education. This particular cancer is a different kind of cancer; every cancer is different, but this one has some peculiarities about it that are uncommon in other kinds of cancers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already heard about the age connection. The average age, we are told, for a prostate cancer patient is 73. Only one or two per cent of men under the age of 50 get it. The incidence increases with each decade of age. So when men are over 80 years of age, about 80 per cent of them have it. More than one doctor has said that more men in that age group die with prostate cancer than die of prostate cancer. That is another peculiarity because other cancers tend to act very quickly and kill very quickly. It is also not an easy cancer to treat. I am very thankful to hear that the member for Cowper had a successful treatment for his. I read in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia </EMPHASIS>that a cancer expert has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is cure necessary in those for whom it is possible? . . . Is cure possible in those for whom it is necessary?</PARA>
<PARA>That shows up the dilemma for many doctors. When Senator Herron was showing the standing committee some slides on breast cancer we raised this matter with him and he talked about the dilemma doctors have with patients, not knowing whether to treat them and how to treat them. There are particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support very much the call for more research. Research is needed in three specific areas: into causes, into screening and detection, and into treatment. I would like to touch briefly on each of those three areas. The causes in some cases, as in many cancers, is genetic&mdash;but I understand that in this case the predisposition is very slight. It has been said publicly lately that those doing research into breast cancer have just about isolated the gene that causes that hereditary strain but it will affect only about five per cent. It seems that men will be affected by prostate cancer for the same reason. On the causes, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cancer Dictionary</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some studies have shown that workplace exposure to cadmium, a metallic element used in welding, electroplating, and the production of alkaline batteries</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may increase the risk of prostate cancer. There is also some evidence that workers in the rubber industry may be at an increased risk. Diet may also play a role in the development of prostate cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Epidemiological studies suggest a link between the consumption of large amounts of animal fat and prostate cancer.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think too many people now who are realists will disagree with the latter cause in regard to any cancer&mdash;and a lot of other diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases. We know that one of the prime causes of lung cancer is smoking. We need to do more research on this subject. It is also interesting to note that Asian men have a much lower incidence of prostate cancer but when they come to live in a Western country the incidence goes up. Perhaps we need to look at their diet, their circumstances and their lifestyle and learn from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all other speakers have mentioned, the jury is still out on screening. We have developed successful screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer and men would like to know there is some screening they can have as well. Whether DRE and PSA&mdash;if we describe them as screenings&mdash;are effective is something we still have to find out. Hopefully, more research will show that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treatment options also need more research. The first option is to do nothing. There are some doctors who say that because of its slow growth and a particular man's circumstances&mdash;perhaps because of his age&mdash;it is better sometimes to do nothing. I would hate to be a patient in that position. Surgery, as we have heard, can be successful but it can also cause incontinence and impotence. Radiotherapy can cause problems to the bowel and the bladder. Hormone treatment can result in a loss of potency. So none of those treatments involves a foolproof method and no-one can say, `If you have prostate cancer have a particular treatment and it will all be fine.' We definitely need more research in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very interested that the mover of this motion talked about education. It is not just that men do not know where the prostate is or what it does; I think we would all agree that most men are very reluctant to go to the doctor. I will probably be criticised in some quarters but I think it goes right back to childhood when we were all playing in the backyard. When a little girl skinned her knee Mummy lavished her with sympathy, but when the little boy did the same he was told, `Big boys don't cry'; `You'll get over it'; `Be a man'; `Don't be a sook'; or `Don't be a sissy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those brave men that have grown up into adulthood are now also told to ignore those little nagging pains. They are told to ignore those symptoms that we have had read to us twice already about delay in urination, lack of pressure, dribbling and increased urge to urinate at night&mdash;which, incidentally, I can tell you from experience, is also another symptom of late onset diabetes. Some men might think that it is just a sign of ageing and say, `I am having a little bit of trouble when I go to the toilet,' without realising that is the case. So ignoring those early warning signs can be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is the case of someone I know of&mdash;a neighbour of my sister actually&mdash;who was thought of as a bit of a fussy person because whenever he went to the toilet he always looked in the bowl. One day he found some blood there, went straight to the doctor and found he had bowel cancer. So all his mates thereafter said, `Well, maybe he is not such a fussy old chook after all. Maybe he is someone who is looking after himself.' I suggest that all of us need to look at the early warning signs in all of those sorts of things in order to detect what is wrong with us. An education program is needed to get men to look for those signs and not to be afraid of going to the doctor and particularly having that digital examination, which we all agree is not very pleasant. Maybe we can also educate their wives to do a little gentle nagging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was impressed that, when the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) first took over her portfolio, one of the first statements she made was about men's health. She pointed out that men's health had not been focused on as an area of interest and that men themselves had not been forthcoming in saying, `We need some more money'; `We need some more research'; or `We need some more action on particular things.' For all those reasons I have just spoken of, men have tended to ignore signs and pretend they are not there. Of course, that also happens with some women. Some women have ignored a breast that is absolutely decaying until someone else has suggested they go for help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need an education program. I would be very happy to lobby the minister for health in that regard. Once again, I congratulate the honourable member for Cowper for bringing on this motion. I certainly commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for initiating this debate on prostate cancer. In doing so, he gives an example to other men who are generally reluctant to talk about their health and how it can be improved, let alone go along to their doctor for a general check-up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As Professor Marshall, head of the Department of Surgery at Flinders Medical Centre, puts it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been an education process going on in women's heath over the last thirty years and I guess it's only been in the last five that people thought we ought to be doing the same for men.</PARA>
<PARA>With an increasing ageing population there is an increasing number of men suffering from prostate cancer. It is typically diagnosed in men over 65 years of age and has been the subject of very little research. Physicians therefore lack the information they need in order to decide on the best management and treatment for patients. Because of this lack of research and data collection to measure outcomes there is disagreement between leading experts over how the disease should be managed, especially in its early stages, and whether many seemingly curable cases should be treated at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are important issues: first of all, more specific and therefore better serum markers for the detection of prostate cancer; secondly, improved methods for predicting progression of prostate cancer and the ability to discriminate between latent and clinical tumours; and, thirdly, finding alternatives to conventional forms of hormone therapy. Not only do we need research to be done on these issues; we also need to answer questions such as what causes latent cancers to progress and what causes prostate tumours to progress from hormone dependent to hormone independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my consultations in preparation for today's debate, I learnt that Dr Wayne Tilley from Flinders University in South Australia is one of only two leading prostate researchers in Australia. Wayne spent 3 1/2 years in Dallas, Texas, and is now back in Adelaide. His salary is being paid by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Wayne and other medical researchers are concerned, as indeed should be the general public, at the government's failure so far to stand by its 1993 election commitment to increase funding for health and medical research so that it reaches two per cent of the total health budget by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without good research to learn more about the biology of prostate cancer and how to treat it, screening will have little, if any, benefit. Wayne's team at Flinders currently has a grant proposal to the National Health and Medical Research Council. In literature he has provided to me it is described in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed invasive malignancy of men living in Western countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The usual treatment for advanced disease is to reduce or block the action of male hormones (androgens).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although therapy is often successful initially, most tumours begin to grow again within one to three years and there are currently no treatments available to stop the renewed tumour growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This study will examine how prostate tumours change from using androgens for growth to other growth factors, and specifically which growth factors tumours use when androgens are not present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A better understanding of how prostate tumours adapt to growing without androgens and thus become resistant to hormonal treatment could lead to better ways to treat this disease.</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be hoped that funds will be available for this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is to be condemned for its short-sightedness&mdash;the one election to the next syndrome&mdash;in planning for a healthier Australia. As I have said before in this place, we spend in excess of $34 billion treating people once they are ill. There are strong and convincing arguments that wise investment in medical research will save money in the long run in the delivery of health care. Professor Garnick from the Harvard Medical School has written at length about prostate cancer covering the debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do the risks of aggressive treatment for early prostate cancer outweigh the benefits? This question is one of several unresolved issues found by those who treat and those who have prostate cancer.</PARA>
<PARA>This article covers many aspects of this disease and argues the further need for prospective randomised trials and data collection. Professor Garnick also argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As women who have breast cancer know too well, the medical system does not deal particularly well with the psychological impact of threats to one's own self image and sexual activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Men who must consider sacrificing their potency in order to gain extra years of life should be given as much emotional support as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>It must be remembered that autopsy studies of men who die of other causes indicate that about one-third of men older than 50 have</PARA>
<PARA>some cancerous cells in their prostate. Professor Garnick estimates that three per cent of American men will eventually die of the disease. His paper concludes:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pressure is continually being placed on governments, both state and federal, and the ordinary taxpayer to fund an ever increasing array of groups each wishing to eradicate or at best dramatically cut the incidence of the disease they represent. Prostate cancer is a serious health issue for Australian men: 2,544 died from it in 1993. It has never been a disease rating up in the top 10. It has been under-researched and underfunded primarily because it has been seen as a disease affecting older men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have mentioned, an Australian male has a one in 23 chance of developing prostate cancer during his lifetime and a one in 70 chance of dying from it before the age of 75. In 1988 over 4,500 new cases of this cancer were diagnosed. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer&mdash;for both incidence and mortality&mdash;affecting Australian men after lung cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having recently been part of a House committee hearing into breast cancer, it is interesting to note some similarities when it comes to gaining statistical evidence to support or refute certain positions as to whether one form of treatment is any better than another. Any coherent and up-to-date statistical information often lies buried away in state departments and teaching hospitals across the country. No-one has yet come up with an effective way of collating and making these invaluable statistics available to state and Commonwealth health bureaucrats, hospitals, colleges and, more importantly, the local GPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders just how effective our health planning really is if we do not put something as vital as this in place in Australia. It is interesting to note that prostate cancer generally grows very slowly and many men die of other causes, unaware that they have also developed prostate cancer. Research shows that 30 per cent of men over 50 years of age have histological evidence of prostate cancer which was of no significance during their lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with most other major health problems facing our society, there is some uncertainty about what risk factors exist for prostate cancer. There is considerable disagreement over the best options for treatment and the cost effectiveness of mass screening for this form of cancer. I read with interest in this month's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS> in the article headed `Prostate Screening Could Ruin your Life' of concerns expressed by the Urological Society of Australasia on the issue of screening. In its valued judgment, there appears to be no clear benefit from screening for most men, despite a rise in the number of screenings occurring in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, many people&mdash;including many doctors&mdash;believe that screening asymptomatic men is the answer to prostate cancer. The cost of such a program would be at least $122 million annually. As previous speakers have stated, the most prominent of risk factors appears to be high levels of dietary fat consumption. As well, studies of the role of genetic factors have shown that men with affected relatives have an increased risk of developing clinical prostate cancer. Vasectomy also appears to confer an increased risk of developing this disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the other speakers have said, and as the honourable member for Cowper reiterated in great detail, we vitally need a better research and educative program in Australia.

But I now discover as a result of this debate that being in my 50th could be both risky and devastating. I found it very sobering in researching this speech to find&mdash;as the honourable member for Cowper was already aware&mdash;that 4,566 males were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1988 and that 2,554 men died of the disease in 1993. I was a little subdued by the comments of the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), who said that she saw prostate cancer as a disease of older men. Those of us in our 50th year do not actually happen to think of ourselves as older men, but I take her point. I also note the words of the honourable member for Cowper, who reminded me and all of my generation that it is time to be more diligent about the regular tests we take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful that others who have participated in this essential debate have avoided the temptation of drawing comparisons between the funding for research into prostate cancer and the funding for research into breast cancer. I think it would be quite improper for anyone to imply that the funding for one ought to be relative to the other. That would be an inhumane sort of comparison to draw. In fact, funding for both is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we want is a debate on health funding in Australia with suggestions that more money should be going here at the expense of some money going there. There ought not to be the sort of accounting where people say, `I have a concern. Therefore, I should receive more and, because of the amount of money you're receiving, your funding ought to be pruned.' In fact, the plea in this debate has been to ensure that all participants simply say that there is a need for additional research into all sorts of diseases currently facing the Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular vested interest in this debate because Mr Wayne Tilley, one of only two people doing major research into prostate cancer&mdash;and who was referred to by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth)&mdash;grew up on a property adjoining my property in the Riverland. We both went to the same school, although Wayne would be some 10 years younger than I am. I know Wayne well. I am conscious of the work he has done. I endorse the call from the member for Adelaide and the call from the Australian Cancer Society, a call that has been echoed by Dr Tilley, when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian men might be better served by directing extra funding to medical research, some of which could be directed to prostate cancer research.</PARA>
<PARA>The plea in this debate has not been specifically for a focus on prostate cancer but for a focus on the general concern we have of cancers and our lifestyle that causes cancers. In the case of prostate cancer, as many speakers have already indicated, it is difficult to find a case that would justify screening for it. As a parliament, the wisest thing we can do is to encourage more funding into general cancer research and encourage all men over 50 years of age to regularly visit their GP and be conscious of the symptoms of prostate cancer, as early diagnosis could prevent the fatal onslaught of it. Along with everybody else, I commend the member for Cowper for the interest he has shown in this particularly important area of cancer research. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join today in congratulating the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for raising this issue in the House. From the debate today, we have seen it is an issue of considerable interest across both sides of the House. It concerns me that it is a debate characterised by a lack of knowledge&mdash;not on the part of the members involved but on the subject matter. There is a lack of knowledge about the causes of prostate cancer, a concern about the accuracy of detection methods, the issue of a cost-benefit analysis for screening if we are to go down that track, and also the issue of public awareness. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cancer Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines the prostate as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one of the male sex glands located just below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It is about the size of a walnut and is wrapped around part of the urethra. It produces fluid that becomes part of the semen.</PARA>
<PARA>I for one can admit that I did not know that. Although I have heard of prostate cancer&mdash;or, as it is sometimes called, `prostrate' cancer&mdash;it is an issue that I did not really know very much about until I actually started doing some research for today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that were available in 1988 showed that 4,566 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. In 1993, 2,544 men died from prostate cancer. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that 6,261 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prostate cancer is predominantly a disease of older men, with less than one per cent of cases detected in men under the age of 50. However, the incidence increases with each decade thereafter with the result that 50 per cent of men over the age of 70 suffer from it. Obviously, the incidence of prostate cancer can be expected to continue to increase due to the general advances in medicine leading to a longer life expectancy. Prostate cancer is, therefore, clearly a major health issue for Australia to face now and particularly in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems faced in dealing with prostate cancer is the lack of research results regarding the causes. Age is obviously an important factor, which has been mentioned by a number of other speakers. Other risk factors which have been alluded to relate to diet, family history of other forms of cancer, occupational exposure to cadmium or radiation, sexual history such as number of partners and frequency of intercourse, and medical history such as vasectomy and benign prostatic hyperplasia. All of these issues have been raised as being potential considerations with respect to high risk. However, the prevailing view appears to be that more research is required to ascertain confidently the accuracy of existing studies. Only then can we ensure that high risk groups are identified and action taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of detection, two main procedures are used in the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer. The first procedure is the digital rectal examination, which is usually the most common screening technique. However, studies have shown that, in 30 to 60 per cent of prostate cancer cases, the physician will be unable to detect the tumour. The second procedure is the prostate specific antigen test, which is a blood test. However, this test can provide false positive and false negative results. An ultrasound technique is also available; however, according to the cancer dictionary, a biopsy `is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of the cancer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of screening was also alluded to by a number of speakers. There is considerable disagreement within the scientific community regarding the desirability of widespread screening programs. Again, this relates back to the uncertainty regarding causes and the problems with accurate, cost-effective and easy to perform detection measures for prostate cancer. There is also uncertainty regarding the value of mass screening programs. The view expressed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better health outcomes for Australians</EMPHASIS> is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "to date, there are no results from randomised controlled trials that screening for prostate cancer reduces mortality". The crucial point when considering mass screening is to draw a balance "between the morbidity and anxiety caused by unnecessary investigation and the likely clinical benefit to those men found to have prostate cancer".</PARA>
<PARA>I accept that there are alternative views on the question of mass screening programs, but I stress that we still need more research to ascertain the best approach to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that many men will have prostate cancer and will never require treatment. The death rate as a result of prostate cancer is less than 20 per cent. This contrasts with lung cancer, where 95 per cent of cases result in death. Public education remains an important issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I spent a very interesting day at Maralinga. It would be fair to say that the prime issue there was the prevention of cancer caused by the inhalation of plutonium. At the time I did not relate that to the issue of prostate cancer. At Maralinga, there is a $120 million program for the nuclear testing program and the clean-up afterwards. So great effort is involved there. I have focused on that matter for many years of my life, as I have lived in the area and have been aware of the royal commission and a whole range of issues surrounding the Maralinga tests. Prostate cancer affects far more people, but I only became aware of it when I did some work on it with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics in 1993 show that deaths from prostate cancer were 2,544 and that deaths from breast cancer were 2,641&mdash;a difference of almost 100. I think honourable members have canvassed very well various issues such as the genetic likelihood of getting cancer, diet and the effectiveness of screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join the debate with pleasure to highlight the need for an increased effort on this issue. We need awareness, and we have to discuss the education role and the legislative requirement. I suppose that is what is predominantly under debate. The financial arrangements may end up with some redirection of finance. I encourage the appropriate administrative arrangements which would achieve that. The practical issues will be managed by people much more expert than me. I thought the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) made a very good point. She mentioned the $34 billion that we spend on health. She highlighted the fact that we do not spend anything like what is reasonable in preventative health in that $34 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently we will spend something like $236 million in the next five years on breast cancer. As the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) highlighted, it is not a case of putting one ahead of the other or of one cause being greater than the other; it is perhaps a matter of highlighting an area that has been ignored for too long that is worthy of greater consideration. Prostate cancer is apparently not even listed in the budget index. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, breast cancer is the most common cause of death by cancer in Australian women, and prostate cancer is the second for men. Prostate cancer is fought with radiation or the scalpel and, with greater effort, perhaps we may uncover a range of other treatments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I would like to make quite clear is that the condition for which I had surgery in December was not cancerous; I am very lucky. I had the other form of the problem, a benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is an enlargement of the prostate. I think it should be well-known to all Australian males that, once they turn 50, half of them will have an enlarged prostate&mdash;so the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who has just turned 50, has a one in two chance of having an enlarged prostate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have been concentrating on the need for research into prostate cancer, allied with that is a very definite need for research into why the prostate enlarges from its normal size, which is about the size of a walnut, to the size of a lemon. That then carries with it the problems we are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my case I became aware of the need for treatment about 20 months ago when I learned that somebody that I knew had had prostate cancer. In his case there was some delay in the diagnosis and, as a result, he lost his testes and suffered the consequent dismay that that would cause any man. In that particular year he ended up having five sessions of surgery. I am highlighting these examples because I think it important for men and women to know what goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a relative by marriage in Queensland who is a pathologist, and he gives himself an annual pathology check. At the beginning of last year he did a PSA test and found that it was elevated to six. I might say that my PSA test after surgery was one, which is great. When he found his to be six he went to his GP. His GP did a digital rectal examination and said, `Oh no, that is clear; there is nothing there.' Three months later he did another PSA and found that it was up to seven. He went back to his GP who did another digital rectal examination and said, `She's right; she's clear&mdash;nothing there.' Three months later it was up to a PSA of 7.6. This time he insisted on having a biopsy, and the biopsy showed that he had advanced cancer of the prostate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why I urge Australian males, should they have symptoms, to make sure they go to see their GPs. They should not neglect it. Ultimately that particular relative of mine had surgery on 25 October last year. I spoke with him between Christmas and new year when he still had a catheter inserted and he was still wearing a bag strapped to his leg. He too had lost his testes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of problem faced by Australian men, and this is why I am so pleased that everybody who has spoken in this debate did the right thing and challenged all Australian men to take care of themselves and to seek more money for research. </PARA>

Yet, eligibility for a service pension is limited to those who served in operations against the enemy on land, sea or air, or in a situation of danger from hostile enemy forces. Those who are not eligible for a service pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs have found that even a disability pension is counted as income and therefore has the effect of reducing social security pensions. However, under the Veterans Entitlement Act, a disability pension is not regarded as income for service pension assessment purposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know about the expression `the real rate of interest'. Whether it be three per cent or four per cent or five per cent, this gets added on to the inflation rate. So the nominal interest rate is the inflation rate, plus the real rate of interest, plus the three or the four or the five. Is it any wonder with 11 per cent inflation underpinning the interest rate structure during Mr Howard's tenure of the Treasury benches that we had bank interest rates and bill rates in the teens, and finally in the early 20 per cents, with an inflation rate of 11 per cent following a wage break-out of 16 per cent? These are numbers that today people would just wonder at, a 16 per cent wage explosion followed by an 11 per cent ongoing inflation rate, accompanied by huge and massive rates of interest&mdash;as far as I know, the highest rates of interest in the postwar period in this country, by the former Treasurer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The technique is called `push polling', which is a technique pioneered by the extreme right wing Republican candidates in the United States. I believe this technique has been employed recently by the Liberal Party of Australia&mdash;both in the Northern Territory last year and in the ACT last week&mdash;and it works this way: the idea of push polling is to see if certain information can push voters away from the opposition candidate in support of the candidate favoured by the people paying for the poll. I concur with the judgment passed by David S. Broder who exposed this technique in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Washington Post</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>

They have admitted that the survey document was genuine, that it is theirs and that they surveyed 300 to 400 people in the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I stand up at any international forum, including this one, I will be able to say, without fear of contradiction, that Australia's rate of employment growth is, if not the highest in the Western world, one of the few highest in the Western world&mdash;one of the two or three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, we have had 25 per cent to 26 per cent employment growth since 1983. In 1983 we had a work force of six million. We now have a work force of over eight million. And the countries the opposition wishes to associate Australia with have employment rates&mdash;or people in employment today&mdash;which are barely more than they were in 1983.</PARA>

I will have no problem telling them about these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Were it to be my wont, I could tell them that the person who asked me the question believed that unemployment benefits should not be paid to these people after nine months&mdash;this was the policy he campaigned upon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have no problem telling them that he opposed all of the social measures that the government introduced over these years, basically, to ameliorate this international trend of that small group in the economy aggregating wealth, and to broaden it for the people at the bottom.

We get all of this from this shell of a party which, when it had control of both Houses of parliament, passed the parcel on every major social issue, including employment, competitiveness and opening up this country to make it more supple and to give people opportunities.</PARA>

What is the minister doing to ensure that CARE Australia is using taxpayer and public donations for the aid activities for which they have been given?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concern which the honourable member expresses over the allegations made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program is one shared by the government and me personally. We are deeply concerned about those allegations and, in particular, about the effect they might have&mdash;were they found to be true&mdash;on the whole non-governmental aid sector. As the honourable member knows from my visit to his electorate at the weekend, there are many good people who voluntarily give up their time and money to work for disadvantaged people in poor countries. I would hate to see the trust, which I believe is deserved by those organisations, forfeited as a result of something of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the specific allegations mentioned by the honourable member, most of them are currently being investigated as a result of action I took in October and November last year. They are currently being investigated by an independent firm of auditors, BDO Nelson Parkhill. In short, we were quick and thorough in our response to those allegations before they became public. Those allegations were first made by Mr Bernard Broughton in January 1991. At that time, AIDAB conducted a thorough investigation. It informed CARE Australia of the allegations and asked it for a response. As a result of the investigations then carried out, AIDAB was able to identify that at that time CARE Australia held surplus or unexpended funds totalling more than $400,000 in public moneys. Some of those amounts were repaid but the majority was reallocated&mdash;with the agreement of the government&mdash;to another activity run by CARE Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIDAB commissioned the New South Wales Auditor-General's office in May 1992 to undertake an audit of CARE Australia's financial regulations and systems, and its ability to meet the stringent requirements which we as a government place on financial reporting and acquittals of government moneys. That audit was finalised in June 1993. It concluded that CARE Australia's controls and systems were reasonable and sufficient to meet adequately disclosure of information guidelines, but it asked for some changes to be made. In view of the uncertainties about whether they would be made and whether they would be adequate, the auditors recommended a follow-up review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House that, at that time, the investigation was hampered by the unwillingness of Mr Broughton to make available any supporting documentation. In May last year, Mr Broughton reiterated his allegations to me and I immediately instructed AIDAB to investigate his claims. I also asked him at that time to hand over any documentation, any evidence, he had. He did so in July 1994 when his files were passed to the auditors, BDO Nelson Parkhill, who were at that time investigating the theft of vegetable oil from another project run by CARE. Those files were also handed over to AIDAB.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994, and in response to advice from the auditors that the Broughton documents contained sufficient detail to enable the allegations to be investigated by an audit, I approved expanded terms of reference for the audit so that the Broughton allegations could be fully investigated. So there have now been two major audits of CARE's systems. The second is still under way. I am absolutely determined that those allegations will be thoroughly investigated and finally put to bed one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform the House that there will be a meeting tomorrow between the government auditors and CARE Australia. I had a telephone call this morning from the Chairman of CARE Australia, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and he assured me that all documents would be made available to the auditors to ensure that the allegations could be properly looked into. On my instructions AIDAB has contacted Mr Ross Coulthardt, the reporter from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, and he has agreed to meet and cooperate fully with the government auditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making one or two remarks about the general question of accountability of aid organisations for the moneys they receive. As far as the government moneys they receive are concerned, many years ago we put in place requirements for comprehensive reporting on how government funds are spent as well as acquittals of expenditure once it is made. But donations from the public are in a different situation. The use of those donations is covered by a mishmash of laws, basically state legislation, relating to companies and associations. So it is very difficult to arrive at a situation where you can compare, for example, the amount which is spent by different aid organisations on administration. It is difficult to put in place a system of accountability for those donations as to where they are spent and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some system of accountability is essential. In September last year, I wrote to the Chairman of the Industry Commission inquiring into charitable organisations, Mr Bill Scales, and asked that the inquiry consider and report on the issues relating to accountability for public donations not only to domestic charities but also to those operating overseas. The draft interim report of the Industry Commission went into that issue in some detail. I again wrote to the Chairman of the Industry Commission on 17 February 1995 and said that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Tribunal has also been held not to be exercising judicial power in terms of its decisions.

Each of these cases was largely determined on its own facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government made the amendments to the anti-discrimination legislation in 1992 it did so in response to both community and judicial criticism of the current situation and adopted a recommendation proposed by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The advice given to the government at that time was that the scheme proposed in the amendments was constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been reports, as the honourable member suggests, that as a result of the High Court decision some thousands of decisions are now in jeopardy. This is incorrect, and it displays both a misunderstanding of the High Court decision and I think the processes of the human rights commission. While there have been well in excess of a thousand complaints made to the human rights commission since the amendments were made the vast majority of those have been settled through the conciliation processes of the commission. In fact I am advised by the commission that some 37 cases&mdash;and 37 alone, not thousands&mdash;may be directly impacted upon by the decision of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three issues which need to be addressed in response to the decision. Firstly, in terms of the enforcement proceedings, the government will be taking steps to immediately restore enforcement provisions in relation to the human rights commission. This will be done by amendments to a bill currently before the Senate dealing with the human rights commission and will see the reinstatement of the provisions which existed prior to the 1992 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue concerns the longer term problems. Clearly the same issues which led to the enactment of the 1992 amendments are still real problems. I have asked a review team which is currently looking into the human rights commission to examine this matter. This team, which is currently comprised of the Department of Finance, my department and the commission, will be supplemented by Dr Sue Kenny, the president of the Administrative Review Council; Chris Sidoti, a commissioner of the Australian Law Reform Commission and John Basten, QC, a leading Sydney silk on human rights matters. The committee will consult widely, but I have asked for it to report back to me within a period of three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue concerns those 37 cases where determinations have been made and where the High Court's decision has direct impact. It must be remembered that in all those cases it was open to respondents to take an appeal for a review to the Federal Court if they were unhappy with the determination of the human rights commission. It did not occur in all but I think one or two of those cases. We will not be refunding the money, but I have asked my department to work on a mechanism so that both respondents and complainants are placed as much as is practicable in the same position as they would have been if the amendments had not been enacted.</PARA>

I am pleased to see that a lot of our anti-smoking literature appears to be working.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for his question. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. Over five decades the Commonwealth-state housing agreement has been one of the foundations of social protection and care for those who are in most need. It is entirely appropriate that there should be genuine reform of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, particularly in the area of public housing. In the 1950s, in the early years of the agreement, there was a matching of public housing with the great industrial estates of the manufacturing industry. In the current period, public housing is targeted towards those most in need, with almost 90 per cent of all new entrants into public housing being people dependent on pensions or benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the meeting of state housing ministers last week, there was an agreement that more public housing should be provided, particularly where jobs are. So there should be a refocusing of housing assistance through redevelopment of the older housing estates and revitalisation of those areas, together with additions to stock, particularly in areas where there are high levels of job availability but very low levels of public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also agreed that state housing authorities should be much more focused on the management of tenants and on opening up more opportunities for choice on the part of tenants. Thirdly, states would be required under the new agreement to demonstrate that they are meeting national benchmarks, that these benchmarks should be published annually and the progress of the states in achieving under those benchmarks ought to be much more transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said, during the 1980s we have delivered some of the great reforms in social security. Few countries in the world have a more cost efficient social security system than Australia has, or one that is better targeted to those most in need. In the 1990s, as in the 1940s, we delivered a great and historic white paper on employment which attunes labour market training programs to the very best in the world. No country has a more adequate approach to labour market reform than this country. We have to match social security reforms and the orientation of social security to labour market re-entry, labour market assistance&mdash;the wherewithal that enables someone to succeed&mdash;and ensure that people can be located where the jobs are and where the opportunities lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply conclude by saying this: against our record of and our commitment to reform I remind the House that when John Howard left the Treasury there was a massive cut in public housing. The Liberals went to the last election planning to cut $400 million off the public housing budget. Honourable members would be aware that the Institute of Public Affairs&mdash;which, in the 1940s, was the think tank for the Liberal Party, and still is&mdash;was advocating $500 million be taken off public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast our record of reform, and the level of commitment and agreement we have achieved with the states for reform, with the irresponsible, insensitive approach of the opposition typified by John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, who, in his character, has shown no commitment at all to those who are most in need nor to ensuring that those who are most in need can be part of the mainstream of the Australian community. It is that continuing ideological commitment expressed in John Howard that contrasts with our record and the commitment we have to genuine and lasting reform.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. The government welcomed the agreement, which was reported in the press recently, reached between China and the United States on a package that is designed to protect the intellectual property rights&mdash;a package described by the United States representative as the most comprehensive agreement on intellectual property rights ever negotiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement will strengthen the enforcement of existing Chinese legislation against fraud, and it establishes a long-term plan for the protection of copyright, patents and trademarks. An effect of that is that it improves market access into China as a means of boosting the sale of genuine goods. The interests of both China and the United States have been served by this agreement. The United States has received guarantees on the protection of some of its fastest growing exports and, as far as China is concerned, its international reputation and ability to attract high level foreign investment have been enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threat of a trade war, in which we might have seen punitive tariffs of 100 per cent imposed on a range of Chinese imports by the United States and a corresponding response from China, has been averted. That would have had the most serious consequences for regional trade as well as for direct US-China trade. The prospect of that has already unsettled Asian markets and caused particular concern in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member asked about the importance of this for Australia. As the percentage of Australian exports of services and intellectual property rises, it becomes increasingly important to us that intellectual property rights are globally protected. The advice from our ambassador in Washington is that, other than for specific US-China joint ventures, that agreement will be implemented on a most favoured nation basis. That is important to us and we will be monitoring that aspect of the agreement.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1018" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question. In recent times, the opposition has repeatedly tried to portray the situation in this country as being one of the most inequitable in the world. I have answered a number of questions in this place in which I have refuted those claims. In fact, the evidence is quite clear that it is the reverse of the case. Those definitive and authoritative studies that have taken all relevant factors into consideration, including earned incomes, transfer payments through the social security system, social wage elements such as Medicare, education training, child care, et cetera, have invariably refuted the claims of the opposition in this area. In fact, they show a very high level of relative equity in this country compared with other countries in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, there has been throughout the developed world a trend for earned income differentials to increase. That phenomenon has not escaped Australia but all the evidence is that the impact of government policy on the outlays side and in terms of changes to the taxation system has been to mitigate and alleviate the underlying trend to greater earned income inequalities that permeates most developed countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If you look at the international statistics on earned income differentials&mdash;that is, even before you take into account the social wage and the transfer payment elements that we have talked about&mdash;the situation for this country relative to other countries looks pretty favourable. I refer honourable members to the OECD's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Employment Outlook </EMPHASIS>for July 1993 which contains a table on earnings dispersion for the year 1991. What that shows is that Australia has one of the least unequal distributions of earnings in the developed world, following the Scandinavian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of contrast, the measure of inequality is shown to be 50 per cent higher in the UK than it is in this country and 2 1/2 times higher in the United States than it is in this country. What that reflects to a considerable extent is the evidence that the countries that have shown the strongest trend towards inequality have been those that have gone down the road of wholesale deregulation of labour markets and the stripping away of anything that we would understand as award protection. This is precisely the policy of the opposition, plus totally regressive changes in the tax system through the income splitting that the Leader of the Opposition has talked about and through cutting social wage expenditures. Every element of coalition policy would have the impact of making Australia a less equitable society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are dealing with a case of sheer crocodile tears. The opposition obviously believes that by constant repetition of these claims it can gain some public acceptance. The reality is that the truth does not support the opposition. The objective evidence shows that this government, in its impact throughout its term, has had a major beneficial effect on equity in this society.</PARA>

In my seven-plus years in this place I have been provided with an opportunity to meet thousands of people whom I would not otherwise have met and I have visited hundreds of places in Australia that I never would have seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now feel that I have a significantly better understanding of Australia and what it means to be an Australian. I am particularly appreciative of the chance that the Liberal Party gave me to be a member of parliament and, importantly, to be its leader. I guess, if you look at my background, I was not a typical Liberal. In fact, being strictly honest, I tended to feel I was from the wrong side of the tracks. I had a Baptist working class background; I had a state school education; and I had parents who, in a formal sense at least, were relatively undereducated. In fact, nobody in my family had ever been to university&mdash;nor had they ever aspired to go to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I played rugby league and churches soccer; I didn't play rugby union or Aussie rules. So I often felt&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;as I was growing up that others seemed to get better opportunities. Their families seemed to know more important people and they seemed to get better access to the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that, irrespective of what I achieved personally in education both here and overseas or in employment, it was the Liberal Party that demonstrated to me genuine equality of opportunity. I remember very clearly that I did not have to know key people; I did not have to be a member of a key faction, like those on the other side; I did not have to do deals or sell my soul&mdash;I could just be me and run for preselection on my own merits and win. In being able to win the so-called blue-ribbon seat of Wentworth in the eastern suburbs of Sydney and then to become leader, I believe that I am living proof that the Liberal Party is for all Australians. For that I am particularly humbled and for that I will be eternally grateful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite what we as parliamentarians feel at times that we bring to our party, we should never forget that it is the party that put us there and gave us the jobs that we get to do. In my case, the Liberal supporters, under the Liberal banner&mdash;the people who hand out all the leaflets, who staff the polling booths, who provide and raise the money, who run the chook raffles and who argue our case in the pubs and clubs all over Australia&mdash;are the ones who put us there. We should never forget that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I guess the question that is on a lot of minds is: why have I decided to leave politics. I can assure you it is not a seven-year itch. I said at the outset of my time in politics that Carolyn and I would regularly reassess our role and the contribution that we were making, and that we would make that reassessment in the context of our personal circumstances at the time. It was very important to us that we were making a worthwhile contribution and that we were making a real difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For example, I stayed on after the last election, even though we had lost that election, because I felt I was best placed to keep the team together and to continue to fight for policy credibility. I stayed on after losing the leadership because I wanted to sustain the thrust of policy that I had started and I wanted to make sure that, to the extent possible, I would play my part in re-positioning the Liberal Party in a way that would win us the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now, Mr Speaker, the facts are simple: I no longer believe that I can make the contribution to federal parliament that I want to. Sadly, if I speak out on issues these days I am generally said to be destabilising; equally sadly, if I say nothing I am said to be occupying a space which I should vacate for others and it is suggested that I ought to get out. This not only disappoints me but, by God, frustrates the hell out of me. I personally offered to serve loyally under both Downer and Howard in senior economic portfolios. The rest is, of course, history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My mother used to say to me&mdash;and she said it time and time again until she was blue in the face&mdash;`For heaven's sake, John, sit still.' Well, I never could and I never will be able to. I am the sort of person who, if he is not being usefully employed, will go out and do something else. If I cannot make a difference in politics, I want to make that difference somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Politics to me has never been an end in itself. It has just been a means to a better Australia. I am not a time server. I was not here for the money, for the perks or for the superannuation payout. Indeed, in a way I have maintained my quiet protest about all of that by travelling in taxis rather than Commonwealth cars for the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The final consideration is that Carolyn and I are to have a baby in July and at my age, with 3 1/2 children, that could be quite an adjustment, even if I already do not sleep very much at night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look back over the time that I have had in politics, there were some early signs that should have warned me about the difficulties that I would have in a political career. I remember in my first election in 1987 we had a very large Young Liberal walking up and down the street with a sandwich board which had a poster of me on the front and back. He would walk down the middle of the street and I would follow along knocking on doors and introducing myself to people as we went along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember one particular fellow who was working on his car. He was underneath his car on one of those dollies&mdash;the little wheels that slide in and out. I had noticed as I was coming along that he had looked up and seen the poster go by. So I bent down and said, `Hi, I am John Hewson, I am standing as the member for Wentworth.' He looked at me; he looked at the poster; and he said, `I think I prefer the bloke in the poster.' So there was an early warning of my capacity as a salesman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before the 1993 election I was brought back to earth when I was warned how difficult it can be to have an impact in this business. I had had nearly three years of saturation publicity as the leader. I went to a business meeting in Melbourne. I turned up and I was greeted on the ground floor by a girl behind the desk who, when she saw me as I came in, got quite enthusiastic&mdash;`Good to see you. Glad you're here.' Then she paused and said, `Look, is your christian name John or Robert?' Both John and Robert are my christian names. I said, `My first christian name is John.' So she picked up the phone and said to somebody upstairs, `I've got John Keating down here to see you.' That was a double insult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third episode&mdash;and I will be brief&mdash;was when my great mate Brian Doyle the comedian pointed out to me pretty early on the hopelessness of my timing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This speech offers me an opportunity to seriously but briefly reflect on my time in politics. I would like to do that by going back to when I started to get interested in politics in the late 1960s. I left Australia, in fact, in 1968 to study overseas. At that time, to be honest, I had some real doubts about Australia and where Australia was headed. I had a real confidence that government was the answer, basically, to our economic and social problems, that government could provide the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was part of a generation that tended to leave university anyway and go into government believing that we could save the world. In those days I was more inclined towards Labor ideals than Liberal ideals; but by the time I returned at the end of 1974 early 1975, I was a reborn believer in Australia. I had some very genuine and serious doubts about government as a solution to any of our economic and social problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I was concerned that an excessive reliance on government was a large part of the problem as distinct from a solution in many instances. That sort of change of heart came from a whole host of factors. Just living and working overseas is an important education in itself. But I had been fortunate in the IMF to work on a whole range of issues: things like hyper-inflation in Brazil, which was substantially due to government profligacy; credit and monetary systems in Korea and Asian countries, again bringing similar lessons; forecasting the US economy; and forecasting the Canadian economy at a time when it was the renegade&mdash;it was floating its exchange rate and deregulating its financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did a lot of work in theoretical and empirical terms looking at the way the world worked and how government interference in controls and impediments tended to distort the flow of money, goods and people, add to costs and increase inefficiencies. So I came back with a pretty clear-cut shift in my thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Philosophically, the key shift for me was the recognition of the true significance of the supremacy of the individual. It led me, when I looked at economic issues and economic policy, to try to develop economic systems that would give individuals maximum freedom to serve their personal, business and family interests, and give them maximum opportunities and equal opportunities&mdash;a system where their efforts would be genuinely and accurately rewarded and where the efficiency of the system would be maximised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This did not rule out a role for government of course; it is an important role for government. But it was a lesser role than existed in most countries in the world at that time. It combined to really providing a framework in which market forces would operate but protecting those who really did not have equal access, or who could suffer from the development of the system&mdash;the consumers, the disadvantaged. It is important for government to ensure the equality of access while providing a framework in which market forces can operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The individual in that process though, however, is supreme. The government is subservient except, of course, when individuals collectively choose otherwise. In social policy again it leads me, and has led me, to see the individual as supreme. So I do not have any problem myself with issues that relate to women's rights or gay rights as they are called, to seeing abortion as a matter of choice for a woman in conjunction with her family and her doctor, to supporting legislation in relation to privacy or anti-racial vilification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are always constraints; there must be. In the case of the latter, such legislation protects free speech, and gives proper recognition to the status and rights of Aboriginal people. It explains why I took the strong positions I did on issues such as female genital mutilation, mental illness and breast cancer research. In terms of the political spectrum, I was to the right of centre in economic matters and to the left of centre in social policy matters. I never saw economics or politics as an end in themselves or as a science. They have scientific elements but, basically, they are an art where judgment is fundamentally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I returned to Australia, I returned with a passion for change. I was conscious that Australia was going to have to operate in very difficult economic circumstances and increasingly difficult social circumstances. The growth and stability of the sixties had gone. Oil prices had quadrupled in one year. The Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates had broken down and people were not sure where they were going. The days of low inflation and low unemployment had gone and governments had resorted to big budget deficits, price and wage controls and so on. Yet Australia at that time was an isolated, inward-looking country. It was predominantly still an Anglo-Saxon country, very introspective, and heavily regulated and dominated by government. Yet we were expected to make our mark in an increasingly competitive, integrated and unregulated world economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to see Australia move quickly to position itself in that process of change and to capitalise on that change. But, as I have said, my passion was not for politics but for making a difference. Politics was not an end in itself but a means to an end. As I have said many times, good economics and good policy would be good politics with probably a pretty short lag, even though I lost an election arguing that case. Certainly the reverse is true. Bad policy is going to be bad politics. Bad governments get thrown out. In the end, I think the people of Australia simply want their problems to be solved. We should never forget that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my early days in politics, I was a staffer under Philip Lynch and then John Howard. I was very proud of my role in trying to force the debate in favour of deregulation of the financial system and towards lower protection. Might I say that the two great successes of the last 20 years in economic policy in Australia have been in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emergence of bipartisan support for lower protection has been a fundamental plus. A lot of the credit goes to the Labor Party in respect of that. It is a fundamental plus for Australia, although the job is yet to be completed. In relation to deregulation of the financial system, again, the credit must be shared between Liberal and Labor. The job is still to be completed but what a huge improvement there has been. More than anything else, that has been driven by unions, employers and others starting to focus on the nature of labour relations in this country and the need to have internationally competitive labour market structures. Everybody is now talking about enterprise bargaining but, 10 years ago, only one side of politics was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over this time there have been some very important shifts in the debate but, most importantly, there has been a greater uniformity of view. The debate today is not so much about the direction of policy as it is about the pace and the substance of that change. To use one example, the days where the Labor Party argued for expanded budget deficits and we argued for contracted budget deficits have long gone. Fightback was an exercise to try to capitalise on that growing uniformity in the policy debate and to hopefully complete the process of reform that had been started in the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback was a very broad based economic and social agenda. It was based on several beliefs. I guess the fundamental belief was that, in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years, we could argue and convince enough people of the need for significant change to win an election. Secondly, we believed that, in the aftermath of our policy positions in 1987 and 1990, we needed to build credibility again as a party that clearly stood for something in economic and social policy&mdash;to get out in front to set the agenda and to challenge the vested interests. Thirdly, there was a belief that, with minority parties holding the balance of power in the Senate, we needed to supply a fair degree of detail. We needed to get a mandate if we wanted to govern. We would not be able to govern if we had to negotiate every single piece of legislation through the parliament, as we have seen in the case of the government since 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our failing was that we underestimated the politics of fear and misrepresentation. We underestimated that the politics of fear and misrepresentation could beat the politics of reason and the substance of policy. We failed to match the ALP on the ground. I personally do not think there is anything wrong with the policy direction we took to the last election. It can be extended. In some cases it can be changed. In some cases it can be improved. It was not the policy that was wrong; it was the way that I and others sold it and, therefore, failed to match the ALP and the union movement on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Winning is important but to me it is not everything. How you win is at least as important. I am as disappointed as anyone else&mdash;and probably considerably more disappointed&mdash;that we did not win in 1993. I desperately wanted to win for the sake of the Liberal Party and for the sake of Australia. I did all I physically and intellectually could to secure that victory, but I was not good enough. I accept that reality without any rancour and without any sour grapes but, naturally, with a considerable amount of regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud that I did not resort to lies and deceit or to the gutter to get us across the line. We teach our kids about honesty and integrity&mdash;shouldn't our choice of role models back this up? I just did not want to win for the sake of winning. People say that I should have left Fightback in the bottom drawer and brought it out after the election. It is true that we might have won if I had done that, but we would not have been able to govern. With the minority parties holding the balance of power in the Senate, we could not have trotted out a post-election surprise like Fightback and expected them to support it. We needed to argue the mandate up front. Most importantly I would not have been able to live with myself if we had kept it in the bottom draw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told my preselectors I wanted to do things differently, make significant changes, stand for policy not politics and raise political standards. I had set the parameters and I operated within them. I certainly did not want to be Prime Minister just for the title or for the opportunity to live in the Lodge. I wanted to be Prime Minister only if I could implement our program, which I knew would make a difference&mdash;not to wallow in the trappings of that great office or worry about my place in history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud of what we stood for and I am proud of the way we did it. I rest peacefully at night absolutely sure that the people of Australia will have the final word; they will exact their revenge on those who lied to them and on those who attempted to frighten them. This, as much as anything else, will ensure that John Howard and the coalition win the next election. They will win that election&mdash;and I will back them all the way in the election contest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also proud that Fightback gave us as a party and as a coalition the greatest unity we have ever had. It gave us our greatest policy credibility. It is the first time ever an integrated economic and social policy has been developed in a way that was fundamentally consistent with our philosophical beliefs. My final comment on Fightback would be to say that I have a greater understanding these days of what John Kennedy meant in his Bay of Pigs press conference when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's an old saying that victory has a hundred fathers, defeat is an orphan.</PARA>
<PARA>To summarise my role in all that, I would quote the American poet Robert Frost:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I came across two paths in the woods today and I chose the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to show any sensitivity about not being an effective politician but I guess it depends on what your criteria are. In my time as leader we got one Prime Minister, three Treasurers, the Godfather, the New South Wales Right, two other ministers and an ambassador. That is not a bad track record if you count scalps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of being further accused of being politically naive and politically inept, I want to make one point before I give some thankyous. That is: look to the future. I appeal to this parliament and to the people of Australia to try to take a less political view of some fairly fundamental issues that are before us as a nation at the present time. There is a very important lesson from the past that we should never forget: you cannot tweak our economic and social system. It must be transformed. It must be subjected to broad based reform in our political circumstances as we find them today. This is particularly true if we as a nation are going to reach our full potential in the Asia-Pacific region, and particularly when we look at how fast and how quickly those countries are growing and changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our biggest challenge today is to recognise that our political system is not really conducive to that broad based reform for a number of reasons. I guess politicians on both sides of this place are still a bit shell shocked about the result of the 1993 election. Looking at it from a policy point of view, people are hell-bent on trying to avoid detail or taking clear-cut positions on key issues. Yet ironically, with the minority parties dominating the Senate and neither side likely to have control of the Senate in the foreseeable future, unless you have a clear mandate you are not going to be able to govern&mdash;you are going to have a gridlock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an incessant focus on politics today rather than on policy substance. This has three effects. The first is that short-sightedness or myopia is introduced into the debate. People leave this place of an afternoon and race out to ring up Laurie Oakes to see how they went in question time or they look to tomorrow's headline; maybe at a stretch they look to the next budget or the next election. Yet we are competing in a region where our competitors think in terms of decades or generations at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is that the political process today is dominated by polls and by what key commentators like Oakes, Lyneham or others say in their editorials or columns. There is not that much focus on whether people are saying what is right and doing what is right to solve our problems. Politics is one of those very strange businesses. It is probably one of the few businesses where you can think you had a good day and where you can do what you think is right, only to look at television that night or the headlines the next day to find out that you actually stuffed up pretty badly. You have so little control over what happens to your position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third is that the noisiest minorities today are having the biggest influence on government and policy. Those who can mount an effective campaign are having that influence. Without taking a view of the loggers, I demonstrate the case that encircling this place with trucks so the Prime Minister cannot get to work tends to focus his mind. I long for the day that the tax reform debate sees the business community and others lead a similar revolt to get genuine reform in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is very simple: we desperately need to step back from all this and find some way, on the bigger issues at least, to depoliticise the process and to find greater opportunities for a bipartisan approach to some of the bigger issues. Some issues are clearly bigger than any of us as politicians, and they are too important in many cases to be left to politicians. The lives of issues often transcend the lives or the terms of many politicians so their solutions can be readily lost in a succession of myopic politicians playing interminable political games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, the stability of the 1950s and 1960s was shattered in the early 1970s. We are now 20 to 25 years on and we have not made any significant improvement in dealing with some of those problems. Every time we have gone around the economic cycle we have come out with higher interest rates in real terms; higher unemployment and higher long-term unemployment; bigger balance of payments problems and bigger debt; and a greater intensity of a whole range of our social problems, be they homelessness, youth suicide or whatever. We simply cannot go on like this. It may be that we need political reform and reform in the attitudes in this place before we get substantial reform and response to some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, the main long-term issues that face us today which are desperately in need of a bipartisan approach, or a less political approach, are: how we resurrect the whole issue of broad based economic and social reform, including tax reform now we have had the experience of the 1993 election; how we formulate a successful national savings strategy, in particular a national savings and superannuation scheme that guarantees that when people get to retirement they are going to be adequately protected; how we properly reform our constitution not only to deal with issues like the republic but also to give proper recognition to our Aboriginal people and their heritage without creating division or discriminatory rights; how to properly allocate expenditure and taxing responsibilities to the three levels of government; how to shift from the current focus; and, finally, and another really important issue, how we are going to shift from the current focus of cutting immigration&mdash;which, in effect, is almost a moratorium on immigration today&mdash;to recognise the significant need in this country to dramatically expand immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give some thankyous to those who have been important to me in the last seven years of my political career. I have already mentioned the role of my supporters in the party and, more broadly, in Australia. I thank them. I have spoken to many of them in my electorate over the last few days. I greatly appreciate the contribution and self-sacrifice they have made on my behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group I should thank is my staff. I have been blessed with a very loyal and dedicated staff who have been prepared to put in 18 to 20 hours a day. In fact, when putting together Fightback, I remember some of them going without sleep for two to three days. It is that sort of dedication and commitment that I greatly appreciate in terms of my experience in this business. You are, in the end, substantially only as good as your staff. You never want to underestimate their importance. I want to formally thank them all. Many of them have come back and are in the gallery today. I thank you very much for the contribution that you have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To my family, I thank my father and his friend Jan. I only wish my mother could have lived to see my seven years in  politics. I think it would have made a big difference to her. I thank Carolyn's parents, Chris and Jude, and her sisters, Prue and Erica. I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous support and encouragement of my brothers, Lindsay and Greg, and their wives, Anne and Barbara, and of my sister, Nerida, and her husband, Greg. They have really lived and breathed every second of the last seven years. Although we feel it when we receive some flack, sometimes we forget that the family feels it more. When they get written up in the paper, they really feel it. When they get misrepresented, they feel it that much more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my children who are here today&mdash;all 3 1/2 of them&mdash;I am delighted that you have been so supportive and so committed to the cause that I tried to fight for. They have given so much of their personal time and energy to that cause. To Carolyn, I wish to say a special thank you. Nobody could have had a better friend and adviser. My father often said to me when I was a young fellow, `When you choose your wife, you should see that she has good health, good teeth and that she is a good cook.' In Carolyn's case, two out of three is not bad. She is not a great cook. The key point is that my father never really foresaw&mdash;this is not a fault of his but a fault of his times&mdash;the extent to which women would improve their standing in Australian society. He never foresaw the well educated, articulated career woman that Carolyn is. She has been a great source of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my friends such as David Harley and others who are here, thank you for your support. They live and breathe this as well. I have been appreciative of having friends on both sides of this House. That is not rare perhaps, but I greatly value the friends I have on both sides of this parliament. To my colleagues, the government and the media&mdash;I am inclined to put you all together; I do not know how to characterise this because I know that you have all been waiting for me to say something&mdash;the best thing for me to do is to quote that well-known Redfern poet Jeff Fenech: `I love youse all'. I just love some of you more than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been so much written over my political career&mdash;most of which I have not read but I have been told about&mdash;about what has influenced me, on whom I have modelled myself and about what people have had a significant influence on the development of my ideas, thoughts, career and so on. I thought I would finish with just three quotes that summarise some of those influences. The first is from John Maynard Keynes, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.</PARA>
<PARA>I would say `some defunct Fightback economist'. Secondly, when judging my role in politics, I was always impressed by what Kennedy said of the opportunities that the US presidency gave him. I think they apply particularly in Australia today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those to whom much is given, much is required. And when at some future date the high court of history sits in judgment on each of us, recording whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the state, our success or failure, in whatever office we hold, will be measured by the answers to four questions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, were we truly men of courage?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, were we truly men of judgement?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, were we truly men of integrity?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, were we truly men of dedication?</PARA>
<PARA>I rest easy in my political career in answer to all four of those questions. Finally, there is a quote from Theodore Roosevelt which I think my mother could have written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doers of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred with dust and sweat; who strives valiantly; who errs and may fall again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who does know the great enthusiasm, the great devotion; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold or timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 election was one that the member for Wentworth dwelled upon. He put his policies into the public marketplace. That is something I would urge upon his successors. He never sought to camouflage his policy. The fact that I thought it was wrong and that I thought it sought to upset the egalitarian consensus in this country was something on which the public made its judgment, but it was there to debate. If nothing else, it put into the marketplace all the things that the Liberal Party believed about income distribution, employment, education and the tax system. It said, `That's what we stand for,' and then the Liberal Party went out and campaigned for it. It was probably the best funded election campaign ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the redeeming element of the election was that the notions of egalitarianism and fairness in this community are now substantially embedded.

In fact, I think the public understood it well. Basically, in their view it was a view of survival of the fittest in that they thought an unconscionable shift of wealth from the middle and low paid to the wealthy was not worth having.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have known John Hewson for longer than many other people in this chamber. John worked for me from 1977 when I became Treasurer until the defeat of the Fraser government in 1983, and through all of that time he was an extremely hardworking, intelligent and committed employee of the government. He sacrificed a great deal during that time, and I want to place on record my personal thanks to him for what he did during that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say without any fear of contradiction that during that period of time John became not only an adviser but a close personal friend of mine, a friendship that for my part I hope endures into the future. We related to each other in different fashions: he was first an employee of mine, then we saw each other but infrequently, and then in 1987 he became a parliamentary colleague. He became a shadow minister and then shadow Treasurer, and I became the backbencher. He then became the leader and I became his shadow minister, and I spent the period between 1990 and 1993 wanting to be nothing other than his minister for industrial relations in what I hoped would be a Hewson-Fischer coalition government. Subsequently we became opponents for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and then we became leader and colleague. Now I am the leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party, a party of which I know John will remain a member at an organisational level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Politics confers on only a few people the immense privilege of leading a political party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech, in his summary of the economic changes facing Australia, I believe John made a number of very salient points. I agree completely with him that in many respects the two landmark economic achievements of the past 10 or 15 years have been financial deregulation, which was a matter of bipartisan consent&mdash;and bipartisanship on that occasion made it possible&mdash;and the tariff reduction program which I have always given the government credit for. It was not an easy thing for the government to do given the nature of its own constituency. There is of course a very large shoe that remains to drop in the economic area, and that is the issue of labour market reform. Unfortunately for Australia it will take a change of government for that great reform to the Australian economy to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with what John said about the importance of receiving a mandate. It is important that what you seek to do after you are elected is what you have told the public beforehand that you intend to do.

I will never forget the outcome of that particular formal diplomatic session.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill were passed in this place taking money off states that passed legislation giving university students the choice of whether or not they joined their guild. The federal government did this despite those states having a mandate from the people to return choice to students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, if any students exercise their right to choose not to join their student union, the federal government will give the equivalent of the fees lost to the guild, with that money being deducted from grants to states. So what we will have is less money for roads, hospitals, schools, police and so on while the guilds, which are more often than not politically aligned, will continue to thrive without the need to be accountable, representative or bipartisan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer the House to a number of examples which show that taxpayers' money is being wasted on these student guilds when it would be better spent on roads, hospitals, schools and police. The University of Western Australia guild in a recent edition of its newspaper carried an article&mdash;as a suggestion to earn money&mdash;advocating violence, befriending an old person to inherit their money, prostitution and selling body parts, to name but a few examples. Some people may suggest this is humour but, if so, it is pretty juvenile humour, and it is wrong if such trash is going to be published to expect the taxpayers to publish and finance it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the guilds want to publish this, they should do it with their own funds collected via the voluntary contributions of members who choose to join. That way students opposed to funding this rubbish can protest by withdrawing their membership. With compulsory membership they could not register such a protest. Now, even though the states have ensured choice to make guilds representative, the federal government has said to the guilds, `Don't worry, we will guarantee your funding, so now you can continue on your merry way of being unrepresentative and politically biased.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the Murdoch University guild's newspaper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Metior</EMPHASIS>, which is politically biased, full of juvenile humour&mdash;or what is expected to pass as juvenile humour&mdash;and does not provide any valuable information to students. Take its horoscope page. Here is a selection of quotes for some of the stars: `You will smut your best friend's sister's father's cousin which will cause the breakup of your friendship'; `Well rough me up with the exciting end of a cucumber'; `A month of major lubrication looks likely'; `You will not get a fornication in the foreseeable future.' The paper used a different `f' word, but I substituted `fornication' as a more parliamentary usable word with a similar meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyhow, the horoscope goes on with other similar rubbish which some might consider humour but, even if it is, it is not worthier of funding than the states' essential services which are being deprived of funds to pay for this sort of nonsense. There is one more horoscope which I find most offensive, as would the colleague to whom it refers. Under the star sign of Leo, the author says, `I had sex with Carmen Lawrence and she was quite disappointing.' I do not think the honourable minister would lower herself to have anything to do with the author of this rubbish. Even if it is humour, it is offensive and denigrating to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, members opposite cannot complain because they voted last year to fund that trash ahead of roads, hospitals and other such services. The final publication, but certainly not the last piece of trash which members opposite voted last year to divert taxpayers' money to, is an Edith Cowan University booklet called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weird Sisters</EMPHASIS> with an article entitled `The subversive politics of . . . ' I cannot give the entire title because it goes beyond the pale. The article talks about female genitalia and describes how women are taught to envy long brown legs, tight smooth arses and round lifted breasts, but were never informed of the ideal&mdash;and the House can work out the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite think that all these activities are worthier of taxpayers' funds than education, roads, hospitals and police. When the government sits down for the budget to cut spending, the first place it could start is with the university guilds, which are ever so wasteful of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn my attention to an issue of concern to a group of constituents in my electorate known as WISE, Women's Implant Support Exchange. I was introduced to the complex social, medical and legal issues confronting recipients of breast implants over 18 months ago when I was approached by members of the Women's Implant Support Exchange, which is a consumer support group based in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internal breast augmentation was considerably established in Australia with the use of silicone prosthesis in the 1960s. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 Australian women have had breast implants. The implants were used in reconstructing a new breast following mastectomy or for correcting breast abnormalities as well as for general breast augmentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not understand why women took that course of action in the cases of augmentation, the issue here is that many of these women are now suffering disfigurement, injuries and medical problems. These women are suffering because, as recipients of breast implants, they were unprotected as a result of failures in regulating and reporting procedures which allowed these faulty products onto the Australian market in the first place. They were exploited by implant manufacturers who possessed knowledge that silicone implants were not safe but remained silent for years whilst they continued to market and sell their implants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implants from manufacturers mainly based in the United States were released untested onto the Australian market and were sold here for over 20 years. If regulation and reporting procedures had been effective, the problems associated with breast implants would have been discovered and thousands of women saved from disfigurement, injury and possible crippling disability. This has highlighted the need to regulate all future use of breast implants and implantable devices. Pre-market surveillance, the establishment of a consumer register and the provision of informed consent should be viewed as essential steps to be taken in the regulation of implantable devices. Additionally, mechanisms for an effective reporting scheme for device failure must be in place to prevent this sort of issue being repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For over 20 years, Australian women believed, and indeed were told, that breast implants were safe and that they would last them a lifetime. Had the truth been revealed, these women would have been informed that the average lifespan of the older type implants is around 10 years, while the newer implants with the thinner wall lasts only four to seven years. What follows is that the porous outer shell eventually disintegrates, spilling silicone into the body, and it has been established that the silicone is linked to various health problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian and Canadian lawyers have been representing breast implanted women from their respective countries in the United States in a class action against the manufacturers of breast implants. Despite objections from those lawyers, the presiding judge in the proceedings approved a settlement which only permits women in countries other than the United States to share three per cent of the proposed $6 billion global settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the Australian women to decide whether they wish to opt into the global settlement. There is no logical basis for the three per cent ceiling, and the US lawyers who negotiated this settlement have not acted in the interests of all women. Regrettably, the only available option at this stage is for Australian women to opt into the three per cent global settlement. Otherwise there is no recourse available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian women are outraged and feel that this is the final blow in the chain of events which has caused thousands of them to be treated as worthless objects. The Canadian government has engaged lawyers in the United States aimed at assisting an appeal against the judge's decision and, in so doing, supporting the female citizens of its nation. I appeal to our government to look at assisting the women of Australia, who are facing a similar injustice, in whatever way it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to mention a recent story on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program on Channel 9. This story concerns a back surgeon in Western Australia, Dr Philip Hardcastle. Dr Hardcastle was the victim of a vicious story on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> which was full of untruths, false allegations and personal smears against Dr Hardcastle in another example of the tall poppy syndrome. I am saying this not after speaking to Dr Hardcastle, but after being contacted by many patients who were disturbed at the gutter attempts by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> to smear one of Australia's best back surgeons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members need only cast their minds back to the last Ashes test match between Australia and England to learn of the doctor's skill. Craig McDermott walked off one afternoon in terrible back pain; the next day, after being attended to by Dr Hardcastle, he wiped the floor with the Poms. Further proof of Dr Hardcastle's ability can be obtained from the likes of Bruce Reid, Bruce Yardley and Bob Simpson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this hatchet job by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> was prompted by an action group whose members were seeking compensation after having been injected with Depo-Medrol. They launched a smear campaign against Dr Hardcastle because he testified that the injuries to the members of that action group, who were seeking compensation, were blown out of all proportion. In return for him being honest, they set up a group with the sole intention of destroying Dr Hardcastle. Dr Hardcastle has been revolutionary in back surgery in Australia. He has recently introduced a new method known as the GRAF system. Because he told the truth about a few compensation claimants they set up a group with a vendetta to get him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had Depo-Medrol injections myself, and knowing the pain that one incurs in the back, I can understand the desire of such people to have their problems fixed. Nevertheless, they have no right to dish up a story to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> falsely trashing Dr Hardcastle. Similarly, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> was totally unprofessional in its airing of the story. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> edited the story with one intention: destroying Dr Hardcastle. The old adage `Do not let the truth get in the way of a good story' certainly came to the fore in this instance. Since the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> story, Dr Hardcastle has unfairly lost business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance is with the New South Wales government and in particular the Road Traffic Authority. To be fair to the Road Traffic Authority, may I firstly pay it a compliment for the support it has given to the RTA New South Wales Big Bike Ride. By coincidence, the ride will be starting this Saturday and touring through my electorate for a period of 10 days. It will bring in about $1 million to the electorate. I would point out that it was my hard work which won that event for my area. The benefits that will be achieved by small business and the people of my area are attributable to my efforts. I very much appreciate the sponsorship of the RTA because it recognises that those with motorised vehicles are not the only users of the roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turning to other matters, I wish to refer to the Minnamurra Bends. I apologised to this House for comments I made to a few local aldermen who considered that it was not correct to approach the RTA and give it curry for its lack of integrity in relation to road improvements in the Kiama area. Although this should be essentially a state and local government issue, I raise it in this House because within my files I have representations from people at the far south end of my electorate. The electorate of Gilmore extends from Kiama to a beautiful place called Depot Beach near North Durras which is within 10 kilometres of Batemans Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The representations are from tourist operators and are along these lines: `Dear Mr Knott, can you do something about this Liberal state government in regard to the congestion on the roads at Kiama? It has been stated again and again by our clientele&mdash;whether they be motel accommodation seekers or caravan park seekers&mdash;that on any Sunday it takes at least two to three hours to cover five kilometres of road.' In itself, that may not seem to be a great problem, but we must understand that a large portion of my electorate owes its survival to the tourist trade and to the ancillary economic activity which is fostered by the tourist trade. A major deterrent to people coming to our area is of great concern to the whole of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I live in the Kiama area, and I frequently take a bus up there to speak to people in the electorate. A man named John Wain suggested to me that I should organise a blockade on the Princes Highway adjacent to the Minnamurra Bends. Why has this come about? It has come about because the New South Wales state Liberal government under Mr Fahey will only put money into electorates held by Liberals or which are Liberal or National Party marginal electorates. Thus we have this great constriction on the economic development of the electorate of Gilmore. A previous speaker suggested that state governments should be spending their money on roads, hospitals, schools and police. I could not agree more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under the 1990 heads of government agreement between the Commonwealth and the states the assumption was made that there would be equitable distribution of funds and that the premiers would not use the funds in a party political fashion. That has not been the case in my electorate. Our schools have been underfunded, our hospitals have closed and we have had no funding for our roads. The electorate of Bega adjoins my electorate. What has happened there? That electorate has more than enough dollars. It would be remiss of me not to sheet home the blame to those responsible. The New South Wales government is responsible for the shoddy and tawdry way in which it has administered the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I wish to raise is main road 92. Main road 92 is now a dirt road, but it has quite exceptional bridges. I am not noted for praising the wonderful administration of the Shoalhaven City Council, but in this case I must. The council had the foresight to put in bridge structures which would enable main road 92 to be functional if it was surfaced. I had a large number of representations on this matter and I approached the Premier of New South Wales. I expounded the benefits to tourism by linking us to Canberra, the benefits to manufacturing by linking us to Canberra and the benefits for incoming raw materials to producers and manufacturers in my area, but the Premier's comment was `Not in your lifetime, son.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look at the priorities for funding roads throughout New South Wales. One would have thought that something that had a massive amount of regional economic impetus behind it, which would lead to a regional area of New South Wales clawing ahead&mdash;it being one of the fastest growing residential areas in the state&mdash;would be embraced by the premier. Did he? No, he did not. He said, `Not in your lifetime, son.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, on 25 March the people of New South Wales will work out whether they want high spending television ads telling us about beat police when they do not have any police at all in Bomaderry, where the rate of burglary is such that the local business people are up in arms. These are the sorts of things that the people of New South Wales will determine on 25 March. Unfortunately for Mr Fahey, he will come up short on schools, road funding and the numbers of police on the beat. We have seen the ads about beat police. If the government put the money it spent on these ads into the police, they would be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the final straw is hospitals. This man stood up and announced $600 million for new hospitals. Do you know what the reply of the people of New South Wales was?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GV5">Mr KNOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They did not believe him. It was not `Great!' The reply was: `If you are so concerned about hospitals and health, why the hell haven't you done something over the last seven years? Why have you closed more hospitals than any other Premier in New South Wales history? Why have you withdrawn more services out of health than any other Premier in New South Wales history?' I can assure you that that was the day that Premier Fahey lost the right to be Premier of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real thing about this road funding is the absolute hypocrisy of these people. They turn and scream about not having enough funds, even though they were given all these funds in untied grants which they spent elsewhere on other things. But they have tried to put the burden of local roads further onto local councils and shed the burden of funding further onto local councils. This has to be one of the most outrageous actions of any government. The government gets more funding, tries to bleed it and then pushes the burden onto other areas, spending money on phoney ads, and trying to make the people who have to deal with the problems pay more. That is absolutely atrocious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be good to see the RTA brought to account when Bob Carr gets into office, to be made a responsible organisation, looking after the safety and welfare of the people of New South Wales by providing them with an adequate road system which will not cause death, destruction and injury. I implore the people of New South Wales to take responsible action by voting out Mr Fahey and supporting their Labor candidates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the grievance debate this afternoon to highlight some of the inadequacies of the consultation process employed by the Queensland Labor government over the proposed electricity infrastructure to join Queensland with New South Wales through the national power grid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed infrastructure for Queensland has been termed Eastlink&mdash;a 330 kilovolt line, extending about 404 kilometres from Gatton, in the west of Brisbane, to Armidale. The proposed route of this preferred corridor was announced by the Queensland energy minister, Mr McGrady, a few weeks ago. While, as I have said, it is part of a plan to bring Queensland into a national power grid, in effect, it is not a national power grid. The grid will link Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia together, but it certainly does not link with Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Perhaps for very good practical reasons, they will not be part of it. So it is wrong to call it a national power grid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultation process, Queensland Labor government style, really has to be seen to be believed. Before the task force was appointed, before any consultation took place in reference to the Eastlink proposal, and before any of the general public was advised, the Queensland Labor government went ahead and acquired some land specifically for the purpose of the Eastlink proposal. Of course, we have become used to this sort of tactic with the Labor Party in Queensland. It is part of the old union style: `If you don't like me I'll still walk over the top of you.' Of course, the Queensland Labor government has been trying to portray itself as a caring government but I can assure this parliament that with this Eastlink proposal the people will not be walked over by the Queensland Goss government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister responsible, Mr McGrady, announced seven months ago that a consultation process in relation to Eastlink was to take place. What has happened since? He got the Queensland Electricity Commission to put up 25 public displays. This whole project is going to cost something like $400 million and will be 404 kilometres long. There have been 13 public meetings. That is the consultation process adopted by Minister McGrady in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After seven months, after 13 public meetings, after 25 public displays in towns along or near the route, the minister announced the preferred corridor. If the minister had been truly consulting with the people and was really concerned about the comments of many local members and the community in general&mdash;which is the most important thing&mdash;he would have been at the meeting I was at last week in Allora. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allora is a little town on the southern Darling Downs, a very pretty country town of about 1,000 inhabitants. Eight hundred people turned up at a public meeting there last Wednesday night. Allora is about one hour and 40 minutes drive from Brisbane, where the minister was. Surely, if he was concerned for the residents of Allora, and for the other people along the corridor just west of the Great Dividing Range, the minister would have attended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He could have driven the one hour and 40 minutes to Allora and attended the meeting. He would have had a driver to drive him there so it would not have required a great deal of effort. It would have been just a matter of taking a little bit of time out and talking to the people. But not this minister; he is committed to the line. He was committed even before the proposition was put to the people. That is evidenced by the fact that the Queensland government had already bought some land for this Eastlink proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister McGrady seems determined to go ahead with this proposal, despite what the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology said in its report of 1992. Chapter 9 of that report recommended that Queensland not be included in the initial assessment of possible grid extensions until the state demonstrated that its inclusion was economically achievable. It said that the Queensland state government, as at that time, had been unable to provide such economic information to either the Queensland public or the Queensland Electricity Commission. So much for the minister doing his job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Allora say that this is war. They are very concerned that only 12 months ago, and against their wishes, their local authority was amalgamated with the city of Warwick. That was the state government consulting with the people of Allora shire less than 12 months ago. In a local referendum, 900 people of the 1,000 residents of the town of Allora voted against an amalgamation of the two shires. In fact, the minister responsible, the minister for local government in Queensland, Mr Mackenroth, went further and put two extra shires into that amalgamation, notwithstanding overwhelming opposition from the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the people of Allora expressed a lot of concern about being unable to prevent the minister from going ahead with the Eastlink proposal. The only way that the people of Allora are going to be happy is if they see a change of government in Queensland before the end of this year. The Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Rob Borbidge, said at a meeting only two days prior to the Allora meeting that under a coalition government in Queensland there will be no Eastlink and that any land acquired by the state government would be given back to the people at no cost to those people. Because of the failure of the minister to consult with them and listen to their concerns, the only way the people of Allora can proceed now to stop the proposal&mdash;apart from sitting in front of the bulldozers&mdash;is to change the government in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the public record some of the concerns which were expressed at the meeting at Allora last Wednesday. People are concerned about the power line that will cut across the southern Darling Downs including towers 40 to 45 metres in height, with seven wires strung across the productive Darling Downs. They are concerned about the effect it will have on the $77 million rural tourism industry in that part of Queensland and the concern is growing daily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many farmers on the southern Darling Downs are now taking on farm hosting as part of their overall operation and part of a diversity to agricultural income on their farms. But the minister has not listened. The people are concerned about the effects on agricultural production on the Darling Downs. Let us look at where the Darling Downs is. It could well be the food bowl that services and provides food to the growing Asian market. It is less than seven hours flying time from Brisbane. It is an important agricultural area with some of the finest agricultural land in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Goss Labor government doing in Queensland? He is not listening to the people. He has never listened to the people. He was committed to the whole project before any announcement was made on the preferred corridor or even the fact that there would be a Queensland linking with the southern states. These people have other concerns, but time prevents me from going into those concerns in detail this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the Queensland government not upgraded the infrastructure needs for Queensland's sake? Queensland has some of the cheapest and the most efficient coal in Australia. It is environmentally friendlier than many other coal sources in Australia. Why has the Labor government not done as previous governments have done: upgraded the infrastructure, produced the power and created jobs for Queenslanders? They are the questions that the people of Allora and people along the southern Darling Downs want answered by the minister. But the minister, when he could have been at the meeting last week, was in Brisbane stuck up in his little burrow. He failed to come out to confront the 800 people who quite clearly have many grievances they want aired and answered. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We live in an era when significant progress has been made in Australia in assisting many groups of disadvantaged people within our community. The Federal Labor government can take a degree of pride in many achievements in those areas&mdash;for example, in assisting people with disabilities. There is one substantial group, however, which is going backwards fairly rapidly because of the actions of state governments: injured workers. I would like to talk today about workers compensation and the need for the federal government to become more directly and actively involved in ensuring that injured workers get proper compensation, proper rehabilitation and true justice which has been, and is increasingly being, denied to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look across the country, we see a varied picture. There are different problems in different states, but no state has a really good workers compensation system. In Victoria, unless you are extremely seriously injured, you are thrown off benefits after two years and onto social security thereby shifting the cost of the problem from employers and employer premiums to the Commonwealth. In Queensland, if you do not have access to common law and are unable to prove negligence, you are in a position where you have a maximum benefit of $72,000. If you suffer an injury at a relatively early age that makes you unable to work long term, the maximum compensation you can get is $72,000. It is roughly similar to the old Victorian system prior to Workcare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare, which is probably better than most systems&mdash;certainly with respect to benefits&mdash;has an appalling structure on procedures. It is a very common experience for people with Comcare to go through all sorts of hoops and dramas to get hold of somebody who can make a decision about their situation. Whichever part of the country we look at, workers have problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of uniformity in itself is a serious problem, something which many major employers agree with. There is a lowest common denominator effect already occurring across the states where different state governments, in order to attract industry to their particular state, decide that one of the ways they can do that is by reducing compensation premiums. How will that be done? By reducing benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of uniformity creates a serious problem for many major employers. In some circumstances, employers have to doubly insure the one worker, because that worker might perform work in two states&mdash;for example, interstate driving duties. On virtually every major indicator in workers compensation structures, whether it be definitions, benefits, journey accidents, the common law process or appeals, there is no uniformity across the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the state government has added insult to injury by spending $8 million on Workcover ads designed to show a totally unreal picture of the compensation reality. They show friendly, loving doctors who are all very keen to help the poor injured worker; employers with nice, friendly faces who are desperate to help them get well. There are cliches about the types of injury&mdash;the broken arm and stuff like that&mdash;totally ignoring the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year I wrote a column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> about these ads&mdash;the impact that they have on people and the injustices in the new system in Victoria. My office and I have been deluged with calls and letters from people who have had serious injuries. I have had people crying on the phone. People have spoken about the demoralising impact of these advertisements, how they have conveyed an image that is totally out of step with reality and have helped to compound all of the problems that people with workplace injuries suffer in the community, on top of the most obvious problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the general thrust of the recent Industry Commission report on workers compensation was good. It had some weaknesses, but the basic thrust, which is something that we do not expect from the Industry Commission, was very important and is something that members of the opposition should take note of: employers in this country do not bear enough of the costs of workplace injuries and, therefore, that imposes a competitive disadvantage on good employers. Bad employers with unsafe workplaces are getting away with less of a cost and on purely economic rationalist grounds they should be bearing the full cost of their poor practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Existing regulatory structures in health and safety are grossly inadequate. Companies that kill people get piddling fines. Even when they get a substantial fine, such as in the recent Nadenbousch case in Victoria where the fine of $120,000 for manslaughter was imposed, the same principals were back trading under a different name fairly shortly thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone in the community negligently drives a car and kills somebody, he or she is liable to end up in gaol. If an employer negligently runs his workplace and kills somebody, he is liable to end up with a $1,000 fine. The injustice of that is absolutely patent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974-75, the Whitlam government endeavoured to introduce a national compensation scheme which was designed, like the New Zealand scheme, not only to provide universal cover with various divisions but also to cover people for accidents and injuries both in the work force and outside and to be based on no fault. The issues are very much the same as now. We still have fragmented state schemes with many injustices, inadequate benefits, excessive administration costs and all of the problems that I have referred to before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I accept that the political reality is such that the Woodhouse model, as it has been termed, is unlikely to be introduced in Australia, at least in the foreseeable future&mdash;if for no other reason than some of the key players, including key unions, are not very keen on it&mdash;I would like to state here today that I am a supporter of that model and I will continue to work within the  processes  of the  parliament and my party to advance that concept. I believe ultimately that is the way we will have to go in order to get justice for injured workers and people injured in the broader community and to ensure that the administrative costs and inefficiencies are kept to a minimum in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we now face is that if we do not act the states are going to introduce uniformity, but uniformity based on the lowest common denominator&mdash;what they want to achieve in terms of lowest premiums and with minimal consideration for the interests of injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard many times in this debate about fraud and bludgers and all the myths, which are gross distortions of the reality of workers compensation and life for injured workers. The reality for injured workers is a loss of job, a loss of future employability&mdash;they are often rejected by an employer who has previously been very friendly towards them&mdash;pain, marriage break-ups, serious financial problems, psychological problems, a loss of confidence and a loss of self-esteem. We even have situations where workers incur injuries that people deny even exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who whinge about the cost that workers compensation imposes on the community should keep in mind the reality that the actual cost of workers compensation premiums across the states varies between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 per cent of total wage costs. If we put that in the context of things such as some of the grossly excessive pay hikes that senior executives have been taking in the past 10 years, we start to get a sense of the real injustice we are putting on injured workers. We are saying that it is fine for people to be paid $1 million or $2 million to run a company&mdash;far more than has been the case in the past&mdash;yet we are not going to allow somebody who has been seriously injured in the work force to live with dignity and some degree of financial security because his ability to earn a wage has been taken away from him through no fault of his own. </PARA>

I hope their constituents keep writing to them, otherwise they will not have anything to say. I think this letter illustrates very well the sorts of problems that genuine, very seriously injured workers face. This letter comes from a woman who has been a teacher for a long time and who has had a spinal fusion and a laminectomy&mdash;serious back operations; no bludging, no malingering. The letter says:</PARA>

I no longer wear high heels, go dancing, do the garden, or walk long distances with my grandchildren. My husband does the heavier household  chores and shopping. I cannot assist my aged parents with their household chores. I have not gone to the theatre since the fusion, for I cannot sit for any length of time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in this grievance debate, I grieve, once again, for the state of our nation. This is the 50th anniversary since the end of the Second World War. Australia has embarked on a program called Australia Remembers. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on the amount of work he has put into this program. It is correct that we should look back to those events of 1940 to 1945 and that we should commemorate and remember those who sacrificed so much for the freedom and prosperity that Australia has enjoyed in the ensuing years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help observing that Australia today is very different from the Australia of 50 years ago. Those who made those sacrifices 50 years ago must despair in many cases at what they see happening around them in Australia today. Indeed, many of the veterans in my electorate&mdash;and I have a large number of them who speak to me&mdash;do tell me just that. Some of them have put it very succinctly by saying that they wonder now whether it was worth what they did 50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the economic side, since 1983, under this Labor government, we have seen our national debt increase sevenfold. We have seen unemployment increase from 300,000 to 900,000. Regrettably, the rate of youth unemployment is about three times that of the rate of adult unemployment. We have seen our current account deficit continue to escalate. We have seen the extent of foreign ownership in this country&mdash;as this government rushes to sell off the family jewels, as it were&mdash;escalating and threatening to turn our children into peasants. We have the prospect of increased taxes once again and we see interest rates increasing. Now people are frightened of the prospect of yet another bust after the very short amount of relief we had after the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of greatest concern is the extent of welfare, which has become endemic in our society. It obviously has to be paid for and, as far as this government is concerned, it has to be paid for out of increased taxes. The government is already softening up the electorate for its budget. It keeps trotting out the old welfare line that we are, in fact, a low tax country. But in 1967, 12 per cent of household income went on taxes. In 1990 that figure had risen to 17.7 per cent. In 1967 the median taxpayer paying the median tax rate paid 24.6 per cent. In 1990 that figure had risen to 40.3 per cent. So much for the misconception that is often put before us&mdash;that Australia is a low tax nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we pay high taxes&mdash;some people pay disproportionately high taxes&mdash;because of the number of programs this government keeps coming up with to try to solve the problems it created in the first place. Hardly a day goes by that we do not hear a minister coming in here to announce a new program that is going to cost so many millions of dollars. We get tired of it, particularly as they are trying to solve problems that they created in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare creates dependency. Dependency undermines self-reliance and personal responsibility. Something is wrong when the system actually allows people to be better off from not working. That is the effect of many of these so-called programs that have been introduced by this government. Despite some of their efforts to redress that, they have not been at all successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the unemployed&mdash;the 800,000 or so, which is underestimated by an enormous amount&mdash;is not, by and large, an unwillingness to work. It is a lack of real jobs. Despite the assurances we received from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time today, which were met by derisive cries from this side of the House, the government's record on job creation is not all it is cracked up to be. Most of the jobs it tells us it has created are part-time jobs or short hour jobs and are not real, full-time, solid jobs that are going to last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest concern that is expressed to me by veterans in the community&mdash;those who served 50 years ago to make Australia what it ought to be today&mdash;is the social degradation which has occurred in our country. It was interesting to hear the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in the parliament today, in answer to a dorothy dix question, expressing concern about the increase we are seeing in the number of teenagers and young people taking up smoking. This is the same health minister who recently funded a so-called safe sex guide which was published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> magazine. This safe sex guide clearly, openly and graphically promotes sodomy. The sex guide does not warn young people about the health risks of sodomy. It does not tell them not to do it. It goes to great lengths to tell them how to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think you have to be a doctor&mdash;and I have certainly sought doctors' advice about this&mdash;to realise that sodomy has been largely responsible for the spread of AIDS. That is why it spread so rapidly amongst the homosexual community originally. That is why it is now being spread in the heterosexual community. The minister, I believe, needs to answer questions about the government's sponsorship of this particular safe sex guide. The publication which appeared in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> clearly has her endorsement. She says in the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an effort to further inform young women and men about STDs and HIV-AIDS, the federal government has collaborated with Cleo to produce this safe sex booklet. It deals with sexual health in a factual and non-judgemental way and is a resource that everyone should read.</PARA>
<PARA>I think most people in Australia would totally disagree that it is a resource that everyone should read. In fact, most decent Australians&mdash;I suggest the vast majority of Australians&mdash;would be very concerned if their teenage daughters were reading this magazine, particularly the government-sponsored insert. I have taken the step of placing on notice a number of questions about the sponsorship of this safe sex guide. I have asked the minister whether the government has sponsored this guide and, if so, `How is the government's sponsorship of this guide consistent with its HIV strategy? What sum did the government spend on the guide?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want confirmation, although it is fairly common knowledge, that it has cost the government&mdash;that is, taxpayers&mdash;$250,000 for this so-called safe sex guide. I have asked the minister whether she endorses the contents of the guide. I think that is a very important question. If she endorses the contents of the guide, as health minister she is surely culpable for endorsing not only anal sex but also a number of other practices that this so-called safe sex guide goes into great detail about, to teach young girls between 13 and 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that if she does not endorse the guide she has perpetrated a worse crime, a crime almost of Kellyesque proportions, by endorsing something she has not read. The question is whether $250,000 of taxpayers' money has been spent on something the contents of which the health minister is only vaguely aware of or did she read only the cover and not the contents? I happen to believe that these questions&mdash;and I am looking forward to receiving the answers&mdash;very much need to be asked. They are questions that are being asked by a lot of people who have become aware of this out there in Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute to a Queensland journalist by the name of Laurie Cavanagh. He has been raising this matter consistently. As far as I am aware he is the only columnist who has been asking questions about this matter and he has been doing so for a number of weeks. His latest two columns, those of last Saturday and the Saturday before, take it right to the health minister and ask her, as I am asking her, to explain why the government is spending taxpayers' money promoting sodomy. I hope we will get the answer to that question in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most decent people abhor this guide. Yet it is being imposed by this government upon our children. It is not very politically correct to speak in this place of values and morality. The gospel according to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> and Carmen may be politically correct, but it is a false gospel that is destroying our kids and our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to rise in the grievance debate today on a matter of concern not only to me but to my constituents. It is something they have had to put up with for a great deal of time. In recent months&mdash;and this is what brought it to my attention again&mdash;we have heard much said about airports and airport noises in Sydney. We have even seen protests. We have seen petitions and complaints from both sides of politics, and we have seen huge media coverage of the event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are residents within my electorate who for several years have been putting up with extreme levels of road noise. I am referring to my constituents who are residents along the Cumberland Highway and who have had many sleepless nights since that highway was completed through that section of my electorate in the early 1990s. By way of background for honourable members, the construction of the Cumberland Highway was a major improvement to infrastructure in south-western Sydney and turned roads in my electorate such as Warren Road, Betts Road, Jersey Road, Smithfield Road and Palmerston Road into major thoroughfares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section of the Cumberland Highway within my electorate has been identified as being exposed to relatively high levels of traffic noise. In fact, a very small primary school, St Gertrude's, which is located on the Cumberland Highway at Smithfield, recently decided that it needed to add new classrooms on its site. In order to have a development application approved by the Fairfield City Council, the school had to construct a noise abatement fence around that section of the new classrooms at a cost, I might add, of some $9,000. So a local school, providing a community service, had to spend $9,000 to protect just one small section of the school. The students who are not in that section of the school still have to cope with high levels of traffic noise. If an appropriate fence was constructed around their section, it would cost another $27,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose honourable members may ask why I am bringing up something like this and what relevance it has to the federal government. The fact is that the federal government supplies funding to the New South Wales government to alleviate traffic noise for residents. But the Fahey government in New South Wales has had its own agenda. It has formulated guidelines which ensure that roads in Liberal state electorates have a greater chance of receiving funding. The policy of the New South Wales state government requires noise attenuation for projects undertaken since 1988. When I first investigated this matter I thought that naturally I would be able to have restoration for properties within my electorate. But this law came into effect in 1988, the year the Greiner Liberal-National Party government came into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal government has now shamelessly favoured its own electorates in the building of roads since 1988. It is these roads which now receive noise attenuation. Thus, for example, properties along Pennant Hills Road, the region of Beecroft and Thompson's Corner, have received that noise attenuation treatment. Anyone can drive through that area and see what I am talking about. It is part of the Cumberland road system and traffic on that Pennant Hills Road section largely flows into my electorate and through my electorate along that Cumberland Highway. The residents of Beecroft&mdash;I do not begrudge it to them&mdash;have received, at no cost to them, well constructed 1.8 metre fences built in brick chosen by the residents and accompanied by beautiful polished wooden gates. The residents of my electorate have received nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never in my time in politics have I seen a more shameful diversion of Commonwealth funds for the political ends of a state government. Some $7.2 million has been spent of federal government funding on noise attenuation on the Pennant Hills Road section of the Cumberland Highway. Nothing has been spent on noise abatement on the same road that goes through Greystanes, Woodpark, Smithfield or Fairfield West. There is no state government policy dealing with noise alleviation on roads, the Cumberland Highway in particular, that have been constructed before 1988 and that have continued to be built after that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I understand, following the repeated representations that I have made, that the Sydney region of the Roads and Traffic Authority is currently undertaking an assessment of RTA roads in the metropolitan areas. It will be re-evaluating its policies in this regard after that assessment. It makes unquestionable good sense to have a policy dealing with traffic noise on roads that are now major highways. The only possible explanation for not having such a policy must be the political agenda of the present state Liberal coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken in this House before about the need for cooperation between state and federal governments. It is the concept which underpins the constitution. I have attacked the Fahey Liberal-National government for not cooperating with federal authorities on the issues of youth homelessness, supported accommodation assistance and the provision of child care. The Fahey government has established a reputation for unmitigated obstructionism in derailing federal government initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the federal member representing the residents of Prospect, I am furious that federal funds which are designed to be allocated to those in need of relief from traffic noise, regardless of the way in which they vote, have been diverted almost exclusively to residents in Liberal electorates. This has got to change. I believe that on 25 March the voters will no longer be fooled and will certainly be casting their votes to make sure that this, and other initiatives which I have raised in this House and that have been the fault of the Liberal-National Fahey government, will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this decision to future governments. When we talk about roads, noise alleviation and work that needs to be done we must make sure that for roads such as the Cumberland Highway that are given a directory of significance and a direction, going through a number of electorates, that what is applicable for one electorate in noise attenuation must be applicable in all electorates. That is why I grieve today on behalf of the constituents I represent within the Prospect electorate who have at no time been offered courtesy or even part of the $7.2 million that this federal Labor government has allocated to the state to make sure some work is done and some attention is paid to those areas of responsibility under the state Liberal government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not oppose in principle the notion of removing the ability for companies to pay direct outside the National Health Act. But we do not think it is fair that a large number of enterprise agreements should collapse because of this legislation.

But, as it stands and without those amendments, I want to make it quite clear that we will be opposing this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), has said, we have some grave concerns with the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994. They were outlined in my speech during the second reading debate when I moved a second reading amendment which clearly set out the matters of principle which are of concern to the opposition and, indeed, to many people abroad in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said, and have always said, that our concern is not to give power to the health funds and allow them to become rich and powerful&mdash;as the minister seems to want them to become&mdash;but to give fairness to the individuals who from time to time need health care in the hospital system. That has always been our overriding concern. The system is not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read all sorts of comments in the media that the minister is going to agree to the default payment system. There is an opportunity here and now for the minister to put it on the record. Are the press reports true? Does the minister intend to agree to a system of default payments which are meaningful so that private hospitals which are presently able to exist and carry out a service to the public can continue to do so? That is the question we want answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech in the second reading debate I said that without this legislation there is currently nothing to prevent health funds entering into negotiations with private hospitals and having a preferred provider agreement covering all out-of-pocket expenses. At the moment there is nothing to stop them doing that and, indeed, they could have been doing it for some considerable time. As I pointed out earlier in the debate, that is precisely what has happened in Victoria. In Victoria, the agreements were entered into, health insurance premiums went up and more people left private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question I put to the minister is one I foreshadowed earlier. In August 1994, the minister stated that these reforms would make the cost of health insurance premiums come down and, therefore, people would stop leaving health insurance funds. The minister set out this plan in August 1994 and private health insurance membership has continued to decline. It has gone down again, with membership now at 36.3 per cent. At the time I asked whether this reform would cause the minister to take out private health insurance&mdash;because she can afford it&mdash;or whether it would force out ordinary mums and dads, who will no longer be able to choose a doctor or hospital. That is the big question. Is the minister going to join up because these reforms are so great?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also drew attention to other issues. We said that, if the minister had agreed to the principles, we would have agreed to the second reading. The minister declined to do that and we voted against the bill. I told the minister in my speech in the second reading debate that we would support a committee hearing in the Senate. Not only has that been taken as being inevitable but also submissions are already being sought for a hearing of that committee before the legislation has even passed from the House into the Senate. That is not exactly a normal or proper agreement but one that acknowledges the reality that this inquiry is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two questions at this stage. Firstly, is the minister going to take out private health insurance so that next time she needs to slip between the sheets in a private hospital she will be able to do so, knowing that she is not sponging off the mums and dads who keep those beds open? Secondly, is the minister going to agree to the default payment in respect of hospitals which are left out of preferred provider agreements&mdash;as is the situation now and as would be provided for in our foreshadowed amendments&mdash;or not? Are the press reports correct or are they misleading? What was the source of those reports?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of points need to be made. We have been quite comfortable with the idea of this matter being discussed at greater length in the Senate committee that will be established at an appropriate time to examine these questions. It is quite clear that a number of interest groups have a very considerable stake in the outcome, not only of this legislation but of those discussions. I think it is very interesting that, at the same time as opposition members tell us this legislation will not work, they are nonetheless representing the interests of a number of players in this game who believe that it will work, and that is why they are complaining so loudly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the health insurance funds, on behalf of consumers, have been price takers. They have had little opportunity to seriously negotiate better prices and products with the hospitals and doctors. This will give them power for the first time not to be price setters but negotiators. That is why I have brought this bill&mdash;the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994&mdash;into the House. It will give health funds a much stronger voice than they have had in the past. I do not apologise for that. In Australia we have seen a steady decline in the number of people taking out private health insurance because people rightly judge it not to be in their interests to do so. As long as the health insurance funds are not able to provide an adequately priced product and to guarantee against out-of-pocket costs, surprise, surprise, people will continue dropping out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt opposition members will want to continue to hold before the public of Australia the prospect of tax rebates, but I think that people are starting to disbelieve them. The shadow minister&mdash;as opposed to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who is taking this bill through&mdash;has made it clear through various media outlets around the country that he for one is not confident there will be tax rebates or any tax breaks for people who take out private health insurance. When the shadow minister talks about it, he uses words like `maybe', `possible' and `staggered introduction'. He knows, as I do, that taking $3 billion from the health system generally and putting it into private health funds is not necessarily going to reverse the problem of declining private health insurance, which is what we confront here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is unashamedly designed to help consumers&mdash;not private hospitals, doctors or private health insurance funds, but consumers. The task now for private health insurance funds is to make sure that anyone who can afford private health insurance will decide that they are better off buying that product than either going to Medicare if they are on a low income&mdash;or, for that matter, a high income&mdash;or self insuring, as some do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the member may wish to denigrate other members on the basis of the choices they make about private health, private education or anything else in our community, through this legislation I intend to make sure that private health insurance funds are advocates for consumers and that they act in the interests of people seeking to privately insure. The funds should act not in the interests of doctors or hospitals but in the interests of patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated&mdash;it was not in a report; my dulcet tones came across the airwaves&mdash;that I was prepared, given the apparent flexibility of the new shadow minister for health, to examine issues such as default payments as long as they were properly discussed and assessed in the Senate committee. But, if we get some proposal that seriously undermines the legislation&mdash;which would set those limits far too high and make the negotiations between the private health funds and the hospitals Clayton's negotiations&mdash;I will not support it. So it very much depends on the nature of propositions that come to us from the Senate committee, the opposition or anyone else. As the responsible minister, I want to make it very clear that I am delighted with the opposition we are getting from the private hospitals and the doctors. That signals to me that we have the recipe pretty well right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) declined to answer whether she was going to take out private health insurance. I think it is important for us to look at the facts so we see the relevance of my question to her. Eighty per cent of all revenue to the private hospital sector comes from private health funds. I hold no brief for the funds; it is the minister who is giving them unprecedented power. It is the minister who will make them rich and who will take freedom of choice away from the ordinary mums and dads who value it. The minister seems to be forgetful. Evidence of her forgetfulness is that she left $5,000 in her bank account and remembered to pay it back only when the police reminded her. That money came from the same source as Brian Burke's funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously put this case before the minister. Suppose I am a patient&mdash;an ordinary individual&mdash;and I want to have my appendix out. I say, `I want to have Dr Bloggs operate on me,' but Dr Bloggs operates only in Dr Lawrence's hospital and Dr Lawrence's hospital does not have a preferred provider agreement with my health fund. If I go to Dr Lawrence's hospital and have Dr Bloggs operate on me, I pay the entire health bill. Under the minister's scheme I do not get any payment, despite the fact that I am paying over $1,000 a year for my health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I personally carry health insurance because I believe I should take responsibility for my health. I believe that, if people can afford to do so, they should do so. I wish to put on the record a quote from the chief executive of the Berwick hospital, which is in Victoria. I remind the minister that this hospital has a preferred provider agreement right now. In a letter, the chief executive of the Berwick hospital said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hospital presently has provider agreements with most health funds. However there is no guarantee that these arrangements will continue at the same level when the reforms are implemented by legislation. It is of concern that it would be of financial benefit to both our competitors if the agreements were not renewed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The reason it is of benefit to the competitors is that the competitors' hospitals are owned by health funds. In other words, the big difference in this legislation is that power&mdash;unprecedented&mdash;is given to the health funds so they can choose which hospitals their members can go to and which hospitals they cannot. Because 80 per cent of all revenue comes from those funds, they will simply force people out of business. The letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would be of financial benefit to both our competitors if the agreements were not renewed as it would give the opportunity for one of the larger groups to take over the hospital or for the hospital to close due to reduced financial returns.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reality. People in regional Australia are the ones who are going to suffer the most, and nothing in this legislation is going to assist the decline. I refer now to the minister's speech when she summed up at the end of the second reading debate. She actually indicated that she did not think it would be a bad thing if the whole private health insurance system collapsed. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central tenet of this government's health policy has always been, now over a 30-year period, universal access to high quality public health for all Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is our commitment, but with freedom&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">insured out of the taxation system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, out of the pockets of the mums and dads&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and with the addition of a Medicare levy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>providing for less than 10 per cent of the total cost. The minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that context we obviously also value&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>value, mind you!&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the role of the private health sector and the private health insurance market. But, as I have indicated, the private health sector has essentially an additional supplementary role.</PARA>
<PARA>She said `additional supplementary role'; not essential, as Senator Richardson, as he then was, said when he said that 40 per cent of the people needed to be insured privately for Medicare to work; not even the 20 per cent that the ACT-caucus working party said could be a worst case scenario. She said that it could be replaced altogether. Minister, if we go to 20 per cent you will have to find $1.6 billion extra of taxpayers' money. If we go below that it will be $3 billion, won't it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promises and undertakings made by the opposition are not the ones that were made in Fightback, not the ones that were talked about by Dr Hewson today, but very simply are undertakings that mums and dads&mdash;ordinary punters in the street&mdash;think are fair.

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 contains amendments announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the 1994-95 federal budget and have operated since 11 May 1994. The amendments give effect to the government's decision to decrease the customs duty on topped crude oil by 2.977c per litre and on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre. These changes will lower input costs for industry and will specifically benefit coastal shipping, export oriented mineral projects and certain manufacturing operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 will operate from 1 July 1994. In May 1993, this government decided to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences from 1 July 1993 by phasing out the most developed countries from access to the developing country margin of preference for certain imported commodities. On 4 May this year my colleague Senator Cook announced in the Working Nation white paper that a similar phase-out would be extended to the remainder of commodities in the customs tariff with the exception of cheese, sugar, unmanufactured tobacco and certain replacement components for passenger motor vehicles. The phase-out of the margin of preference will be achieved by freezing the developing country rate for the subject commodities at the pre-1 July 1994 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also announced on budget night an increase of 1.194c per litre in customs duties on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene for use in aircraft. This increase is a further part of the process announced by the government in the 1992-93 federal budget of a phased introduction of full recovery of the costs incurred by the Civil Aviation Authority in implementing aviation safety standards and 50 per cent of the costs of safety standards setting and compliance by the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of duty on aviation gasoline is subject to further variation in respect of the duty collected and paid to the CAA to recover airways costs attributable to aviation gasoline powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction of 7.521c per litre follows the adoption by the CAA of a marginal cost basis for the pricing of services provided to operators of gasoline powered aircraft. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the fact that a large proportion of CAA facilities are put in place because they are required for regular public transport operations mostly undertaken by aviation kerosene powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the government's policy pertaining to the automotive industry until the year 2000, tariffs on passenger motor vehicle&mdash;PMV&mdash;replacement components were to be maintained at 15 per cent from 1 July 1992. Amendments contained in this schedule redress certain anomalies which arose in the implementation of the government's policy. Specifically, a number of tariff classifications were omitted from the original PMV schedule of replacement components. There was also a small number of other classifications for which rates of duty had already fallen below the 15 per cent threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments introduce a consistent application of government assistance for imported replacement components for the Australian automotive sector. The Malaysia-Australia trade agreement provides bilateral trade concessions for signatory countries. The amendments contained in this schedule provide a free rate of duty for unvulcanised compounded rubber from Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 will operate from 23 September 1994. Following a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 19 January 1994, the government's intended assistance rate of 12 per cent&mdash;now 10 per cent&mdash;for semi-finished lens blanks for spectacles was reduced to free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has put in place a regimented decrease in tariff protection since July 1988. The purpose of this amendment is to restore the previous level of assistance for semi-finished lens blanks and a structured phase-down for the subject goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also contains a number of other minor technical or administrative amendments. Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is a relatively uncontroversial bill that would enact a series of minor modifications to the Customs Tariff Act. The sections of the bill relating to petroleum duty, aviation gasoline and kerosene are identical to the comparable sections of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tariff modifications in excise bills apply only to domestically produced goods&mdash;in this case certain petroleum products. The customs amendments in this bill are needed to cover the importation of those products. Most of the amendments in the bill were originally introduced as customs tariff proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to petroleum duty, the bill proposes to reduce the customs duty on topped crude oil by 2.977c per litre and the duty on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre. The reductions were announced in the 1994-95 budget and took effect on 11 May 1994. The reductions partially offset the 3c per litre petroleum duty increase that was announced in the 1993-94 budget. The government wanted to increase the duty by another 2c per litre, but it abandoned that plan in October 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now conceded that even the 3c per litre increase had a significantly adverse effect on import costs in the mining and shipping industries. It is typical of this arrogant and out of touch government that it took it a year to understand these effects of the duty increase. The consequences were apparent to everybody else throughout Australia on budget day 1993. As we have informed the House previously, the cost increases to coastal shipping were such that they defeated all of the gains that had been achieved through the rationalisation of crewing and all those other benefits. They were wiped out in one fell swoop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The production costs also of a major user of fuel oil in the mining industry, Nabalco, increased by $9 per tonne by this measure. The increase effectively imposed a 13 per cent levy on its alumina exports. The duty increase wiped out the benefits of the final stage of the shipping industry reform program, which I have mentioned already. The following day the Treasurer announced a 5c per litre increase in duty, having just signed the previous agreement. We tried to explain to the government the effects of the duty increase. The government's response at that time, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, may remember, was to guillotine the debate on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we welcome the government's decision to reduce the duty on these petroleum products. It is disappointing that it has not reviewed the duty increase applying to the road transport and rail industries as well. I am just wondering when the government, having so narrowed its tax options after the last election, is ever going to wake up to the debilitating effects on our transport sector of taxing fuel at ever increasing rates. Australia is not a tiny place. Its major resources are diversified throughout the country and can be found thousands of miles from the sea. Yet we continue to put massive taxes on transport in the form of fuel levies, sales taxes and other duties on road equipment and rail equipment. It is just so silly that the Brazilians can put orange juice into this country without practically any tax, including a tariff, yet our Australian producers are paying $1000 or $2000 a week in tax on every semitrailer carting their product to the equivalent markets. It is an unbelievable situation that has been allowed to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parts of this bill also deal with developing country preferences. On 20 February 1993 the Prime Minister announced that the government planned to modify the tariff preference arrangements applying to the more advanced developing countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. The government accordingly phased out the preferential tariffs applying to imports of chemicals, textiles, clothing and footwear, rubber and leather goods, dried fruit, and fruit juice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Working Nation the government announced that it intended to extend the phase out even further. Accordingly, the bill proposes to extend it to cover all those countries' exports to Australia except cheese, unmanufactured tobacco, sugar, and replacement components for passenger motor vehicles. The list of states that will still be entitled to receive tariff concessions is short and includes the most poverty stricken countries on earth, such as Bhutan, Haiti and Somalia. The bill also extends the Malaysia-Australia trade agreement to cover unvulcanised compounded rubber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regards to aviation gasoline and kerosene, the bill proposes to increase the air safety regulation duty on avgas and avtur by 1.194c per litre. It also seeks to enact a 7.521c per litre decrease in the component of avgas excise associated with the CAA's airways services. The net change in duty on avgas is therefore a decrease of 6.327c per litre. Avgas is the fuel used in piston driven propeller aircraft. Avtur is used in jet aircraft and turbine powered propeller aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tariff variations in the bill took effect from 1 July 1994 and were first announced in the 1994-95 budget. The air safety regulation duty has its origins in the government's aviation safety cost recovery program, which progressed fitfully through the 1980s. After several false starts, and after incurring the intense distrust of most of the industry, the government announced in the 1992-93 budget that the cost of setting and enforcing safety standards would be shared between the industry and the government, with the government meeting 50 per cent of the cost up to a limit of $22.8 million, indexed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the government increased the duty on avgas by 0.264c per litre and introduced an 0.264c per litre excise on avtur as an interim cost recovery measure. The increases took effect on 1 September 1993. The increase in the avgas duty was more than offset by a 3.013c per litre decrease in the duty that took effect from 1 July 1993. The 1.194c per litre increase in the duty on avgas and avtur is a further step in that cost recovery program. The 7.521c per litre decrease in the avgas duty is attributable to a reduction in the cost of providing airways services such as air traffic control and flight information. Airways services are funded by charges on avtur aircraft and by a portion of the avgas excise. Over the last few years the CAA has substantially reduced its expenditure on delivery of those services by consolidating its operations. The reduction in the duty on avgas passes some of those savings onto the general aviation sector, which largely uses avgas powered aircraft. Avtur operators have already received significant benefits from the authority's cost reduction program; the CAA reduced its airways charges by $90 million in 1992-93 and by $109 million in 1993-94. This is a positive move and one the opposition supports simply because, as we have said so many times and as I have just said, all the transport costs on road and rail flow through to the eventual and final providers, be they tourist operators or whatever. Such reductions will make Australia a more competitive international destination, which it has failed to be on its domestic routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Building a Competitive Australia it was announced that the tariffs on replacement passenger motor vehicle components would be frozen at 15 per cent once they had reached that level on 1 July 1992. It is an interesting thing to be reminded in the context of some of today's efforts that this government actually brought down a program called Building a Competitive Australia. Of course, this government's view of expenditure cutting is that the state governments should cut expenditure and the Commonwealth should spend more on its own purpose outlays. The Prime Minister stands up here, sticks his chest out and says, `I have reduced expenditures as a percentage of GDP.' He does not go back to find out by how much the states have had to increase their taxes, particularly through levies on services such as electricity supply, et cetera, to make up the difference. Of course, the whole public sector revenue requirement is consequently going through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have read the reference to Building a Competitive Australia. But, while all that has been happening, the government has three authorities that should be to the forefront in this competition policy. The government is trying to sell Qantas. To maximise the sale return, it drove a competitor out of the country. It had told Air New Zealand that it could come along. But, all of a sudden, when it looked as though it might affect the price of Qantas, the government said, `We don't want competition with Qantas. We want competition with the electricity authorities of the states.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go a step further and read in today's papers that the government is now almost committed to bulking up its international airports state by state and selling them to one buyer. In other words, Kingsford-Smith and Badgerys Creek go to the same developer. I can tell you that Badgerys Creek will not go ahead too quickly. Quite clearly, if you have no competition, Badgerys Creek will be travelling very slowly because no commercial operator is going to spend money in competition with his own investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes an absolute and unmitigated mockery of a competition policy if you are going to have two major international airports and let one bloke run both of them when one has not been built yet. It would be different if they were both operating and the operator said, `Okay.' But, when one is not built yet, what incentive exists to get it up and running at great cost when you have got the other one anyway? Of course it will not happen, of course it is wrong, and of course it makes a joke of a competition policy. The first stage of any competition policy is competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the same deal with ANL. ANL cannot be competed with, but everything else can. It is the most stupid arrangement I have ever seen that the government is chest beating on building a competitive Australia when the three very major issues within its own absolute responsibility are sidelined and competition is openly rejected on all three. One might wonder how the next speaker will talk his way out of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Industry, Science and Technology recently conducted a review of the tariff classifications applying to the passenger motor vehicle sector. The review identified a number of goods that had been omitted from the schedule of replacement components. The review also identified a number of classifications for which the associated tariff rates have already fallen below 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff proposal No. 4, which is enacted in this bill, freezes the rates applying to those products at 15 per cent. The goods that would be affected include gaskets, car alarms and car seats. There are some other amendments, including a number of minor changes to bring the customs tariff into line with the harmonised commodity description and coding system; the restoration of the correct tariff level for semi-finished lens blanks for spectacles following an Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision in January last year; and the correction of the responsible minister's title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am wondering&mdash;and I have not read that little bit of the speech&mdash;whether that means the occasional ministers are now built into the legislation, meaning they do not come here very often. I am not sure exactly how that is, but I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is some correction. I hope it better describes ministers in this parliament today as people we see from time to time. Overall&mdash;as I have indicated throughout my speech&mdash;the opposition does not oppose this bill and wishes it good speed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 before the House reduces the customs duty payable on top crude oil by 31 per cent and on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 23 per cent. It also reduces the customs duty payable on aviation gasoline while increasing the duty on aviation kerosene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation represents the government's response to representations from industry over the significant impact of crude oil tariffs on the input costs of export based mining and mineral processing operations, the coastal shipping industry and certain manufacturing operations. Accordingly, the bill raises several important issues concerning tariff protection policies, the internationalisation of the Australian economy and trends in Australia's international trading performance. I wish to address these issues in the context of this significant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government over the last 10 years has implemented a phased reduction in tariff walls in Australia&mdash;not the sort of cut and burn policy that the opposition took to the last federal election. Worldwide trends point towards a movement for free trade. Even when in 1996 Australia reaches an average protection level of five per cent, we will still have protection running above the OECD average. Free trade is a worldwide trend. It is reflected in the latest round of GATT. It is reflected in the arrangements now in place in the European community. It is reflected in the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the movement towards free trade on the American continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our own region of the Asia Pacific this government has led and joined with its trading partners through APEC in moving towards freer trade&mdash;that is, to have in place by the year 2010 free trade arrangements for developed nations in the Asia Pacific and by the year 2020 for non-developed nations. It is foolish to believe that a nation in isolation can defy these trends. The mobility and spread of international capital means that old protectionist and regulation based national economic strategies no longer work. This is particularly the case for a country such as Australia where improved transport and communications have effectively ended the tyranny of economic distance and given Australia a unique opportunity in our history&mdash;that is, to use our proximity to the Asia Pacific growth region to trade our way to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Location is now working in Australia's favour. For the first time in 200 years we now see location as an advantage, not a disadvantage, and no longer a source of fear and inward looking isolationist policies. Few nations have undergone such a rapid transformation of their trade position and their opportunities for economic growth. The key for Australia is to manage our internationalisation of the economy while preserving and enhancing the integrity of core Australian values&mdash;that is, our commitment to an independent Australian identity and social egalitarianism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, over the last 20, 30, even 40 years in Australia protection has emerged as a mug's game for a small country such as ours. By doling out tariffs through the postwar period, the companies took the profits and the protection without any incentive to innovate and improve, and without any incentive to grow and employ more people. It really was a mug's game to be doling out tariffs under the regime of the federal government in the 1950s and 1960s and not offer industry any reason whatsoever to update its technology, to update its management and labour relations practices, to move into world markets and compete effectively. This left Australia by the early 1980s with an exceptionally narrow and uncompetitive industrial base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the steel industry with our resource endowments should have been one of the nation's strongest industries. Instead, it was going out the door backwards. Australian made cars were becoming less and less competitive both in price and quality. The response of the outgoing government in the early 1980s was to propose yet more protection with tariffs of up to 125 per cent. Through the 1970s and 1980s the industries which lost most jobs and discarded most workers in Australia were those that were protected most by tariffs and quotas. Profits in the same industries were well above average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I oppose and contradict totally the notion that protection has anything to do with the protection of jobs. It protects profits, not employment. It also represents a huge regressive tax on working families, draining consumption, draining aggregate demand and driving down economic growth. Protectionist policies also add to the cost of inputs for export based industries, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors in Australia. It is very important, having discarded the failed policies of protectionism in Australia, to build an ethos of domestic and international competition. Tariffs, of course, are the most anticompetitive practice in which any government can engage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic competition directly determines the effectiveness of organisational methods and management of firms in a particular industry. A competitive environment is also likely to promote a range of resourceful and responsive supporting industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two basic ways for a small nation like Australia to maintain domestic rivalry without breaking down the size of its firms so that they are unable to compete. The first method is to keep Australia's markets open to international competition, and that is what this government is doing through its phased tariff reduction program and legislation such as this. The second measure is to follow the success of small export based nations such as Sweden and Switzerland; that is, to find a scale not available on domestic markets by taking advantage of worldwide markets and international trading opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that a small nation like ours will not form a home base for global scale industries like car and aircraft manufacturing. Our targets must be threefold. The first is to secure Australia's future as a regional base in the Asia-Pacific region for global scale industries. I am glad to see that this is the direction we are taking. It accounts for much of the success that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) has had in recent years. Our second target must be export based growth and import substitution in industries where Australia can develop or already has competitive advantages. Our third goal is to improve the general efficiency of the non-traded sector, recognising the great importance the efficiency of this sector holds for the cost of exports in the traded sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key is competitiveness; to understand that Australia is competing not by domestic standards but by international standards, where competition is never static. It is always relative and always dynamic. It is very important to get a feel for the best means by which the parliament, the government and the Australian people can measure Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally economics, as a discipline, has focused on domestic indicators: GDP, unemployment, inflation and interest rates. That is still very much the focus of this parliament, the media and national debate. But domestic indicators such as those never provide the sort of relativity, the sort of comparison that is needed to accurately measure Australia's international trading competitiveness. We must shift our focus from domestic indicators to those of an international and comparative nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three methods by which a government and nation can measure its international competitiveness. The first is in the short term: to examine changes in its exchange rate and unit labour costs. These, unfortunately, do not reflect on longer-term issues such as productivity and flexibility. They may in fact reflect a depreciation, because of lower commodity prices in certain parts of the traded sector, that can make manufacturing and service exports look more competitive than they actually are once the fundamentals and the underlying efficiency of those sectors are assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second means by which a government can measure international competitiveness is through an analytical framework: that is, to provide a subjective assessment of performance. I will provide the House with two examples. Last year I received a briefing from Austrade about its analytical work on Australia's international competing and trading strengths and weaknesses. Austrade dispelled the myths about our industrial relations system and the work ethic in Australia. Austrade said that this was really not, in its experience, a barrier to our trading success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the December 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asian Business Review</EMPHASIS> a list of public holidays available in the Asia-Pacific region. This will be interesting to members opposite; those who say that in Australia the work ethic is not strong enough because we have too many public holidays. This was the list of public holidays in a 12-month period in each of the nations: Hong Kong 18, South Korea 17, Taiwan 17, Japan 15, Thailand 15, Indonesia 13, New Zealand 13, Singapore 11, Vietnam 10, and then we come down to Australia with nine. Australia is well below the standard and level of public holiday availability among Asian trading nations. We were only undercut on this score by China with eight and India with seven public holidays per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) indicating that Australia does not have a strong work ethic. On the key measure of public holidays we are doing well and that dispels the myth of a poor work ethic in Australia. That is something that the Austrade officials relayed to me in their briefing in Parramatta last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also told how shipping and transport costs are critical in Australia, as is the image of our financial system. The great strength that Australia has in terms of our international competitiveness is the security and stability of our social and political systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the World Economic Forum's 1994 competitiveness report. It ranks countries in 380 performance areas using official statistics and a questionnaire survey of more than 16,000 business executives worldwide. These rankings are then combined to obtain country ranks in eight principal factors. Australia's overall ranking among 41 nations improved from 16 in 1992 to 15 in 1994. The top five were the United States of America, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Germany. Australia ranked well in  resource  endowment and socio-political stability. However, we ranked relatively poorly in domestic capital formation, industrial production, protection levels, management performance and business transaction costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third method by which a nation can measure its international competitiveness is to examine long-term trends in productivity and trade. In an internationally exposed economy, progress ultimately relies on strong productivity growth and trade performance. I refer the House to the findings of the 1991 study by Access Economics, well known to the opposition, and the Allen Consulting Group, well known to the government from the recent FitzGerald report on national savings. The report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Developing Australia's national competitiveness</EMPHASIS>. The report found that productivity levels in Australian agricultural and mining are high by world standards. Average manufacturing productivity was, however, 20 to 25 per cent below international best practice. The private sector labour productivity `appears to be often 10 per cent below the average international levels'. Productivity in many of our utilities is half to three-quarters of overseas levels. That is something the government will be addressing through the Hilmer reforms and package of national competition policy reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to refer the House to the international performance indicators project of the Bureau of Industry Economics, which assesses the performance of Australia's infrastructure providers. The competitiveness of Australian enterprises in international markets is determined in part by the costs of inputs and services of Australian infrastructure, mainly provided by government business enterprises. These make up between 10 and 25 per cent of total costs for most industries. The report found that in each of six sectors Australia's performance was below international best practice. It provided a ratio of best Australian productivity to international best practice. For labour factors in electricity the figure was 0.3, telecommunications 0.52, rail freight 0.16, on the waterfront for coal 0.92 and on the waterfront for containers 0.84. The relative productivity on the capital factor for electricity was 0.84, telecommunications 0.78, rail freight 0.32, road freight 0.79, on the waterfront for coal it was 1.00 and on the waterfront for containers it was 0.40. The 1994 report concluded by saying that the results:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">suggest that the degree of competition within an infrastructure industry and the rate of change of demand and technology are key determinants of infrastructure performance. The industry where Australia's performance is closest to IBP&mdash;road freight&mdash;enjoys by far the greatest degree of competition while the industry where the performance gap is largest&mdash;rail transport&mdash;suffers from the least degree of competition and the highest degree of government involvement and subsidisation.</PARA>
<PARA>This indicates the strategic importance of the national competition policy reforms. That is the reason why Australia, through those initiatives, can gain a five per cent increase in GDP, and why we can lower the current account deficit by almost two per cent as a proportion of national output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways Australia is at a turning point in the internationalisation and trading hopes for our economy. We spent the last 10 years opening up the economy to international trade. We must spend the next 10 years struggling, very determined, outward-looking and focused in our efforts to ensure that the economy is internationally competitive. This reflects on the suggestion of reform fatigue. Recently, in a round of interviews the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said that Australians were suffering reform fatigue. He is going to be campaigning on strong values but inoffensive policies for the next election. Nothing could be more contrary to Australia's best economic interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need the sorts of reforms achieved by this government through APEC&mdash;free trade in the Asia-Pacific next century&mdash;the Hilmer initiatives and the working nation program to make the labour market more efficient. Collectively, APEC-Hilmer-Working Nation represents the biggest slab of micro reform in our history, all produced over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent reports have highlighted the economic gains to Australia of a continuous program of micro-economic reform. In May 1994 EPAC reported on the economic effects</PARA>
<PARA>of micro-economic reform based on the full implementation of an aggressive and ambitious reform scenario. The reform program, and the attainment of international best practice in all sectors, was grouped into four categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is reform in the private sector, including labour market reform, workers compensation and improved management practices. The second is phasing down tariffs&mdash;such as in this legislation&mdash;and subsidies for the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The third is improving Australia's federal relations in the delivery of social sector services. Fourth is full competition and international efficiency in transport and communications GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EPAC estimated that while existing micro policy settings are likely to yield a long-run GDP gain of 8.2 to 8.4 per cent, a more comprehensive reform agenda could yield 13 to 15.7 per cent. These findings are confirmed by the recent work of the Industry Commission, which found that the implementation of the Hilmer agenda for national competition policies is likely to add five per cent to GDP and reduce our current account deficit by 1.9 per cent of national output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of these huge gains are maximised by a complementary reform package. For example, competition policy provides an incentive for firms to improve efficiency, while workplace bargaining provides the organisational flexibility required to implement workplace gains. These reforms are essential if we are to achieve more sustainable rates of economic growth and overcome external constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the figures&mdash;the tables, graphs and charts&mdash;for the current account deficit against the rate of unemployment since the 1970s, a clear external constraint on the economy emerges. That is, when the current account deficit approaches six per cent of GDP. In 1982, 1986 and 1990, the unemployment rate was of the order of six to eight per cent, as it is now in 1995. An externally constrained unemployment rate of that order has emerged in Australia. The major focus of micro and economic policy must be to bring down that constraint so that more sustainable rates of economic growth can be achieved and unemployment rates can be greatly lowered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is one more bill in a very long line of legislation dealing with the issue of tariffs. When I first came to Australia&mdash;over 26 years ago now&mdash;I did not know what tariffs were. I very quickly found out that Australia, an island continent down in the South Pacific, was surrounded by this huge wall called tariffs. But what are tariffs? Essentially, they are a tax&mdash;a tax on imported goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theory behind tariffs is simply that if we tax imported goods we encourage local manufacture of local goods and products to meet the needs of the local marketplace. For a long time those policy settings and those parameters were effective. However, eventually tariffs became a huge cost to the community because behind the tariff wall there built up a huge set of values and understandings&mdash;or misunderstandings&mdash;in the Australian context. That included a manufacturing industry which became relatively lazy and inward looking, without particularly high quality standards or excellent service standards, and learning very little about international marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, through the high tariff period, Australia was a price taker. Because we sell commodities to the rest of the world, whether off the farm or out of the ground, we became a very wealthy nation through commodities but we tried to build a manufacturing sector for high value added goods behind a wall of protection, a wall of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some sense, such a policy was self-defeating. I cite the motor vehicle industry as a good example. If the Holden motor company found that its prices had gone up a bit, it would go to the tariff board and say, `We must have an increase in tariffs. We want you to increase the taxes on imported motor vehicles so that we can raise the price of a Holden.' The tariff board would say `You are right. All the numbers say you are right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the union would go along to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and say, `We have a problem here. The cost of motor cars has just gone up because tariffs have gone up. Obviously, we must have an increase in our wages.' The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would say, `You are right.' Then the company would go back to the tariff board and say, `The commission just gave our whole work force a wage increase. Our costs have gone up. We will have to have another increase in tariffs.' So the spiral would go on and on. We increased tariffs but we did nothing about improving productivity and quality or about learning about international marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gough Whitlam, an ex-Prime Minister of Australia, took a 25 per cent whack out of tariffs in the early 1970s. That sent a huge shock through Australian industry. I might also say that it wiped out one huge slab of Australian manufacturers. We used to be a proud manufacturing nation. We had a great manufacturing industry. </PARA>

In 1992-93, and still in 1995, with 1.1 million Australians employed in manufacturing&mdash;about the same number that were employed 30 years ago&mdash;instead of that representing 31 per cent of the work force, it represents only about 16 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA>What an indictment. I want to raise an issue of a young man called Scott. He is 19 years of age.

He really is in a catch-22 situation.

Here is a young man, 19 years of age, wanting to work, actively involved in a LEAP project. But if a prospective employer wanted to hold the job open for Scott until he completed the LEAP project, the employer would not be able to obtain the job subsidy because Scott is no longer long-term unemployed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been brought to my attention that plans are afoot to affiliate the University of Queensland Union with the National Union of Students. As I understand it, the issue was discussed at a secretive meeting of the University of Queensland Union executive held at 5.00 p.m. on Friday, 17 February, a meeting which was also attended by NUS president, John Graham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out to honourable members that the University of Queensland is one of only a handful of campuses not affiliated with NUS, and has long been sought after because of its comparatively large enrolment.

Under the guise of representing students' rights, NUS effectively operates a shopfront for the ALP on every member campus.

On top of the $100,000, around 14 fully funded trips, accommodation included, would need to be provided for UQ students to attend the national AUS conference each year in Melbourne. Add on other so-called indirect expenses, with a multitude of other junkets organised in the guise of defending students' rights, and we have a very expensive confidence trick being perpetrated at the expense of UQ students who just want to get on with their degrees and have no ambition to become professional students or party militants.</PARA></TALK.START>

Effectively, UQ students will be forced to make a $100,000 plus donation to the ALP each year. Despite this, NUS has the unmitigated gall to claim in its propaganda that it stopped Labor's unconscionable changes to HECS and Austudy which were defeated in the Senate last year by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rubbish. Mel Wheeler, the national education officer, claimed credit for defeating double HECS for second degrees and for ensuring that the proposal which saw students penalised for taking extra time to complete their degrees was blocked in the Senate. If the students affected should thank anyone, it should be the coalition, not the NUS, for defending their position in the Senate. It should be remembered that it did not take $100,000 from each campus or the flying of hordes of student activists around the country on junkets to achieve this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that despite the sanctimonious lip-service to students' rights and going through the motions of opposing the government of the day, the NUS remains a pro-ALP organisation, and an unrepresentative one at that. At UQ, for example, the fact that the union and student representatives are elected does not support the argument that the UQ union is a representative body. Only 3,000 to 4,000 students vote in these elections out of a total population of about 23,000. A group that needs only 1,500 to 2,000 votes out of a student body of 23,000 to control the union cannot be regarded as representative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that if UQ joins NUS all the students will be forced to featherbed student hacks based in Melbourne. Students are forced already to pay compulsory union fees amounting to $119.50 a year before they are allowed to study. All students should ask themselves where the $100,000 odd will be found, should the union join NUS. Either the union is going to have to cut services and thus break election promises, like the Labor government, or it is going to have to raise its union fees. Whichever way is chosen, it is going to be the rank and file student who is going to lose out, either through general fee increases or cutbacks. You can bet your bottom dollar that trendy pet causes like the women's collective and the gay/lesbian/bi refuge will be shielded. Anyway, why should money paid by UQ students in Brisbane go to professional student organisers based in Melbourne?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the UQ union decides to join NUS, students should take note of the move here in Canberra to disaffiliate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no more common theme in Australian politics than the states crying poor mouth over federal funding. These are the same state governments which refused the Commonwealth's offer last year at the Darwin COAG meeting of $700 million in compensation for the introduction of national competition policies. They claimed compensation of $5 billion and called in the Industry Commission as an independent referee. The result of the report by the referee then came in. Last Friday the state Premiers agreed that no compensation was warranted; that is, they turned down cold the Commonwealth offer and missed the opportunity for additional funding of $700 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the revenue problems of the states are discretionary and self-inflicted. In my own state of New South Wales, for instance, there are $500 million worth of payroll tax exemptions within the state budget. I want to provide to the House a further instance of state government financial mismanagement. Last week there emerged an instance of wasted federal grants in health. Let me provide the background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the New South Wales government agreed to and signed up for the federal government's casemix development program. For the past seven years they have cooperated with the program and received approximately $6 million in federal grants. In fact, in answer to a question on notice by the state member for Moorebank, Craig Knowles, the New South Wales health minister, Mr Phillips, on 26 October last year, provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advantage of incorporating casemix into the budget process is to have an output related basis on which to allocate funding rather than rely on historical costs which may or may not fund appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to provide instances where casemix budgets were being introduced at Hornsby, Manly, Mona Vale and Ryde hospitals; how it was being introduced throughout the North Sydney area health service and pilots were also operating in the Illawarra health service. The minister concluded his answer by saying that the casemix models would continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix, of course, represents a simple but effective change in the financing of hospitals. The traditional method of funding fixed annual allocations unrelated to output simply institutionalises hospital inefficiency. Hospitals would invariably increase their waiting lists as a means of attracting additional government funding. Casemix funding, which pays hospitals according to the services they perform&mdash;their output&mdash;provides a strong incentive to increase activity and cut hospital waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, case payments are the only way in which the public hospital system has been able to manage the 11 per cent real reduction in hospital funding by the Kennett government. Case payments in Victoria have increased productivity by 10 per cent and lowered waiting lists across the board by 15 per cent. But what happened in New South Wales last Tuesday? The health minister, Mr Phillips, announced that he would no longer proceed with the casemix reforms. That is, he threw away $6 million of federal funding for that purpose allocated over the last six years. On the one hand he turned down the opportunity for a 10 per cent efficiency gain in the New South Wales system, yet on the other hand he tried to convince the public that the Liberal Party in New South Wales would improve hospital services with the same amount of outlays. He also complained that it was the federal government that was not providing enough hospital financing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no question that the New South Wales hospital system would be enhanced in all matters of efficiency and equity by the introduction of this federal based reform. In fact, output funding would advantage, in particular, outer metropolitan hospitals that are currently struggling with their throughput and patient volumes. It is regrettable, when an area such as the south-west of Sydney has 2.4 beds per thousand population while the east Sydney region has 6.7 hospital beds per thousand, the New South Wales government is throwing away a reform that would improve efficiency and allocate more hospital resources to the regions that have the highest demand in terms of patients and hospital throughput. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely regrettable that the government in New South Wales would totally waste $6 million of federal grants, throw away the opportunity for $700 million at the Darwin COAG but still turn around and say it is the federal government's fault. That is a joke. </PARA>

The letter by the Australian Bureau of Statistics began with that immortal phrase, `I am writing to ask you for help.'

It really means, `I am from the government and you had better answer my questions&mdash;or else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on my feet, and having listened to the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) about the New South Wales situation, I think it is important to put on the record the fact that the New South Wales coalition government has produced multitudinous improvements in the conditions of ordinary people in my own state. Some 57 new schools have been opened and there is record spending of $5.8 billion under the Liberal coalition government. The Environment Protection Authority now has a budget of $68 million and a staff of 738. Under the Labor government, it had a budget of a mere $12 million&mdash;and we all know what happened to the environment in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Werriwa talks about transport. Under the last Labor government in New South Wales, taxpayers were losing $3 million a day and the annual cost was more than $1 billion in losses by State Rail. Those losses have been cut by half a billion dollars. More than 25 per cent of rail services ran late under the last Labor government and, now, 94 per cent of them run on time. Under Labor, one car was stolen every eight minutes and there was a break and enter every five minutes. Under the Liberal coalition government, 1,600 extra police are now on the streets and truth in sentencing means that a life sentence is just that&mdash;a life sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by mentioning the subject of casemix, something dear to the heart of the member for Werriwa. The fact is that the Kennett government has introduced a system of casemix. I do not want to comment on the pluses and minuses of the casemix system, except to say that it is a system that has been introduced by the Kennett government. That is precisely what the member for Werriwa wants the New South Wales government to adopt. If Jeff Kennett has done it there must be a lot in favour of it but it is very interesting that the member for Werriwa has lined up with Jeff Kennett. I am very happy about that but I wonder whether the member for Werriwa is really doing the right thing by his manipulators and controllers in the New South Wales Right, endorsing so fulsomely the policies of the Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett. I congratulate him for it, nonetheless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to say a few words this evening, I would like to praise the courageous stand and leadership taken by Mr Albert Haakfort, Jim Price and Jim Edlington of Mount Isa and Jack Fraser, Eddie Lee and Ken Crisp of Cloncurry who have taken the leadership in fighting the proposals for the fly-in of workers to the new mines that are opening up in the Gulf of Carpentaria hinterland&mdash;the Mount Isa-Cloncurry area. As my colleague, the member for Maranoa (Mr Scott) would tell the House, we have lost something like 30 or 40 per cent of our population in the last 20 or 30 years. Whilst some of it has been the result of movement from cattle to sheep, the fact is that the population has gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last four years we have probably accounted for about 10 per cent of that population because of the disastrous impositions upon country people and the removal of services by the incoming socialist government in Queensland. Mount Isa and Cloncurry at least have the chance of turning things around because there are some 2,000 jobs up for grabs there. The government that I was a member of in Queensland banned fly-ins to Charters Towers, and Charters Towers picked up 1,200 jobs. We banned fly-ins to Emerald and we saw that queen city of the inland grow from 6,000 people&mdash;the honourable member for Maranoa is nodding his head&mdash;to nearly 12,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the growth in Emerald was that not only the business people in the town and the church leaders in the town but, in the case of Emerald, the trade union leadership fought. I am very pleased to see the CFMEU taking leadership in north-west Queensland at the present moment. Ken Crisp is also a trade union official. As well, the churches were represented. I think every church group was represented in Mount Isa. The point they make, which I think is the same point the union makes, is that we took two generations of children from the black people of the peninsula and gulf country; now we are proceeding to take the fathers from the children of the present inhabitants. It was not a very successful experiment in the case of the black people and I am damned sure it is not going to be a very successful experiment with the population of the gulf country today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the shareholders and the boards of the companies whose managements are proposing this to their shareholders that they are being conned. I rang the most clever, astute and able mining manager in Australia and asked him about this issue. I said, `What do you think about running a mine near Burketown from Brisbane&mdash;and I am referring to Century Zinc?' He said, `If a person walked through my door and proposed that to me, he would not walk out the door without a signed statement of resignation on my table.' He also said, `To suggest for one moment that even middle management, such as the foremen and leading hands, could be based in Brisbane is as stupid as suggesting the work force should be based in Brisbane when the mine is near Burketown.' You can almost watch the waves roll in at Century Zinc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also note that these are the people who are portraying the interests of their shareholders and the interests of the Australian nation badly because these mines will simply not function or perform in any way that is acceptable. We have never had a happy day at Mount Isa since the management moved away from the city and into the big southern capital of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the leadership of these towns, I give the warning that things are going to grow increasingly unpleasant if we do not have a change of attitude. We have no movement from the state government&mdash;the architect of destruction in inland Queensland. We most certainly have had a situation precipitated by the ridiculous fringe benefits tax that levies an imposition upon people who want to provide services to their own employees and enable their employees to go home and have a family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the proposal that is being put forward will remove fathers who are working on the mine fields in the gulf country of Queensland from the family unit. We are talking about 6,000 or 7,000 workers who will ultimately be involved throughout this region. It will be a very sad day for Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time available to me, I want to throw the spotlight once again on the ridiculous situation the government has created in relation to superannuation funds, particularly occupational funds. We heard recently that Australia taxes voluntary or discretionary savings at the highest level in the OECD. It is an incredible situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been noted before and deserves revisitation that the level of fees charged by many institutions to set up and manage occupational funds is excessive, often leading to the complete eradication of any so-called benefits accrued during the time of membership. For example, let us take the cases of just two of my constituents&mdash;Mr Greg Boyd and Mr Trevor Freeman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take Mr Boyd's case first because his situation demonstrates very well the differences in the way funds siphon off funds of these kind. Mr Boyd received an annual membership statement from the Norwich Union Superannuation Trust, into which his employer, a courier company, had been contributing the compulsory super requirement. Over the 1993-94 financial year, this amounted to $694, all being superannuation guarantee contribution payments. From this, Norwich deducted $60 in membership fees; a $138.80 contribution fee; $2.89 in asset fees; $52 in death and disability insurance, which is fair enough; and another $66.05 in contributions tax. This left Mr Boyd with a grand total of $368.21, almost exactly half of the contributions paid into his account by his employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is the SGC trying to guarantee a future for? Not Mr Boyd and others like him. More likely this is a scheme designed to guarantee the continuing existence of superannuation funds that charge fees such as this. In contrast, Mr Boyd left that employer and worked for another company which also paid occupational super through the SGC scheme. This policy was held with Legal and General's SuperEasy. Between May and September 1994, Mr Boyd's company contributions totalled $140.72. After deduction of insurance, contribution fees and tax, Mr Boyd received $93.89, a far better outcome than his previous fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While no-one can argue that fees of varying types are part and parcel of insurance and superannuation, the level and diversity of these are staggering. On the one hand, some funds seem to charge reasonable and sensible fees, while other companies leave employees with greatly reduced funds. If superannuation companies do not want to service the small operator why is this government forcing them to&mdash;thus allowing the more unscrupulous to profit from small investors?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Government Business Enterprises, including Telstra, are not required to purchase against DAS arrangements. I am advised by Telstra that the Company requires that any product sourcing arrangements entered into must represent best value for money. All Telstra product sourcing recommendations are required to be extensively evaluated. As part of this evaluation, the Corporate Sourcing Unit, which is responsible for arranging product sourcing agreements, compares the offer against any Purchasing Australia arrangements which may exist and often uses these as a benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra has advised that they have devolved some responsibility for purchasing decisions to Business Units under appropriate delegations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)(ii) No, Telstra maintains a central accounting asset register to meet both its accounting and tax requirements. While there are no accounting or taxation requirements to maintain a register of leased assets, Telstra includes these assets in a fixed asset register. Telstra's policy is that all commercially attractive non-communication assets whether owned or leased are registered so as to enable management to exercise physical control over such assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)(iii) Telstra has established national sourcing contracts and agreements for a range of products and services to maximise its buying power and to ensure availability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) No problems were encountered with the outright purchase of equipment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Incentive products were included in some purchasing of office equipment. After preliminary inquiries by Telstra, information relating to leasing arrangements has been forwarded to the Victorian Police to see if there were any criminal actions that could be pursued in relation to this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Telstra has also held discussions with five leading photocopier companies. These discussions led to many leasing arrangements being adjusted in Telstra's favour or refunds being provided which offset any premiums charged for incentives. The value of these favourable adjustments was approximately $1.3 million in Telstra's favour. This represented an 8 per cent reduction in leasing exposure for photocopiers and facsimile machines, which now stands at approximately $15 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government agreed as part of the reforms of Government Business Enterprises that Telstra not be bound by DAS purchasing arrangements.

At the time of entering into these arrangements, the equipment available on Purchasing Australia (DAS) contracts was taken into consideration.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An estimate of the approximate cost to relocate RAAF Base Williamtown to a new site is of the order of $550M. RAAF Base Williamtown is the home base of the Tactical Fighter Group and the training requirements of the Group dictate a need for the base to have ready access to adequate air space and an Air Weapons Range. The location of the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range adjacent to RAAF Base Williamtown was a key factor in the decision to base the F/A-18 Hornet aircraft at Williamtown. Any alternative site would require similar proximity to such a range.</PARA>
