<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the implementation of a national savings policy that provides incentive and reward to all members of the work force. However, there must be access to the benefits of superannuation for all employees, regardless of gender or position in the work force. In his recent statement at the launch of the superannuation education program, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give an example, someone on average weekly earnings now&mdash;that's someone on about $32-$33,000&mdash;when they retire, they will retire on a lump sum just under half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>This illustrates the extent to which the government is exaggerating the benefits that will flow to Australia's work force from its current retirement savings policies. In marketing the benefits and the opportunities that will flow from a widespread commitment to a national savings policy, there is no room for gilding the lily and providing false hope to thousands of individual superannuants and their families that superannuation is their retirement nirvana. Nothing could be further from the truth for the greater proportion of today's work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation represents only one aspect of a well-balanced retirement plan, and it cannot and must not be promoted as the complete answer to the provision of adequate income in retirement. The subdued confidence in the ability of superannuation to satisfy the retirement incomes of working Australians is such that it cannot be projected as being the saviour to the retirement dilemma confronting an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent Australian Taxation Office survey revealed that young people between 18 and 25 believe that it is too early to be involved in superannuation; that those aged between 25 and 45 believe that they have too many other financial commitments; and that those aged between 45 and 55 believe that it is too late to start saving for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the major beneficiaries of superannuation are males employed in the work force full time. The FitzGerald report on national savings to the government suggested that an individual's level of saving of at least 18 per cent would be required in order to achieve sufficient income in retirement to provide for oneself. At this level an individual must work full time for at least 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not fit with the pattern of women's working lives and subsequently leaves them in a disadvantaged position. When the effects of disjointed career patterns and extended periods of part-time or casual employment experiences are combined, the average number of years in paid employment for women is 17 compared with 39 for men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is inherent discrimination against women in current superannuation arrangements that the government's policies simply do not address. This is born of the government's lack of understanding, or possibly appreciation, of the difficulties experienced by women through the course of their working lives. Women's typical employment and career profiles mean that they have fewer years in which they can contribute to their superannuation fund. It is therefore axiomatic that their level of savings will be significantly less than those of individuals who have benefited from full-time continuous participation in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To overcome this disadvantage, women would have to contribute to their superannuation fund at a higher level for a longer period of time to bridge the gap. However, when it is considered that women's pay is 15 per cent less in Australia today than for men's comparable work and that women experience greater income fluctuations during their working lives, it is not practical to expect that women have any realistic ability to make up for the disjointed nature of their employment and income generation gaps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, for the majority of the population, their retirement income consisted of the age pension, a range of fringe benefits such as free health benefits, reduced telephone charges and property rates, and reductions on electricity, gas and water rates. Under this environment, those individuals who experienced stable career employment generally enjoyed higher levels of income and living standards in retirement. However, these arrangements militate against women who are not adequately provided for in their retirement needs. Many women, whether in or out of the work force, do not reap the advantages offered to the people in long-term stable career positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For women, full-time or part-time work is inextricably linked with interruptions to their working lives caused by maternity leave and periods of child rearing; other family reasons, including caring for the elderly members of their family; substitution of full- and part-time employment during critical periods of their family's development; reintegration into the work force when their families become independent of close parental supervision; the difficulties experienced due to family disputes and divorce; and the requirement for many women to care for the terminally ill or people who have long-term illnesses. Miss Sue Walpole, who is the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women can work for 30 years, join superannuation funds in all their jobs and still find `next to nothing' in their retirement payouts from traditional employer contributions.</PARA>
<PARA>She stated that the current Sex Discrimination Act exempts activity in respect of superannuation that is blatant sex discrimination against women. She further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could mean for example that a woman could work for 30 years. She could be a member of the super scheme of every employer she ever worked for, but she could find when she retires that she gets next to nothing of what her various employers have contributed along the way.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, it has been estimated that women earn approximately 83 per cent of the amount calculated as necessary for self-funded retirement but 80 per cent of women earn less than this figure, which is a reflection of the fact that women are heavily concentrated in certain occupations and industries such as health and community services, retail and service industries which have a high degree of part-time and casual employment and consequent lower levels of remuneration. These industries depend on and benefit from the large pool of women seeking this form of employment or those who have no real alternative employment actions. Ethnic women and women with low skills levels, especially non-English speaking background women, also represent a higher proportion of women employed in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of an adequate level of retirement income for all Australians through self-funded retirement savings is simply not achievable. A recent study by the former head of Treasury, Mr Tony Cole, indicated that women on average earnings of $33,000 will have to accept a 35 per cent cut in living standards when they retire, despite this year's budget promises that the superannuation guarantee charge will eventually allow these people to retire on the equivalent of full average earnings. That is the bad news that the government glosses over and makes scant comment about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Cole's research did suggest was that lower paid women collect more from the age pension and the superannuation guarantee charge in retirement income than they did in wages. This does nothing to advance the idea that superannuation should assist people to become independent of the pension. But for women on 50 per cent of average earnings, notably those on permanent part-time hours, the combination of the age pension and the superannuation guarantee charge will lift their income in retirement by four percentage points to 54 per cent of average weekly earnings. In today's dollars, that is an increase of $25.79, lifting average weekly earnings to $348.14 per week&mdash;no fortune and no comparison to the male equivalent wage, which is somewhere around $644 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Cole's study also revealed that women on average earnings would earn just 20 per cent more in retirement income from the age pension and the superannuation guarantee charge, even though they earn 50 per cent more in wages than their part-time colleagues. Average earners would get a retirement income that is 65 per cent of their previous wage. In other words, their living standards would fall by 35 per cent after they finish work. In all the analysis of the outcomes of the government's continued fiddling with the superannuation guarantee charge, the only analysis that is ever undertaken is that which highlights the negative or paltry benefits to women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is very little analysis of the negative impact of the superannuation guarantee charge on the livelihoods of men, because they are not subject to the same degree of employment discrimination or disadvantage as women, nor are their careers affected by maternity and family caring activities to anywhere near the same extent as women. The government has demonstrated that, despite its continued rhetoric and meddling with the superannuation guarantee charge, it is unable to remove the discrimination against women and introduce genuine equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we return to an analysis of the Prime Minister's recent statement undertaken by my colleague the shadow minister for superannuation, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), it is evident that such generous end benefits depend on critical assumptions, including the age of the contributors. The Prime Minister's package assumes a steady rate of CPI growth of three per cent, wages growth of four per cent and a generous fund earning rate of seven per cent. Any variation in these figures will render achieving a $500,000 payout in real, rather than nominal, terms difficult to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, according to Treasury's own estimates, to achieve this sum a contributor would have to enter the work force in seven years time at the age of 25 when the government's superannuation scheme is fully implemented and work full time on average wages for at least 40 years after the year 2002. On this basis, today's workers cannot expect to own or benefit from the Prime Minister's heavily fertilised money tree. Yet the Prime Minister is unashamedly leading all Australians to believe that such benefits are immediately achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many women will be unlikely to receive a benefit anywhere near the amount touted by the Prime Minister, given that their annual average income is about half that of men and that many women spend long periods out of the work force. On average, women spend just 17 years in paid employment compared with 39 years for men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just women who are affected. No worker under the compulsory superannuation scheme in their late forties or on average weekly earnings could accumulate sufficient superannuation savings necessary to keep them in retirement. Even someone aged 50 and earning $80,000 a year would have to save at least 20 per cent of their salary to accumulate $490,000 in today's dollars by age 65. What chance have women on 50 per cent of average weekly earnings got of achieving the prime ministerial dream?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Accord Mark VIII, a worker on the lowest award rate who receives the Accord safety net pay increases but makes employee superannuation contributions in 1998 will, in real terms, be $8.25 a week worse off by the end of the Accord. Employees not covered by awards will simply miss out. Furthermore, growth in employment is favouring part-time rather than full-time work. Over 25 per cent of the work force is now in part-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a growing proportion of the work force, Mr Keating's grand design of a half a million dollar retirement benefit is as fanciful as Mr Hawke's promise that after 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. There has not been any consistency or stability in the policy, which shows a lack of understanding and a contempt for individuals' planning. As well, there are compliance and administration aspects of the management of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses, which employ 47 per cent of all Australians, are besieged with complicated and time consuming administration of their employees' superannuation entitlements. A lack of portability of policies further adds to the administration inefficiencies confronted by the business sector, which is an addition to the disadvantages that a lack of portability brings to low income, casual, itinerant and seasonal employees and, in particular, to many women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having established a complex regulatory regime to manage a superannuation system largely based upon compulsion, the government should ensure that contributors have greater freedom of choice. Importantly, the savings regime must be efficient and encourage maximum utilisation of resources devoted to this form of savings which includes management of funds, as well as the administration and compliance costs associated with all aspects of individual superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contributors should have the right to choose their superannuation funds subject to the employer agreement and to access retirement savings accounts supplied by approved financial intermediaries. With women, in particular, this is a difficult area because, as I say, women hold most of the part-time jobs, although men are beginning to play catch up. For those women who might have many different jobs in the span of their lifetime rather than one continuous or maybe two or three jobs over that period of time, the necessity for portability of policy and for small sums earned&mdash;retirement savings account&mdash;is a critical issue. It would be one way that we would be able to deliver to women a little more equity than we see in the present superannuation scheme. It is Australia's women who would benefit immediately from such initiatives which the coalition has identified as being one way of increasing equity and surety in Australia's retirement policies, particularly with respect to achieving very positive outcomes for women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank members who have contributed to the debate. There have been a number of speakers and, whilst the provisions we are dealing with on the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill are limited, the range of the debate has certainly been broad, to say the least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that the detailed measures of the bill received more than the briefest mention by any speakers during their contribution. But it has provided everyone with a chance to talk about superannuation issues. It is a pity, given that there were eight speakers from the opposition, that we did not hear during the debate some advance in their policy on superannuation matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, they have not moved one inch from their existing policy, one assumes, of freezing superannuation guarantee arrangements, which was their policy at the last election. If that was the case, as has been pointed out by a number of speakers in the debate, the effect would be that someone looking forward to a superannuation contribution equivalent to 15 per cent of wages by the year 2002 would have that frozen at the five to six per cent rate at June next year. Clearly, from our point of view and from a national savings point of view, that is a totally unacceptable position. We certainly reject that approach. It is high time that the opposition provided some detail on their policy in the whole superannuation area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other things were raised in the course of the debate that I should respond to as well. The first related to the government's public education program, which drew comment from a few of the speakers. I make the point at the outset that this program of education follows extensive research that the tax office had undertaken. It also follows extensive calls for better public education about superannuation on the part of the Liberal chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who referred to the issue at the ASFA conference last year. I quote from the Senate select committee chairman, Liberal senator John Watson. Recommendation 12.1 of the 15th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, a report of last February, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government ensure that appropriately targeted education programs be maintained to dispel confusion and uncertainty about superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>The government went through and researched carefully the whole approach to superannuation&mdash;what the community did understand and where there was a need for more information. That formed the basis of the public education program that is now being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That research highlighted the fact that the public was concerned about a number of aspects of superannuation, even though they gave overwhelming support to the whole provision of superannuation, including the employee contribution, the employer contribution and the government matching contribution that was announced at budget time this year. As a result of that research, the campaign has been drawn together to target all of the community, but particularly looking at the role of trustees, fund managers, advisers, small business employers, et cetera&mdash;all of whom have a key role in making sure that better understanding of superannuation arrangements is spread right across the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than seeking to denigrate that process, I would have thought the opposition would stick to what it was asking for in those reports as recently as the last few months; that is, greater community education about the whole program. We still have not had any commitment from the opposition to match the 15 per cent contribution that the government has now identified as part of its package. One of the things the research clearly did show was desired by the community was the opposition's taking a bipartisan approach and ensuring that no-one would be worse off as a result of the opposition approach. That that has not been done&mdash;we have not had any advance in policy in this area&mdash;is one of the major concerns the community has raised, based on the research that has been conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we went to the next stage, which was about whether various commitments regarding the quantum of superannuation benefit that had been talked about would be delivered. Research and analysis work was done for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving for our future</EMPHASIS> document released at the time of the budget, and in other research work done since then. One thing you cannot get away from in this debate is that no-one disputes the fact that having a net addition of superannuation saving in addition to part pension for many Australians, particularly women, will mean a net major benefit in retirement for them. It will mean a net additional income in retirement for each of those people who have superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the opposition has focused on the example of the person who comes in at 2002 and then works for 40 years and uses a figure for that&mdash;that figure is calculated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving for our future</EMPHASIS> document&mdash;in addition, the calculation is made as to net benefit someone aged 40 would gain, someone aged 50 would gain, et cetera. Of course, that is true. We are moving from a situation of 40 per cent of people with superannuation in 1983&mdash;that was the Liberals' legacy&mdash;to a figure today of 93 per cent. We also note that we have gone from a situation where less than 25 per cent of women had superannuation a decade ago while today the figure is something like 76 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things can only be reinforced if there is a commitment on the part of the opposition to ensure that no-one is going to be worse off as a result of any approach they might take. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in his contribution referred to the article by George Megalogenis in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It says, `Battlers will be the first to fall into Howard's super trap.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really up to the opposition to demonstrate that they are not going to let that occur. The community has called for that both in the government's research and in the research conducted by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. The way to stop that concern is for the opposition to give a clear, categoric commitment that they will follow through with the 15 per cent contribution arrangement that the government has adopted as part of the budget measures, the superannuation guarantee and the government matching contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, none of the eight speakers from the opposition referred to that. However, a number of speakers referred to women and superannuation, so I quote from a press release on 30 June this year by Susan Ryan, the Chief Executive of ASFA, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory superannuation heralds as much significance for women as the equal pay decision of 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since superannuation became compulsory most women workers now have a superannuation account of their own. These accounts will grow, if not to provide fully for retirement, at least to be a welcome supplement to the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a giant leap forward compared to earlier days when women lacked access to superannuation or were likely to be bound up in discriminatory superannuation schemes, or had to rely on the husband's superannuation in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, superannuation has become the prerogative of female part-time, casual workers who dominate many areas of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key budget measures was the government's matching contribution to superannuation. Those who are already contributing three per cent or more directly themselves to a superannuation fund&mdash;including many nurses and others in the public sector&mdash;will get the matching three per cent contribution from the government without needing to contribute any further. So, again, there will be a net benefit and significant equity assistance as far as superannuation arrangements and provision for women are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference was also made in the debate to fund investment performance and the need for greater choice in these areas. A number of speakers referred to the fact that there are calls from time to time about more directed investment or government intervention in how funds should be invested. I have said in previous debates that, if you go back through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> over the last 40 years, you will find that various people from all sides of parliament at different times have said superannuation investment should be the subject of greater scrutiny, direction or whatever both by regulators and/or government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made clear&mdash;and I reiterate&mdash;the government's longstanding position that superannuation fund investment is a matter for the trustees who are accountable to their members. We have made it clear through the industry supervision act that there are clear guidelines on the role of the trustees and their accountability. But then it becomes a matter that the trustees need to take appropriate advice and ensure the range of investment strategies are developed to get the optimum performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that you do not just look at last year's particular results. Obviously there was a range of factors in superannuation investment in 1994, but the fact is that in the first seven months of 1995 we have seen a significant turnaround in that performance, as we had indeed for the last four or five years before 1994. So it is important not to have too much of a short-term approach when looking at investment performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference was made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to certain matters with the Western Australian Water Authority superannuation fund. They were important issues the member for Curtin raised and I share some of his concerns. I too have had representations from members of those funds about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to the member for Curtin that the issues he raised and the problems he identified in his remarks are indeed the responsibility of the Western Australian government. I, like others, have written to the Western Australian minister asking that he fully consider the matters raised by the members of those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Government Employees Superannuation Act 1987 is not supervised by the Commonwealth but is a Western Australian government entity. The vesting rules of the WA government fund mean that employees being shifted to the private sector will receive a much smaller benefit than those who remain with the Western Australian government. I certainly think this is an unacceptable situation and that the problem of resolving these matters lies with the Western Australian government and its Premier&mdash;Premier Court. It will probably come as no surprise to the member for Curtin to know that, to date, efforts to have that matter adequately addressed have not received worthy or satisfactory attention. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that appears to be the case, as the Assistant Treasurer reminds the House. The member for Curtin also referred to questions relating to fees and charges eating away at small balances. Therefore, I reiterate that from 1 July this year special measures were introduced that provide protection for superannuation accounts with balances of under $1,000 from being reduced by fees and charges. Those arrangements are working well. It is clear that the provisions have been well received by the industry, and they certainly have been well received by the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key things we are pursuing as part of our public education program is explanation of the rules relating to those small accounts member protection arrangements. Given the success that has been achieved with those arrangements to date, better community understanding and, therefore, stronger success in those provisions will be ensured in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also reference by a number of speakers to the portability provisions of superannuation and the need for more emphasis on the transfer protocol, as it is termed, between superannuation funds. The government does see the transfer protocol as being particularly important. To date, we have received advice that 22 funds&mdash;particularly a number of the major industry funds&mdash;intend to enter into the transfer protocol. We certainly welcome the fact that that initiative has been taken. I note that ASFA has plans to do considerably more work, with seminars around the country and programs to be part of its national conference in November, to further enhance the provisions of and accessibility to the transfer protocol. We certainly welcome the progress that has been made by those key funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that one thing that does need to happen is for the portability arrangements, the transfer arrangements, to be carried through as promptly as possible. I take the opportunity to urge funds and their trustees to pursue the transfer protocol arrangements with the utmost vigour because that is one of the key matters the industry needs to respond to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I note that some of the leaders with the transfer protocol and member protection have been the industry funds&mdash;not the union funds, as often we have been told by some of the opposition speakers. The fact is that we do not have union funds but industry funds with equal employee and employer representation. They are some of the key pacesetters in the provision of service, including the provision of portability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than the continuing denigration of those funds which have been the key drivers in the competitive nature of superannuation, we should be giving them credit where they are achieving positive things. A number of articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last week just highlighted how constructive and positive the industry funds have been in their contribution. We welcome their role in superannuation, just as we welcome the role of life offices and banks. They are all playing their part, and the asset growth across each sector in superannuation has been significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are not going to have two sets of regulatory rules applying to superannuation. We are going to ensure that the provisions that apply are comparable for each of those players, and we encourage them all to look at the competitive nature of the industry and to provide full value to all superannuation fund members. With those words, I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill contains a number of proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 which arise from the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1993 federal election</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled on 16 November 1994. The government response to this report was tabled in the 1995 winter sittings. Some of the matters dealt with in the committee's report which are of a minor or technical nature and which require legislative amendment have been taken up in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 1 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second bill will allow greater flexibility and efficiency in the method used by the Australian Electoral Commission for the conduct of electoral roll reviews. Rather than being required to undertake a full roll review every two years, the commission will also be empowered to conduct reviews targeted to areas of high population movement or lower than expected enrolment instead of, or as well as, full national roll reviews. The commission will also be able to conduct reviews using other methods in addition to the traditional visits to habitations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow electors who are going overseas to apply to register as eligible overseas electors within three months of their expected departure or within one year after the actual date of departure. At present, electors who are going overseas must apply within one month of expected departure and, if they do not, they cannot apply once they have departed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will extend the time for the close of rolls from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. on the day the rolls close for an election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure that the death or withdrawal of a candidate who is one of a number bulk nominated will not invalidate the nomination of the remaining bulk nominated candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow for the dispatch of postal ballot materials to all registered general postal voters immediately after the declaration of nominations. Currently, only those general postal voters who are registered as unable to sign their name are sent postal ballot material directly. All other general postal voters are sent an application for a postal vote, with postal ballot materials sent only on the return of the application. This process can disenfranchise some people who rely on the post to exercise their right to vote, especially those in remote areas where the postal services are infrequent and sometimes unreliable. The government will be proposing a minor amendment with respect to this issue to correct a drafting oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill as introduced adopts the joint standing committee's recommendation to extend the right to enrol and vote to all prisoners other than those who have been convicted of treason or treachery and have not been pardoned. As notified by the Acting Prime Minister, the Hon. Kim Beazley MP, on 10 July, the government will not be proceeding with this amendment. The government accordingly proposes introducing a government amendment to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in doing so, the government proposes introducing an amendment to the bill which will make workable the administration of the existing provisions regarding prisoner disqualification. The existing provisions provide for disqualification based on the maximum sentence which could have been imposed. To be properly administered, this would require a detailed study of the indications from the sentencing judge of the indictments and the sentencing judge's decision. The cost of such procedures would be prohibitive. The amendment the government proposes, and which until recently the opposition supported but now no longer supports, will provide that the disqualification be based on the actual sentence imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill as introduced also allows for the commencement  of the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes on the  Monday preceding polling day, and for a prohibition on canvassing within six metres of the entrance to a divisional office or pre-poll voting centre. Following discussions with the opposition and the Australian Democrats raising certain practical difficulties with this proposal, the government intends moving amendments to withdraw these proposals from the bill. Finally, the bill will also make a number of amendments of a minor technical nature. I therefore commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) has pointed out, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 essentially amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the machinery for the referendum provisions. It arises from the recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1993 federal election report of inquiry into the conduct of the federal election and matters related thereto</EMPHASIS>. Essentially, therefore, the legislation is of an administrative nature. There are, however, a number of points, the most important one being the question of prisoner voting, upon which the opposition will be moving two substantive amendments to change the provisions in the government amendments limited to five years to be further limited to 12 months. I shall discuss that in greater detail later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main provisions of the bill relate to giving the Electoral Commission greater flexibility in conducting electoral roll reviews. Over the years this has been a matter of some contention on occasions. There is especially a risk that, if a sudden election is brought forward, as is always the right of a government, there are times when electoral rolls have simply not been adequately cleansed in time for the election and consequently in key electorates, where the vote may be determined by literally a handful of voters, there is legitimate concern that if you do not have a reasonably up-to-date electoral roll review process there is a probability that people are voting who may not be eligible so to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill as it currently stands also allows prisoners, other than those convicted of treason or treachery and who have not been pardoned, to enrol to vote provided they meet the normal qualifications for enrolment. There is a slight variation to this. As I understand it, under the arrangements, contrary to other people, a prisoner can choose the residence at which they wish to be registered for voting, whereas in our view it would be more sensible if they were able to use the previous address prior to their imprisonment. As I said, this is an issue which I will discuss in greater length in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current bill adopts the recommendations of the government members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that no prisoner should be deprived of the right to enrol to vote. As was mentioned by the minister, this matter has now been disagreed to by the government and it will be moving a different amendment. Under the Electoral Act, the Controller-General of prisons in each state is required to forward to the Australian Electoral Office or the Electoral Commissioner a list of all persons in the state sentenced for any offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other main provisions in the legislation which I want to refer to briefly allow an elector who is going overseas to apply for registration as an eligible overseas elector within three months preceding their expected date of departure. That would change the existing arrangements where we currently have a one-month application period and would allow an elector to apply for registration within one year after the actual date of departure. Where this is not previously possible in either case, registration remains limited for a period of three years from the actual date of departure. So it is quite clearly identifiable for people who are travelling and do not expect to be overseas for any great length of time, which may undermine eligibility to vote in Australian elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for the rolls for an election to close at 8 p.m. on the day of the close of rolls rather than 6 p.m. As a consequence, applications for registration as eligible overseas electors and itinerant electors would also close at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide that should a candidate, who is one of a number of bulk nominated candidates, die or be withdrawn before the nominations are declared, that candidate's death or withdrawal will not affect the nomination of the other candidates. There are several other administrative changes in relation to bulk nomination which are relevant, particularly to some of the smaller parties such as the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide that an elector who is caring for a person who is seriously ill or infirm and who is unable to attend a polling place to vote may apply to register as a general postal voter. However, this will not apply where the seriously ill or infirm person is in a hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that, following the closing of nominations, postal ballot papers and postal vote certificate envelopes shall be sent to all registered general postal voters. At present, only those registered general postal voters who are registered by virtue of being so physically incapacitated as to be unable to sign their name are sent this material. All other registered general postal voters currently receive an application for a postal vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also address the questions of canvassing which were referred to by the minister. It is proposed that canvassing be prohibited within six metres of a divisional office or a pre-polling voting office, respectively, during the hours that voting may take place in those offices. The effect of this amendment is consistent with the prohibition on canvassing near polling places on polling day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that persons interstate on polling day may vote during the ordinary hours for voting in that state or territory. This is particularly relevant because of the time zone variations across Australia. For example, a voter from New South Wales who happens to be in Western Australia on polling day may vote only between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. under the current arrangements despite the fact that the poll is open until 6 p.m. in that state. The time currently available to such an elector during the daylight saving months is 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. That amendment will be very helpful to many people who are travelling interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed to remove the requirement to gazette the time and date of visits to be made by remote mobile polling teams for the purpose of taking votes. The requirement for the gazettal of the places to be visited will remain. This will bring the gazettal provisions for remote mobile polling into line with the requirements for special hospital mobile polling. In addition, the gazettal of places to be visited can take place well in advance of the election. However, the time and the date of the visit are often not finalised until after the election day is in fact known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that every elector, who is a patient voting with a mobile polling team, in either a special hospital or a hospital that is a polling place, is to be informed of his or her right to be assisted in casting a vote. Such electors must still satisfy the presiding officer that they are in fact entitled to that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes may commence on the Monday prior to polling day. The amendment to paragraph 17 of schedule 3 is to ensure that the divisional returning officer cannot open the declaration envelopes until after the closing of the polls. The amendments also provide that the deposit as security against costs for filing a petition with the Court of Disputed Returns be raised from $100 to $500. This will assist in deterring vexatious and frivolous petitions, without deterring petitioners of limited means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the amendments provide that a person who is a party to a petition before the Court of Disputed Returns may appear either on their own behalf or be represented by counsel or a solicitor. The current provisions provide that a party may be represented by no more than one counsel or solicitor, and only on the agreement of all parties or by leave of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the amendments are largely technical and flow from those parts of the committee's report which received bipartisan support&mdash;we will be giving bipartisan support to the passage of this bill as a whole&mdash;we will be amending the part of the bill dealing with prisoner voting. In that context, I would like to draw the attention of the House to section 44 placitum (ii) of the Australian constitution which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any person who&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) . . . who has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be incapable of being chosen or sitting as a senator or member of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of that, we believe that the same basic principle should be applied to prisoners in Australian gaols. Consequently, the amendment I shall be moving will reduce the period from five years, which is part of the government's amendment, to 12 months. This will make the law uniform across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with altering a prisoner's eligibility for enrolment for consideration of maximum potential penalty for the actual sentence a particular prisoner has received. Consideration has to be given to the fact that, in the 1983 report, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform recommended amendments to the electoral act to amend the disqualification of persons convicted and under sentence for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer, to those undergoing sentence for offences punishable by imprisonment for five years or longer. As I have said, the decision has been taken to reverse that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with identifying prisoners retaining the franchise from those who are disqualified. Because of that, the committee reconsidered the first committees's recommendation on the issue of disqualification. Nevertheless, the decision has been made by the party room that there should be a clear and unequivocal position in Australian law which provides that, when people are in gaol for a period in excess of 12 months, their sentence should be related to their civil responsibilities and their civil privileges as a citizen by virtue of the fact that they have been found guilty. That they are in gaol is a factor which we should take into account in determining to what extent they should be entitled to vote in Commonwealth elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that a similar provision, I understand, also relates to prisoners under the New South Wales legal provisions. Therefore, there is a degree of continuity which we would like to see incorporated in the legislation at this point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains a number of practical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act arising from the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I would like to talk very briefly about a number of those because they are very much housekeeping matters, bar one or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes for roll reviews are very sensible. Currently, full reviews must be conducted every two years. These current arrangements are inflexible, do not allow for efficiencies and do not allow for targeting of high turnover and high growth rate areas or areas of known under-enrolment. They restrict the ability of the commission to target reviews close to electoral events and restrict the method of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments I think give much greater flexibility. Reviews will continue to be undertaken but there will be flexibility. Reviews will be able to target high growth areas, high turnover areas and known areas of under-enrolment. Areas of high turnover and growth can be reviewed more often, and areas of high turnover and high growth can be reviewed closer to elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there are some changes to eligible overseas electors. Currently, electors must apply to register as an eligible overseas elector within one month prior to departure. This amendment allows for application within three months prior to departure or 12 months after the date of departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another practical amendment is the hour of closure of the rolls. Currently, rolls close at 6 p.m. on the day of the roll closure. Many electors could miss out on enrolling simply because they cannot get to the AEC because of their work commitments. Closing at 8 p.m. is a sensible measure because it will enable those who cannot get to an office by 6 p.m. to do so. One has to ask why we have not moved an amendment such as this prior to now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment also allows for the submission of enrolment forms by fax machine. Currently, there is doubt as to whether enrolment applications can be received by fax. The amendment specifically provides that enrolment applications can be received by fax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also changes to bulk nomination deposits. Currently, bulk nomination deposits, if refunded, must be paid to the candidate regardless of who paid it&mdash;usually the political party branch organisation. This amendment will provide that the deposit is refunded to the person who paid it&mdash;who I am sure will be delighted with the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some changes affecting the circumstances where someone who is part of a bulk nomination dies. At present, the law is unclear as to the arrangements for dealing with the death of a bulk nominated candidate and the effect that the death may have on the validity of other candidates in the bulk nomination. This amendment makes clear that the remaining candidates are unaffected by the death of one or a number of bulk nominated candidates. As we saw in the last federal election, you can have this terrible circumstance in an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also not proceeding with the amendment extending the right to vote to all prisoners. As notified by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) on 10 July, the government is not proceeding with that amendment. This is a decision that I support and I wholeheartedly agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some changes to postal voting. There are two amendments regarding general postal voters. The first will allow those caring for a person who is seriously ill or infirm and who is unable to attend a polling place because of their caring duties to apply to be a general postal voter. The second amendment will allow postal ballot papers and postal vote certificates to be sent to all registered general postal voters without them first having to complete the application for a postal vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some changes relating to hours for pre-poll voting. They are the technical aspects of the bill which, as I said before, largely involve housekeeping. But, of course, this electoral act operates within the framework of our total electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has debated how fair our electoral system is and the extent to which it can sometimes be the subject of fraud. In fact many on the other side in the other house, most notably Senator Minchin and some of his colleagues, frequently complain that the system is rigged. Those complaints are usually loudest after each unsuccessful election campaign conducted by the conservative parties. What tends to follow is a chorus of claims that a massive fraud has been perpetrated on the system and that really the coalition did not lose the election but there was some electoral fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the deliberations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the conclusions that were reached on this important matter. Chapter 4 of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, entitled `Electoral integrity', states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, all objective evidence indicates that fraud is not a significant occurrence and did not influence any result at the 1993 federal election. The Committee therefore believes that many of the proposed changes to enrolment and voting procedures should be judged critically in terms of their cost, administrative problems and inconvenience to voters. To quote the AEC,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`some of the measures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the measures put forward by the Liberal Party which were rejected by the committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">discussed [would] tend disproportionately to affect underprivileged or marginal members of society. The burden of inconvenience on voters could well serve to reduce the high level of voluntary compliance with compulsory enrolment and voting which has largely been forthcoming in Australia. Both of these factors would tend to diminish rather than enhance the legitimacy of Australian election processes.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Liberal Party has been advocating a series of changes to our electoral procedures which would make it harder to enrol to vote, harder to participate in the electoral process, and in the process water down our commitment to compulsory voting. That is not surprising because the Liberals in recent times, breaking the Menzies tradition, have come out vehemently opposing compulsory voting. That is largely their reaction to their experience of electoral defeat in the 1980s and 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, in their twisted thought processes, have the view that they lost the elections because compulsory voting favours Labor and not the coalition. Of course that is nonsense but it has all been part and parcel of their inability to understand the reason for their successive electoral losses, which related not to the electoral system at all but to the fact that they put forward policies that the people of Australia could never agree with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, after each successive electoral defeat, they have rolled up to the electoral affairs committee with propositions about how the system is really rigged and how they would have been on the Treasury bench if we had a fair electoral system. Let us see what the joint standing committee had to say about this notion of fraud in the 1993 campaign. On page 31 of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were 535 cases where the elector admitted voting more than once.</PARA>
<PARA>We have to bear in mind that 11 million people vote. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of these cases, 443 were explainable by circumstances known to the AEC, such as age, infirmity and language difficulties. The remaining 92 cases of admitted multiple voting were referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the passing of these cases to the Federal Police, the Federal Police referred only one to the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;that is, the Federal Police decided that there was only one case for reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions involving fraud for multiple voting out of 11 million-plus voters. So I think this report does blow away so much that has been said by the conservative parties about the alleged deficiencies in the procedures and regulations surrounding our electoral system. There is no evidence of fraud whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you have to ask the question: why do they continue to perpetuate this myth in the face of the overwhelming evidence that has been put forward? Really it is part and parcel of their campaign against compulsory voting. They do not want it. They do not want compulsory voting because they think that is the reason they lose elections. It is not their policies; it is not their personnel; it is the system. Of course, we have seen so much of this nonsense peddled in my home state of Queensland in the last month or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact of the matter is that there is a powerful case for compulsory voting over voluntary voting which goes to the heart of what we want to be as a country. It goes to the heart of our lifestyle and to the heart of our democratic traditions. I guess the advocacy of voluntary voting that we are getting from people such as Senator Minchin and others really is very typical of the elitist philosophy that the conservatives now have&mdash;a complete rejection of all that Menzies stood for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that compulsory voting draws the political system to the centre. If that is the reason it favours Labor, it favours Labor because Labor has been in the centre. It is not the system; it is the policy. Compulsory voting does draw the political system to the centre. It dilutes the power of money raised by special interest groups. Where you have voluntary voting, it is very easy for special interest groups with big money to run the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So their advocacy of voluntary voting, I guess, is consistent with their Darwinian philosophy of the survival of the fittest, which goes to the heart of their approach not only to electoral affairs but also to their economic policy. It was that sort of philosophy, the survival of the fittest, that was at the heart of Fightback. It was the whole notion underlying the GST: that the rich and powerful are the only deserving members of the community and the only ones who should be making judgments about the policy directions in this country. There is no concept of fairness or social justice in their view of voluntary voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact it is the same sort of attitude as we find from them on the issue of bank fees and charges. Many members opposite say, `What are you complaining about with bank fees and charges? It's okay if the banks want to drive low income earners out of the banking system. There are deserving customers and non-deserving customers.' That is their view of the world. That is the philosophy behind voluntary voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the strength of compulsory voting is that it brings policy development and politicians fairly and squarely to the middle ground. Policy positions must be those that are acceptable to a majority, not a small minority who go out to vote with only special interests in their mind. The thing about voluntary voting is that it is a system which tends to entrench incumbents. That has certainly been the experience in other areas of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in the United States it does favour incumbents because, in a system of voluntary voting, all you have to do is get out your loyal supporters to vote. That is pretty good if you have the demography flowing with you. You do not have to concentrate necessarily on servicing the needs of others, the dispossessed or the vast middle ground who may decide not to vote. So all that happens in a system of voluntary voting is that like-minded people tend to stick together and the political system is drawn their way, away from necessarily the national interest or the centre ground. That system tends to lead to the breakdown of the party system, which is terrific for special interest groups. Once the party system breaks down, the whole system is run by money. Of course, that is the experience in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What tends to happen then is that vested interests fund individual campaigns, not the party. As a result, members of parliament, or Congress, become just representatives of particular special interest groups. Under that system those who have no significant economic power do not have any political clout whatsoever. That is what really gets up the noses of the Liberal and National parties about compulsory voting; they do not want people to have any clout. That goes back to the heart of their philosophy, as evidenced in their attitude to industrial relations, bank fees and charges, taxation and so many other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we get into a system of voluntary voting where very few people vote&mdash;and over time fewer and fewer people vote because the system less and less represents them&mdash;the whole political system ends up in a vicious downward spiral. Powerless sections of the community simply drop out, and those who do not vote tend to skew the system in favour of those who do. But they do not see any point in participating because they do not ever think that they can win. That is what the philosophy of the Liberal Party is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that compulsory voting has been an outstanding success in Australia. It gives far greater legitimacy to our political process. The political process in this country is far more legitimate than it is in many others. Before compulsory voting was introduced in Australia in the 1920s we used to have a relatively low turnout; something like 57.95 per cent of the electorate voted in the 1922 federal election. Following that low turnout, all parties in Australia supported compulsory voting. But now that consensus is fractured by, I guess, the far right elements in the Liberal Party reasserting their dominance on the policy debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party wants to go to a system such as we see in the United States where just over 50 per cent of the electorate turned out for the 1980 presidential election to elect Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was only elected by something like 35 per cent of those with the right to vote. In the 1983 British election Margaret Thatcher is said to have received a great landslide, but she received only 43.5 per cent of the votes cast, against 54.3 per cent gained by the anti-Conservative parties. Of course, that process owes a little bit to the system of first-past-the-post voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we get to a system of voluntary voting all the effort goes into getting the vote out. That suits the Liberal and National parties because the last thing they want to talk about is their hidden policy agenda. Compulsory voting brings the political system to the centre ground and it brings policy to the centre ground. It brings policy to the centre ground because it makes all people in the community think about what the alternative teams are going to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Liberal Party continues to lurch to the Right in its thought processes, if not in its public policies or policy pronouncements, it obviously knows that a system of compulsory voting will, in the end, bring about a much more detailed examination of what the opposing side stands for. The Liberal Party should be celebrating that as a good thing and not advocating a policy perspective which is simply elitist and un-Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 I would like to make a couple of general points and also comment briefly on some of the assertions of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan). The member for Lilley has expressed his support for compulsory voting and has asserted that the coalition's policy is to adopt voluntary voting. That is just not so. There is debate from time to time in the public arena about whether or not there ought to be compulsory or voluntary voting, and that is healthy. After all, we are in a democracy and many members hold the view that compulsory voting is appropriate in Australia at the moment; other members hold the view that voluntary voting is a better way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think they have the right to express that view, and I would encourage them to continue to do that, but the coalition does not have a policy to abandon compulsory voting. It would be quite inappropriate for the member for Lilley to go home at the end of this week lamenting the fact that compulsory voting is going to be abandoned by the coalition, the next government. That is not so. We have not made a policy decision in that area; I want to make that absolutely clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the shadow minister in Victoria for property and services responsible for electoral procedures. I remember debates at state council meetings of the Liberal Party on this issue. It is true that many people believe that a system of voting different from compulsion is more appropriate for a democracy such as Australia. I think that debate should continue. Both points of view need to be respected and taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was a guest of the Institute of Representative Government in America and, along with colleagues from both sides of the House, had the privilege of studying the American system of voting. I must say that I came back a little bit more aware of the complex presidential system. But I was very much convinced that the Australian system is better, despite some problems and weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very good to learn more about America's history and political procedures, and also to observe the dramatic changes in politics in America with the appointment of a majority of Republicans in both the Senate and the Congress for the first time in 40 years. America's legal discussions and the American scene are very much changed. Many people are not quite sure what is going to happen next. I recommend to all members of parliament that they keep their eyes on the United States and the political changes occurring there because they are dynamic and will obviously have a great influence on the world because of its role in trade and other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a fairly torrid time when I was shadow minister for these matters in Victoria. Part of the time I was shadow minister was the time of a by-election for that state's Legislative Council. During that by-election, certain people involved with the Labor Party had handed out bogus how-to-vote cards. That was quite an infamous incident in the Labor Party's history in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome was that the then Secretary of the Labor Party, a gentleman called Peter Batchelor&mdash;now a shadow minister in the Victorian opposition, surprisingly&mdash;was forced to confess that he had lied about his knowledge of the distribution of those bogus how-to-vote cards. In brief, he denied that he had had anything at all to do with them. As it turned out, he had been involved in arranging for them to be handed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What had happened was that candidates for the by-election professing to belong to a nuclear disarmament party had handed out how-to-vote cards with preferences on those cards going to the Labor candidate. Many people thought they were genuine cards and may have been influenced by them in the way they distributed their preferences. The outcome of the election was that the Liberal and Labor party candidates polled equal votes, believe it or not, in a by-election with about 85,000 voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were proceedings in the Court of Disputed Returns. Ultimately, the Liberal candidate, Rosemary Varty, was elected at another election and still serves very ably in the Victorian parliament. In fact, she is the Cabinet Secretary. That was an interesting incident, as a result of which the act was amended in an effort to close some of the areas abused by some people in the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulations were introduced limiting the type of card, requiring the how-to-vote cards to be registered with the electoral commissioner before the day of the election, regulating the place where the cards can be handed out and also prescribing certain distances from polling booths within which the cards had to be handed out. At the time I felt it was rather sad that, in a democracy like Australia, because of the behaviour of someone who had lied and who had been involved in the handing out of bogus cards&mdash;the Secretary of the Labor Party, who is now a member of parliament&mdash;the parliament saw fit to change the law and to introduce stricter regulations that, in effect, control freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit of a paradox to see parliaments wrestling with having to make new rules to control and to regulate voting in this democracy because people abuse the freedoms that we have. It just goes to show that, at all times, you have to be fairly zealous about protecting democracy&mdash;because it is a very fragile flower&mdash;and that sometimes parliaments have to intercede and introduce regulations as a result of some people's abuse of their privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the recent New South Wales state election I was asked to act as a scrutineer because, as you know, I live in Wodonga, Victoria, along the New South Wales-Victorian border. Victorian members of parliament, state and federal, are often asked to be involved in elections across the border. I have done that for years, as have many members of the Labor, Liberal and National parties, I am sure. I was asked to act as a scrutineer; I did so in good faith and behaved myself and contributed towards the scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that election the Liberal candidate, Ian Glachan, had a resounding win in the seat of Albury and convincingly defeated the Labor candidate, Mr Cameron. So that was cause for celebration, at least for people on my side of politics. However, unbeknown to me, the people involved in Mr Cameron's campaign in the Labor Party in New South Wales reported me to the State Electoral Office&mdash;and I think others as well&mdash;for acting as a scrutineer in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, apparently, was investigated&mdash;although I did not know I was being investigated&mdash;to see whether I had breached the New South Wales electoral act. It turns out that I had not breached the act. I received a very kind letter from Mr E.I. Dickson, New South Wales Electoral Commissioner, dated 14 August 1995. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Lieberman</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received a complaint concerning your acting as a scrutineer for Ian Glachan at the Lavington Public School in the recent New South Wales State Election.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought, `Gosh, what have I done?' The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of this complaint is that you are ineligible to act in this capacity as the Parliament Electorates and Elections Act requires that scrutineers be enrolled within New South Wales. It is noted that you did not claim such enrolment on the appointment form submitted to polling officials at the school and therefore no breach of the Act is involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank goodness for that! The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this matter is brought to your attention to ensure that a similar situation does not arise in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.I. Dickson</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Electoral Commissioner</PARA>
<PARA>I am very grateful to Mr Dickson for telling me that, one, I had been reported&mdash;I did not know anything about that&mdash;and, two, I had been under investigation for the heinous offence of being a scrutineer in another state, when I live three miles away. Fortunately, I am not guilty of any offence, so that is good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But that incident excited me a bit because one of the reasons I became a parliamentarian was that I have a great objection to needless differences in laws between the various states and the Commonwealth. I have been able to unearth a number of `humbug' laws&mdash;as I call them&mdash;where parliaments decide to pass laws that create unnecessary differences and anomalies and thus create problems for law-abiding citizens trying to go about their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did some research to see whether any other parliament in Australia, in this federation, has, in its wisdom, decided that no-one can act as a scrutineer in elections in that particular area, state or territory unless they reside in that particular state or territory. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested to note that there is no other parliament in Australia that requires the scrutineer to be a resident within that particular state. I have gone through them all assiduously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scrutineers Handbook</EMPHASIS>. It is silent. You do not have to be a resident, but you have to be a person over 18 years and, obviously, a person who lives in Australia. I qualify there. In the Tasmanian Electoral Act there is no eligibility requirement as such for scrutineers. You just have to be appointed by the candidate on the appropriate form. In the ACT, not far from here, there is no provision. You can come from anywhere as long as you are appointed. So that is okay. In Western Australia there is no provision for a person to be a scrutineer having to live within the state. My old state parliament, that of Victoria, does not have a provision, and Queensland does not have a provision either. In the Northern Territory there is no provision requiring a person to be a resident of the territory. And so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the New South Wales parliament, in its wisdom, has decided&mdash;and it is the only parliament in Australia to do so&mdash;that a person cannot be a scrutineer if they do not live in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to find out why that is so. Is it a fact that the New South Wales parliament believes that a person on the electoral roll somewhere else in Australia is unfit to be a scrutineer in the state of New South Wales? If that is the case, that is a slight, a whack, to all of us who do not live in New South Wales. Why would that be? Quite frankly, it is a nonsense. It is a stupid provision which has been put in, I would say, without any research or rationale for it. If there is rationale for it, I invite the members of the New South Wales parliament to come out and tell us why it is that a person&mdash;whether they be a member of parliament or not&mdash;who is on the electoral roll of any other place in Australia is not able to be appointed a scrutineer in an election in New South Wales. It is obviously a nonsense. It is a stupid anomaly, and we have got too many of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to talk about my transgressions and to confess to you all about the awful thing that I did across the border in being a scrutineer. How dare I! But I must say I did it innocently and I have been doing it for years. I cannot remember how many times I have been a scrutineer in New South Wales elections, but it is a heck of a lot of times, and I have lived in Victoria for a long while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It looks as though I have been a naughty boy, but I am very glad that Mr Dickson does not think that I have breached the act. I am sorry that members of the Labor Party, in the Albury branch at least, were so upset about it that they had to report me. But never mind. I hope they are not too upset about my raising it today, but I thought it was in the public interest that I do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other areas&mdash;this bill deals with some of them&mdash;in electoral reform of a more serious nature that I think should be talked about and examined. We should take the opportunity now to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one is in connection with people guilty of crimes who are sentenced by courts to prison. There is a very strong feeling in the community that some of those people should not have the privilege of being able to vote. I know that a detailed all-party committee has examined this issue, and I was very happy to hear that the coalition has decided to support an amendment to the act that requires the definition of who is eligible to vote if they are in a prison to be clarified. At present the law does not work, I understand: no-one knows what it means and it is very difficult to enforce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that to actually specify that a person who is sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months or more shall lose the right to vote while in prison is a similar provision to the constitutional provisions dealing with the eligibility of persons to nominate for election to parliament. It conforms. It introduces a common principle, if you like, and I am attracted to that. I ask that the members of the Labor Party give consideration to that proposed amendment because I think it has a lot of merit and it also reflects the concern of many people in the community that people who are guilty of very serious offences and are sentenced to more than 12 months in gaol should not be given the privilege of having a vote. If the sentence is less than 12 months, they are permitted to have that privilege. I think that is a good amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other principle I want to touch on briefly is electoral advertising, especially the need for truth in advertising. We are currently seeing the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Labor Party running a campaign&mdash;paid for by the taxpayer and costing $12 million, I understand&mdash;to promote the government's policy on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that advertising, and certainly in the accompanying statements by the Prime Minister, incorrect claims have been made as to the effect that that Labor Party superannuation policy will have on all Australians. The impression is that, once this magical policy is adopted, everyone in Australia will be entitled to a retirement fund of, in round figures, $450,000-odd, provided they toe the line and agree to the government's levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just not true, because there are very few Australians in the work force at the moment who would get anything like that. In fact, to be eligible for such a long-term benefit, you would have to be in the work force for 40 continuous years, getting paid at an ordinary rate. You would have to take into account inflation and increments as well. So you would have to be a very young person at the time of commencement of the scheme to be eligible for that particular benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are advertisements and accompanying statements currently before us in the community which are being used by the government and which are not true. I believe that the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be reviewed and that there should be provisions made in the electoral act to require all people from all sides of politics, including independent candidates, to be truthful in their advertising&mdash;to be truthful in the way in which they seek the votes and the mandate of Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other classic examples, unfortunately, again illustrating the Prime Minister's lack of regard for candour with the Australian electorate. Before the last election he said he was going to introduce into law, and he spelt it l-a-w, taxation reductions for low income people that would be delivered if he were elected. We all know that he went to great pains to say it was l-a-w&mdash;remember? Of course, after he received the votes of the Australians, very narrowly, he then commenced to abandon that law, l-a-w, and dismantled it. The result is that those taxation reductions were taken away from people, particularly those on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Prime Minister is saying, `Well, look, I'll give you those in the form of a compulsory levy on your wages for superannuation.' So it is a complete turnaround. If he were going to do that, why didn't he say it then, instead of coming forward with this l-a-w promise? The community in Australia demands, and is entitled to, higher performance levels and integrity than that. I think the electoral act should be reviewed to provide for truth in advertising and material statements associated with someone looking for a vote to be elected to the parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) responds to the report to the parliament by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related thereto</EMPHASIS>. This report was tabled in the House in November last year. I am a member of the joint standing committee and a signatory to the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address a number of substantial matters, in addition to some technical matters, contained in the bill. I support the bill and the amendment which the government will be moving. The presence of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has been an innovation of the parliament under this government. The joint standing committee has reported on every federal election since 1984. It plays an important part in the process of electoral reform and ensures that the policy and administrative procedures which apply to the community's entitlement to vote and the various obligations attached to that are as up to date and sensible as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the joint committee by the government reflects the fact&mdash;if the truth be told in this parliament and in the various state parliaments&mdash;that it is only the Labor Party that has really been interested in electoral reform; it is only the Labor Party that has been interested in ensuring that people who are qualified to vote are able to vote and are assisted in that process. A number of technical measures contained in the bill before the House continue that fine tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with some of the technical matters contained in this bill. As is the case with electoral and referendum matters, in very many respects the devil is in the detail. While in general policy terms we can often very easily and quickly come to a correct policy view, it is important to make sure that that view is implemented properly and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill implements a range of measures. This is the second bill that provides for measures contained in the committee's report on the 1993 federal election. Many of the measures suggested by the committee have been taken up in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1), which was introduced into this House earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first important provision in this bill allows for greater flexibility in the method used by the Australian Electoral Commission for the conduct of electoral roll reviews. This is an important process because it ensures that the roll, which is as up to date as it can be, reflects those people in particular electorates who are eligible to vote. Currently, full roll reviews are conducted every two years. Those so-called habitation reviews, as members would be aware, are conducted by the local Australian Electoral Commission returning officer in each district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Electoral Commission, in part of its submission to the joint committee, made the point that those current arrangements are inflexible and do not allow for the targeting of high turnover areas, high growth rates or areas of known under-enrolment. The amendments contained in this bill will have the effect of providing greater flexibility, therefore enabling the AEC to much more productively, flexibly and sensibly ensure that the state of the roll will, as best it can, reflect those people in our Australian community who are eligible to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will enable the reviews to be undertaken in a continuous way and will enable sensible targeting of the high population growth areas, high turnover areas and areas of known under-enrolment. That first important provision will have a very beneficial effect on the operation of the commission and the allocation of its resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second technical measure in the bill will make it easier for registered electors who are travelling overseas to apply to become eligible overseas voters. The effect of the bill is to extend the timetable from one month of their expected departure to within three months of their expected departure or within one year after their actual date of departure. This provides, sensibly, for greater flexibility in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third technical measure in the bill will extend the time for close of rolls from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. on the day that the rolls close for an election. As members would be only too familiar with, on the day of the close of the rolls there is frenetic activity, as there is with any timetable that is established, to ensure that people are able to exercise their entitlement to vote. The sensible extension of the close of the rolls from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. will enable people who are working on that day to have a couple of hours after work to get to a local AEC office or, in my case, to the central AEC office in Perth to get on the roll to be able to vote three or four weeks down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth technical measure in this bill will allow for the dispatch of postal ballot materials to all registered general postal voters immediately after the declaration of nominations. This was an area that was the subject of some discussion in the committee but, after some deliberation, on balance the committee noted that currently only those general postal voters who are registered as unable to sign their names are sent postal ballot material directly, and came to the view that it would be appropriate to send that material to all registered general postal voters immediately on the declaration of nominations. I think that will have a positive effect, particularly in remote areas where postal services are sometimes infrequent and unreliable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final technical measure dealt with in the bill relates to the right of prisoners to enrol and vote. The previous speaker, the member for Indi, as I understood him, indicated his happiness with the government's amendment to the measure in the bill. The minister outlined the reasons for proposing the amendment in his speech earlier. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in doing so the government proposes introducing an amendment to the bill which will make workable the administration of the existing provisions regarding prisoner disqualification. The existing provisions provide for disqualification based on the maximum sentence which could have been imposed. The amendment the government proposes will provide that the disqualification be based on the actual sentence imposed.</PARA>
<PARA>That certainly picks up the spirit of the recommendation of the joint standing committee and is an appropriate implementation of the sentiment expressed in the committee's report. There are a number of other technical measures contained in the bill, all of which, in my view, make it fairer, easier and more sensible&mdash;fairer and easier for people to cast a valid vote and easier and more sensible for the AEC in its implementation and oversight of the Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are, in my view, the main provisions of a technical nature in the bill. The bill ensures that the notion of the soundness of our electoral system and the significance of electoral reform are placed before the House. There are two matters of substance not the subject of this bill but the subject of soundness of our electoral system and electoral reform generally which I would like to spend a bit of time referring to. One goes to the very basis of the nature of parliamentary democracy in Australia&mdash;that is, the basis of our electoral systems for state and federal parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives is based on the notion of one vote, one value. All the electoral divisions or districts in the House of Representatives are equal in numbers as near as practicable within a 10 per cent plus or minus deviation of equal votes. On current enrolment figures, that means that every member of the House of Representatives currently represents, by way of rule of thumb, somewhere between 72,000 and 75,000 enrolled voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably and unfortunately, this same sound principle of parliamentary democracy is not applied in all our state parliaments. I have previously made the point in this place that the Western Australian state parliament is based on a massively unfair malapportionment for both the Legislative Assembly, the lower house, and the Legislative Council, the upper house. The effect of the malapportionment in Western Australia is that there are vast differences in the numbers of enrolled voters that members of the Legislative Assembly represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Western Australian Electoral Act, the current state parliament is composed of 57 members of the Legislative Assembly&mdash;34 members in a designated metropolitan area and 23 members in a designated non-metropolitan area. The average enrolment for those metropolitan members is currently in the order of 23,000 and the current average enrolment for those in non-metropolitan areas is in the order of 12,000. You can see the massive malapportionment, the massive unfairness, the massive attack on the principle of parliamentary democracy and the principle of one vote, one value that the Western Australian parliament currently is an example of. In the metropolitan area, there are 34 seats at 23,000 in each seat and in a designated non-metropolitan area there are 23 seats with an average of 12,000 enrolled voters in each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state of the Western Australian parliament is a direct result of the fact that the Legislative Council in Western Australia has, since its inception, been dominated in a political and numerical sense by the conservative parties, in their modern day guise the Liberal and National parties. On every occasion the Labor Party has put into the parliament of Western Australia measures to enshrine the principle of one vote, one value those measures have been rebuffed, rejected and defeated by the conservative dominated Legislative Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days in Western Australia we have seen a report by the Commission on Government, established by the current state government, the Court government, after much dragging of feet and urging by others. Nonetheless, it was established by the Court government as one of the recommendations arising out of the WA Inc. royal commission. The Commission on Government reported last week. Recommendation 42, in chapter eight, its chapter on the Legislative Assembly, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present metropolitan and non-metropolitan zones for the Legislative Assembly should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quota of enrolled voters for each Legislative Assembly electoral district should be determined by dividing the total State enrolment, projected four years in advance, by the number of seats to be distributed. A plus or minus 15 per cent deviation from the quota should be permitted based on the criteria listed below.</PARA>
<PARA>Fifteen per cent plus or minus is not the same standard this House is configured on, but is, nonetheless, a massive and substantial improvement on the malapportionment I previously referred to. In the course of its commentary on that recommendation, the Commission on Government had this to say on page 274 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe there is a strong link between the prevention of corrupt, illegal and improper behaviour in the public sector and the electoral system. This view was supported by public submissions to the Commission from across the political spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA>At the heart of the Commission on Government's recommendation is that there is a direct link to be drawn between the soundness and fairness of a state's or a parliament's electoral system and the standing in which that state parliament and, as a logical consequence, that state government has in the community. Again, the report states `a strong link between the prevention of corrupt, illegal and improper behaviour in the public sector and the electoral system'. When one looks at some of the commentary in the chapter I have referred to, the Commission on Government makes the following point in respect of the malapportionment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the legislation divides the State in 34 metropolitan electoral districts and 23 non-metropolitan electoral districts. There is no explanation as to why such a distribution should be made nor any logic underpinning such a division. The arbitrary division of districts creates anomalies within and between metropolitan and non-metropolitan zones. The legislation provides that the number of voters in each electoral district can vary by plus or minus 15 per cent from the quota as a result of factors specified in the legislation. These include considerations of community of interest, means of communication and distance from the capital, physical features, existing boundaries . . . and the trend of demographic change.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These legislative restrictions on the drawing of boundaries result in a pattern of electoral districts which has little justification. For example, genuinely remote electoral districts, such as Kimberley and Eyre, have approximately the same number of electors as electoral districts on the coastal strip near Perth such as Mandurah and Bunbury. The seats of Merredin, Moore and Greenough are geographically large with dispersed population centres and are less easy for a member to service than the seats of Geraldton or Albany. The comparison between metropolitan and non-metropolitan seats also provides illogical allocations of electors to districts. Mandurah has half the number of electors as the neighbouring seat of Rockingham.</PARA>
<PARA>It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Weighting in Western Australia is controlled by legislative prescription which is unfair and results in electoral districts with boundaries which have little justification. The major defect in existing legislation is to make any seat outside of the metropolitan area half the enrolment of a metropolitan seat.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a damning indictment by the Commission on Government of the current Western Australian parliamentary system. As a consequence, it is very distressing and disappointing to see the Leader of the National Party in Western Australian, the current Deputy Premier, Hendy Cowan, reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> thumbing his nose at the commission's report. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deputy Premier Hendy Cowan says he is still unwilling to accept changes to WA's electoral system but a model which allowed electoral quotas to deviate by about 25 per cent might be more palatable to him.</PARA>
<PARA>He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cowan said the COG's recommendation of a deviation of 15 per cent was inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"They (the COG) have effectively modified the system we've got, so it can't be all bad," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I'd say plus or minus 50 per cent is just right but somewhere between the two is a compromise.</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Premier's formal position is that he believes there should be a 50 per cent differentiation plus or minus in the electoral districts. What he is saying effectively is: no change from the current system&mdash;a current system which is damningly indicted by the Commission on Government, and which was established by the Court government. I was pleased to see the parliamentary leader of the Western Australian Labor Party, Jim McGinty, quoted as saying that he thought the 15 per cent tolerance suggested by the Commission on Government was probably excessive:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it's so enormously better than what we've got that we'd be prepared to accept that.</PARA>
<PARA>The final point that the article makes is that most of the other states had a deviation of 10 per cent&mdash;which, of course, is the Commonwealth model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members might be aware that Jim McGinty currently has an action before the High Court challenging the Western Australian electoral system. That matter is due to be heard in September of this year; that is, next month. It would be sensible for the Western Australian state government and the Premier, Richard Court, to indicate immediately that they will be legislating to implement the recommendation of the Commission on Government so far as the electoral system is concerned so as to save the taxpayer of Western Australian the cost and expense of a defended action before the High Court which is due to commence very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue of substance I would like to refer to is compulsory voting. Just in passing, I was pleased to see that the Commission on Government in its report recommended that the present system of compulsory voting in Western Australia be retained. An analysis in the report at pages 313 to 317 makes the point that compulsory voting has a clear and positive role to play. It then quotes a member of the upper house in Western Australia, the Hon. John Cowdell MLC, in a submission to the commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With compulsory voting the Australian political system has developed a balance and stability. Voluntary voting will almost invariably distort the system. It will increase the likelihood of financial corruption, while presenting the potential for undue minority influence, and neglect and alienation of the have nots.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no doubt that compulsory voting has an educative role and contributes in this way to our civic culture.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 because it covers such a lot of activity that is very pertinent to each one of us, and yet we seldom have the opportunity to debate it in the chamber. It comes right on the heels of our just emerging from the rigours of a state campaign in Queensland. Whatever else we might say in connection with the deficiencies of the act, I believe that the Australian Electoral Commission does have a fine record in providing the groundwork for fair and democratic elections in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I say that, I believe the commission should place itself on contract to the states to run their elections. We already have joint roles. I believe that if we had the sophistication and the accuracy of the Australian Electoral Commission's operations in the states we would have overcome some of the major problems that we saw in the recent Queensland election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of what happens. There is no specialised team within the Electoral Commission in Queensland. As a result, when it comes to an election contracts are taken out for people to provide for those elections. We had an incident where a couple had a state election run from underneath their house. Halfway through the counting, the hot water system gave out and a flood of water covered the bottom floor. Counting was suspended until the hot water system was fixed. That is not good enough. People in the Electoral Commission are not trained for the full three years and are not equipped to deal with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the voting count, I understand that you cannot declare a vote until the last vote is in. If the checking of available votes were done more speedily, a position would emerge a lot faster than occurs at present. As a result of this type of delay, state seats that were not regarded as marginal became marginal towards the end of the 10 days, and a lot of emphasis has been put on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government&mdash;I agree with a member of the Labor Party who made this suggestion at the time&mdash;should contract out the services of the commission to the states, particularly Queensland. We already do it with the joint role, and that is the way we should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should also look at the fairness of a distribution system. It is a known fact now that the elections are over in Queensland that the conservatives had 53.4 per cent of the two-party preferred vote&mdash;yet it is still in opposition&mdash;as against the Labor vote of 46.6 per cent. We have seen that happen in this House also. So distributions&mdash;electoral boundaries&mdash;should be a very important feature of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major emphasis in this bill&mdash;I will not discuss all the issues; I will take selected ones&mdash;is prisoner voting. I believe it is ludicrous to suggest that a prisoner of the crown is allowed to vote if their sentence is no longer than five years. I understand that our own constitution provides that we cannot become parliamentarians if we have had a conviction lodged against us for more than 12 months. I do not see why that should not be the case for prisoner voting. Excluding from voting a person with a sentence of five years or more is not really the way we should be treating our prisoners. There has been talk of the close of rolls at 8 p.m. I see no problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an instance of the necessity to do something about our postal voting. Areas within the electorate of Dawson have only weekly mail runs. By the time the nominations are closed and the first notice is out for applications for postal votes, often that coincides with the mail run. You can only react to it by getting the vote back on the same mail run. That cannot happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A postal vote arrives through the once-weekly mail. People have to hang on to it for a week. It goes back that second week. It has to be posted out in the third week and, when it gets there, there is no chance of it being returned within the time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ensuring that postal votes go out immediately, and that they go out immediately without the applications, and having a roster form, would be a big improvement and would allow people to have votes that otherwise would be denied them. I see that as a major improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters that I want to talk about that have not been mentioned in the bill. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) mentioned compulsory voting. I agree with him. I was in the United States for the mid-term elections last year. The new government was voted on by 38 per cent of Americans eligible to vote at the time&mdash;that is, only 38 per cent returned a vote. So we saw a massive changeover in government structure on the basis of only 38 per cent voting. I believe that a situation of non-compulsory voting lends itself to a lot more abuse, either financially or by the soliciting of votes, than a compulsory system, as ours is. I offer that as a personal view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to talk about the redistribution. About 12 months ago the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) came in here complaining about the efforts of the Queensland Electoral Commissioner determining the boundaries in the last election. It is a problem in the act itself. There are such narrow tolerances that it means that a state which is growing, such as Queensland, will have a redistribution every election. In fact, we have had that for the last two periods. I believe there should be some degree of tolerance, either by increasing that margin of growth or, where a state is entitled on the basis of its record to a percentage of an extra seat, that should be counted as an extra seat within that state so the redistribution can take place once every three elections instead of every election as is happening at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to talk about the comments of the honourable member for Perth and the tolerances themselves. I want to put the view not of a political party and not of a politician, but of the person in a rural seat out of contact and out of the notice to a large extent of the politician. They do not have the same chance of representation from their member as does a person in an inner city suburb within an electorate in Brisbane, for instance. I say quite categorically that a person in Brisbane can make a local telephone call, either to the member or to a Commonwealth department, and get their problem solved relatively easily. I give the example of a place in the electorate of Dawson that is right at the end of a telephone line, probably 100 kilometres from the nearest centre that I would visit once a month. Those people do not have the same chance of representation as people in a Sydney or Brisbane seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no trouble saying that there should be a 10 per cent or 20 per cent tolerance on the basis of population in areas of greater size than others. We should take the seat of Kalgoorlie, which covers 2 million square kilometres. Can anybody tell me that someone who has a problem in the electorate of Kalgoorlie has the same access to representation from their member in Kalgoorlie as someone in Perth? It is an absolute myth. I say that not because I am a politician and because we have 24 hours in the day to work and represent, but because the people out there are not getting proper representation. Perhaps we should look at the Queensland system that put a ceiling on the size of the electorate to ensure that the number of voting constituents was not as large in a smaller electorate. I think it is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Moreton had a complaint, it was a complaint about the system, not against the redistribution commissioner, who has a whole list of qualifications and conditions that he has to look at before he makes that redistribution. I believe that the people who do the redistribution have done a great job in Queensland. The only thing is that I do not believe they should be redistributing as frequently as they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last matter is truth in political advertising. It is paramount that we have a look at this and the terms of the act. Those of you who are familiar with the act would know that it says&mdash;I think it is section 329&mdash;something about truth in political advertising from the point of view of media and television presentation but it does not include reference to a verbal statement. It is too loose at the moment. This was identified in the last election, when Alasdair Webster tried to get some justification because of the lack of truth in the whole campaign. Justice Gaudron said that she could not do anything about that decision because of the way the act was run, that it was not within her competence to give a judgment and that the law did not effectively cover the points that were raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is about truth in political advertising. It is about whether or not politicians are to be trusted. A big difference I have seen in the 20 years I have represented this place is the manner in which politicians are viewed. Compared with 20 years ago, they now do not expect to be trusted and people do not expect them to tell the truth. I think that is an indictment of the whole system. If a person made misleading comments in commercial advertising, they would be hauled up before the Trade Practices Commission and they would be fined for that lapse. But today we see promises and assertions made. They were made in my electorate during the last election&mdash;quite deliberately. It was alleged that the policies we were putting up at that time indicated that we were going to close this office and that office, which was never our intention. It is a sad indictment that when you go to an election with comprehensive, open policies, as we</PARA>
<PARA>did in 1993, they can form the basis on which you can be defeated. I think that is a reflection on the act and the manner in which we run federal campaigns throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very strongly about this last point because I believe it is bringing into disrepute this parliament and the people who serve here. We need to implement some measure which ensures that people have to be truthful in their political advertising and do not stoop to a lower standard&mdash;in fact, it is almost a nil standard. In the last Queensland election a deliberate lie was told in connection with the hospitals. The Labor Party asserted that we were going to close hospitals&mdash;on the basis of a maiden speech made by the Leader of the Liberal Party in that state. That was absolute nonsense, yet the Labor Party persevered with it. When an injunction was sought to make sure that that could not be put to air, the injunction could not succeed because of the loose way in which the act was written. It appears that the courts expect politicians to tell lies and not the truth at elections. That is a sad reflection on this parliament and politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that a person who is imprisoned with a sentence of one year or more should be treated exactly the same way as we as parliamentarians seeking office in this place are treated, that postal voting has to be improved to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to vote and that political advertising should conform with the standards required by the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which makes a number of minor amendments to the Electoral Act. I would like to talk firstly about a number of those amendments and then pick up on a couple of the issues that have been part of the debate so far today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first amendments relates to role reviews. Currently, roll reviews are conducted every two years. However, there is not a lot of flexibility under the current legislation with respect to the nature of an enrolment review and what is required; that is, essentially electorates have areas of high voter turnover or high growth areas. In my current electorate of Corinella there is a large growth corridor in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Essentially, it is an area that needs to be continually assessed with respect to enrolment requirements. Other parts of my electorate have significant numbers of flats and tend to have a more transient population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also find, when you look at electoral figures within divisions, that there are areas which historically have significant levels of under-enrolment. This amendment is designed to target those areas to try to ensure that we have an even more accurate electoral roll than we currently have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eligibility of overseas electors relates to a change. In case an election occurs, voters going overseas have to apply to be registered overseas electors within a set time prior to their departure. Currently, they must apply within one month prior to departure. The amendment allows for the application within three months prior to departure or 12 months after the date of departure. So, again, it will increase the flexibility of this system to take into account people's circumstances and therefore should ensure a higher turnout and more integrity in the electoral result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the rolls close at 6 p.m on the final day. This is a difficulty for many electors. Circumstances can be that rolls close quite soon after the date of an election has been announced. The day people realise they are not enrolled at the correct location or have not enrolled at all can well be the day in question and often getting to an AEC office after work is extremely difficult. This amendment increases that time from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., which will assist those people to get on the roll and to exercise their democratic duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is doubt under the law at the moment as to whether an enrolment application received by fax is a legal enrolment. This amendment specifically provides that enrolment applications can be received by fax. That will particularly assist people in remote areas. Where mail services are difficult, it will give people a chance to make sure that they are on the roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several nominations which relate to the issue of bulk nominations. Political parties may nominate a number of candidates for a range of seats in one bulk nomination. Currently, if bulk nomination deposits are refunded they must be paid to the candidate, regardless of who paid them, which is usually the political party's branch organisation. This amendment will provide that the deposit is refunded to the person who paid it, unless authorised otherwise. That will simplify refunding arrangements for political party branches and the AEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another technicality which has come to light is when someone who is part of a bulk nomination list dies before an election occurs. I guess we had a variation of this with respect to an independent candidate who passed away in the seat of Dickson after nominations closed but prior to the election occurring, which led to a special re-election for the seat of Dickson some time after the March 1993 general election. There was doubt about whether someone in those circumstances would invalidate the other candidates in the bulk nomination. This amendment clears the way for that not to be the case and ensures that we will not have large-scale electoral mayhem if those circumstances occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two amendments regarding general postal voters. The first amendment will allow those people who are caring for a seriously ill or infirmed person and who are unable to attend a polling place because of their caring duties to apply to be a general postal voter. It will essentially assist those people caring for a person in a private capacity and where it is not possible for them to leave the patient alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment will allow postal ballot papers and postal vote certificates to be sent to all registered general postal voters without them first having to complete an application for a postal vote. Currently only those general postal voters who are unable to sign their name are sent material directly. All other general postal voters are sent an application for a postal vote. This process serves only to delay the turnaround of the postal votes and can and has caused sufficient delays such that the votes are not received in time to be counted. This amendment will particularly assist voters in remote areas where mail deliveries are infrequent or unreliable. The need to correct that issue has been raised with me by local electoral office officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter I want to raise is the hours of pre-poll voting. Currently, if I am a Victorian and am in Western Australia on polling day, I have only until the close of the ballot in my own state to cast my vote. Depending on the time of year, when it is 6 p.m. in Victoria it may be only 4 p.m. in Western Australia. If I turned up at five past four to seek a pre-poll vote in Western Australia, I would be denied under the current law because the ballot would have closed where I would normally have cast a ballot. That is obviously quite absurd and very unfair. This amendment will alter that so that voting will be from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. for all voters regardless of where they are voting and where they are from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take up a couple of issues that were referred to earlier in the debate and were part of the discussion and consideration of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters with respect to the conduct of the 1993 election. There are two issues I would like to look at in particular. One is the allegations of enrolment and voting fraud. The second is compulsory voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After every election there are allegations of voting fraud. In reality, results are changed because of large scale voting fraud in particular areas. After the 1993 election this issue received quite a run in the media. Alan Jones and another radio personality from Sydney, whose name escapes me, were quite hot on the issue, and it received some coverage in the written media. It was also part of the basis of a challenge to the result in the seat of Macquarie launched by supporters of the defeated Liberal candidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allegedly, people are running around, voting at different booths, under different names sometimes and under the same names on other occasions. That is creating a result which is not accurate. A range of issues were raised with respect to that, and I will quote from the report of the committee in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the restrictions which have been mooted on this issue were seen as being quite draconian and affecting the basic principle of our current electoral system&mdash;accessibility. Although you can never stop people committing fraud in small cases, you have to balance accessibility for voters with the abuses that may occur. It is a question we face with respect to most systems the government implements, be it unemployment benefits, social security or taxation. It goes right down the line. They are the sorts of issues you face when you look at a particular system, putting it in place and making it work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report raised some of the issues involved. There is proof of identity at enrolment by requiring the production of a driver's licence, passport, et cetera, which would particularly disadvantage those in remote and isolated regions and those from Aboriginal communities. There is proof of identity at voting, which would have similar problems. The use of a voter identity card is an issue which could be equated with the Australia Card, which was overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people when it was debated some years ago. Furthermore, identity cards in themselves could be open to abuse and thereby actually reinforce what they are trying to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are identification checks as used by banks, which have proved to be inordinately expensive from the banking point of view and would certainly be very difficult to implement with something as massive as the electoral system. In the report, the AEC was quoted in respect of these measures and got to the nub of the argument about why they should not be supported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some of the measures discussed [would] tend disproportionately to affect underprivileged or marginal members of society. The burden of inconvenience on voters could well serve to reduce the high level of voluntary compliance with compulsory enrolment and voting which has largely been forthcoming in Australia. Both of these factors would tend to diminish rather than enhance the legitimacy of Australian election processes.</PARA>
<PARA>The AEC certainly produced some evidence of incidents of multiple voting before the committee. By multiple voting, I mean that the same name is marked off more than once in the lists that are kept by the divisional returning officers and at the polling booths. This situation is discovered when an electorate's lists come back from the polling booths and are consolidated. Again, I look to the report of the commission on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Australian Electoral Commission post-election does a very exhaustive review of what has occurred at the election with respect to the machinery and conduct of the election. The AEC looks at these sorts of issues because it has charge of the elections and is very concerned to ensure that the integrity of the elections is beyond question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the last election in 1993, all the rolls were scanned and notes were taken of when the same name was marked off more than once. Those details were collated and investigations took place to see what in fact had occurred. Letters were initially sent out. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 14 172 such letters sent out in 1993. Of the replies, 7173 revealed cases where the name of an apparent non-voter could be matched with the similar name of an apparent multiple voter; that is, there had been a polling official error whereby the wrong name had been marked off against the certified list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 535 cases where the elector admitted voting more than once. Of these cases, 443 were explained by circumstances known to the AEC, such as age, infirmity and language difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>What can happen is that elderly people may shoot down to vote in the morning because they believe they are doing the right thing and they see it as an important part of their democratic right. They then come home and, in the afternoon, the family comes around and asks, `Have you gone down to vote yet?' and the elderly people forget sometimes. We are talking about a total of 443 cases across Australia and that is not very many. People with language difficulties may also have problems. They may misunderstand the circumstances as to when they are supposed to vote, what they are supposed to do when they vote and how many times they are supposed to vote. Essentially, that was the nature of the majority of those cases. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 92 cases of admitted multiple voting were referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at the end of September 1993, there were 695 cases where the letters seeking information were either returned undelivered (281) or were not answered (414). No further investigations were undertaken in respect to those returned undelivered, although the AEC did commence objection action to remove those names from the rolls. Of the 414 cases where the letter had not been answered, 318 had no further action taken. These were cases where the age of the elector, or other circumstances known to the AEC, were such that it was determined that further action was not warranted. The remaining 96 cases were referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the total of 188 cases referred to the Australian Federal Police, as at October 1993 15 have been dealt with and one of these has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The AEC generally accepts the advice of the Australian Federal Police as to whether to proceed with prosecution action.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of greatest concern was the further figure of 5769 replies where evidence was "inconclusive"; that is, there was no conclusive evidence of polling official error to explain a multiple mark, but as the voter in question denied voting more than once no further action was taken. In 52 of these cases, three or more marks were recorded against a name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC advised the Inquiry that there is no particular pattern evident across Divisions, and even making the unlikely assumption that all 5769 were cases of multiple voting, the figures can be broken down to show that in no Division could the result have been affected.</PARA>
<PARA>If the situation is that, after all those processes, the result of an electorate has been decided by a margin which is less than the number of cases of potential multiple voting, the AEC and candidates have the right to petition the Court of Disputed Returns in accordance with section 357 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. There have been occasions when this action has been taken, but there has never been a case proven that multiple voting significantly affected the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, with respect to the last election, that was not the case. The evidence stated quite clearly that there were no incidences where electorates were affected by multiple voting. When you are talking about a situation where more than 11 million people voted at the 1993 election, you can see that the figures I quoted are only a minor part of the overall voting population. Again, this is in a diffuse manner, right across a range of electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue raised was what is called cemetery voting, which is something that used to be fairly rampant some years ago in my home state of Victoria, particularly in relation to the Richmond City Council. Thankfully, that is not an issue these days. It relates to people apparently having voted after they have died. The commission makes detailed inquiries on this issue. Through marking its lists, it details what has actually occurred. Lists of state births, deaths and marriages from bureaucracies and state governments, and death notices, are all collated and used to look at what has happened with deceased electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993 federal election all but 18 of such multiple marks were conclusively proved to be an error in marking the certified list or to relate to an elector who had died after the date of casting his or her vote. In other words, sometimes there were polling official errors and sometimes someone may have died but they died post the event so had very probably cast their vote. We are talking about a minor number&mdash;18 across all divisions of Australia. There are over 140 divisions in Australia, so it is not very much at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass on to another issue&mdash;compulsory voting. This was the object of some debate during the hearings of the committee and has been the object of some debate subsequently, with Senator Minchin, in particular, in the other place, raising the rally cry for the abolition of compulsory voting. Compulsory voting has been in place in the electoral system in Australia since 1924. Essentially, over the last 70 years it has not been the subject of contention between the major political parties. There has been pretty much bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obligation on voters is not that they must in fact vote but that they must attend the voting booth and have their name struck off. The argument that people are being forced to vote is incorrect. They can&mdash;and some do&mdash;take the opportunity to leave the ballot paper blank or to put on names such as Bruce Springsteen, depending on which tour is on. I think I saw `The Rolling Stones' put down once and a couple of times I have seen the names of defeated ALP candidates written on the ballot papers. But all to no avail. The fact is that people are required to attend and be marked off, but no more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very important reasons why compulsory voting is in place and why it is a significant improvement, I believe, on some of the systems overseas. The member for Lilley (Mr Swan) mentioned that in non-compulsory voting the turnout is significantly lower than in compulsory voting. In some cases 30 to 40 per cent of eligible voters will actually cast a vote. That means pressure is put on political parties, and the debate is often skewed not towards getting out everybody who is going to vote anyway but on concentrating on those who will be sought out to vote, who will go out to vote because they have a particular reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen that in America, with the New Right, with respect to the religious lunatic fringe and the National Rifle Association. You get skewed results and you get a situation where politicians can be effectively almost owned by a constituency because that constituency gets behind them or, if they do not do what they say, gets out from behind them. Those circumstances are well worth avoiding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly under the current system we do not have that sort of problem. We are allowed to concentrate more on the issues. People make that choice. If they make a choice not to vote, they can attend the polling booth and they can have their name struck off and avoid that onerous task. Thankfully, we are talking about over 90 per cent of people voting in this country. It has broad support. Everyone grumbles but at the same time they still do the right thing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to join in the debate this afternoon on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. As previous speakers have indicated, the bill contains a number of amendments not only to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 but also to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 which arise from the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in the report of its inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related thereto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the bill before the House seeks to implement a number of the recommendations of the committee. The coalition has considered the bill, and in a large number of cases we support the changes that the government is proposing. There are, however, a number of areas where we either believe that the government does not go far enough or disagree with what the government is seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is incumbent on all of us as members of parliament to try to make sure that the electoral laws of Australia are such that the result of a federal election accurately represents the will of the Australian people as cast on polling day. Over the years there have been great concerns that on a number of occasions the results of elections, as declared, have meant that the will of the people has not been properly represented in that the wrong government has been declared to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We disagree in particular with four major aspects of this bill. Earlier speakers for the coalition have indicated that we are opposed to what the government is suggesting should occur with respect to prisoner voting. I refer to the 1994 platform resolutions and rules of the ALP. Rule 37 states that Labor supports electoral laws to provide for all prisoners to have the right to enrol and vote. `All prisoners should have the right to enrol and vote.' That is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, that was the announced intention of the government in this legislation&mdash;that all prisoners would have the right to enrol and vote. But, given community outcry, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) announced that the government was not going to proceed with that amendment. We now find that the government is proposing an amendment which would permit people who are sentenced to terms of imprisonment of not more than five years to remain on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's original proposal was greeted with absolute outrage from all sections of the Australian community. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 9 July 1995 indicated that the government in this matter, as in so many other matters, is totally out of touch. The government finally recognised that the position it was taking was totally unacceptable. Of course the government has backed down, yet in our view it has not backed down sufficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a very strong argument which could be made out that people who are incarcerated for breaking the laws of this nation ought not to be able to vote at all while they are in prison. However, the coalition has come to the collective conclusion that those people who are in prison for not more than 12 months should be able to vote and that those people who are in gaol for more than 12 months ought not to be able to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Australian community is sick and tired of the weak, gutless, spineless approach by Labor governments to law and order. The fact that the government is seeking to have on the electoral roll prisoners who are in gaol for not more than five years indicates that the government is soft in this area. The government is, again, not representative of the will of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have concerns in the area of general postal voting. We are going to move amendments to the bill before the House to ensure that the government's changes, while they are an improvement, can be more effective. We would prefer to see the law require the divisional returning officer to dispatch the ballot papers as soon as they are received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area we have a major concern about is canvassing. The provisions in the legislation seek to prohibit canvassing within six metres of a divisional returning office or a pre-poll voting office. Many of the returning officers for the electorates throughout Australia are now situated in shopping centres, and I do not believe that it is practical to prohibit any sort of canvassing within six metres of the entrance of those polling booths. If you force people to go beyond six metres from the entrance of a shop occupied by the returning officer, then you will have people in front of other shops. We believe that the six-metre rule should be changed in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about the government's proposal to permit a preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes on the Monday prior to polling day. As we all know, the Labor Party drags out union officials prior to elections. They seem to have an enormous number of such people who are able to assist them prior to elections and, of course, other parties do not necessarily have that number of volunteers on the ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it the case that the July current account deficit of $2.1 billion, whilst below the Australian record of May&mdash;now revised up to $3 billion&mdash;is far too high? Do you agree with the former deputy Reserve Bank governor, John Phillips, who said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS>, `The figures below the peak are going to be much too high?' Given that Australia is the only OECD country that has failed to get its current account deficit lower than three per cent since 1983, given that you have presided over three current deficit account blow-outs in 12 years and given that over the last three months you have presided over the two highest deficits ever, aren't the Australian people entitled to feel a deep sense of uncertainty about your economic management?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question because it is appropriate, I think, to note today's current account figures which show, as he said, that the outcome for this month was $2.1 billion&mdash;a reduction of $1 billion in the last two months. As we all know, these figures do bounce around from month to month, but that is the reality: it has come down a long way in the last two months. Importantly, in terms of the trend, the statistician notes on the front page of the release that `this is the first decrease in the monthly trend estimate of the current account deficit since December 1993'. So at least we are seeing the trend start to turn down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ruddock" NAMEID="0J4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you sure it is a trend?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the statistician's calculation of the trend. That is a welcome development. It is also worth noting that, in original terms, exports rose $559 million, or 10 per cent, to $6,244 million&mdash;the highest monthly level recorded to date, as the statistician noted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, these are good outcomes in terms of the pattern of improvement, with exports increasing on a seasonally adjusted basis by nine per cent and imports by one per cent. In respect of exports, that is a turnaround on a period of flatness that we had in the previous three months and hopefully augurs well for a better export performance in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is certainly what we expect. As I have mentioned previously, the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects that commodity exports will be far stronger in 1995-96 than in 1994-95&mdash;growth of $6.5 billion compared with a growth of $1.2 billion in 1994-95. For our commodity exports we expect a major turnaround through the substantial breaking of the drought&mdash;I know it has not broken in every part of the country&mdash;improvements in commodity prices and, hopefully, some further pick up in the world economy, helping that in terms of volumes and prices. On the export side, that is a very welcome likely development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the import side, the spectacular growth of imports in 1994-95 of some 16 per cent is highly unlikely to be replicated, with the likelihood being that import growth will slow with some slower growth of the economy and investment, meaning that our forecast for import growth this year is down from 16 per cent last year to eight per cent this year. We are looking at a quite different pattern for both exports and imports&mdash;much stronger exports, weaker growth of imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that the balance of trade will be greatly improved. Certainly, today's figures are an encouraging start for that. It is also true that the higher level of world interest rates will continue to feed through to some extent into the net income deficit. That means that the gains made this year on the total current account deficit will be notable but not spectacular, but things should be moving in the right direction. The budget forecast of a reduction in the current account deficit of half a per cent of GDP should certainly be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the current account being a constraint on growth, I do not accept that this is a constraint on us producing substantial outcomes in terms of growth of the economy and employment and further reductions in unemployment. It is the budget forecast that we will get growth of some 3 3/4 per cent, that employment will grow by nearly three per cent and that the unemployment rate will continue to fall. That can be managed in the context of bringing the current account down so that the current account outcomes are not going to be a constraint on us producing good economic outcomes in 1995-96. We have had four years of growth consecutively to this stage with tomorrow's national accounts figures almost certain to show that we will equal the record for quarterly accounts&mdash;that is, for quarterly growth, 16 quarters. We would expect to go well past that record in the course of 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, therefore, not five minutes of economic sunshine; we have had four years of growth with the last three years being substantial economic growth&mdash;growth of over four per cent in the last two years and growth in 1995-96 likely to be around near four per cent. It is just ridiculous in the extreme to describe such outcomes as five minutes of economic sunshine. Of course, when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer he could not chalk up results remotely in this area of achievement. The balance of payment figures today are welcome. We believe they are an encouraging start to this year.</PARA>

There are half a dozen countries in the OECD, Western industrial countries, which have foreign debt as a higher percentage of GDP than Australia&mdash;and that includes Canada and New Zealand, two highly comparable countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to digital radio, I can make it clear that the government is very keen to make sure that Australia is a leader, not a follower, in the introduction of new communications technology&mdash;in particular, the introduction of digital radio. Last Friday at the FARB convention I outlined the government's strategy with the introduction of digital radio. It is our belief that digital radio is the future of radio in Australia. It will deliver several things: firstly, there will be more radio stations offering a greater diversity for listeners; secondly, it has the capacity to deliver CD quality sound using digital radio; and, thirdly, it has the ability to deliver data as well as sound. Someone living in Woonona and thinking of travelling up to Sydney might be interested to hear the traffic reports on the freeway. They can call up from their digital radio the latest traffic reports, which will be delivered to their radio using wireless technology. They will be able to get radio traffic reports on demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be able to make EFTPOS transactions. I know that the honourable member for Throsby is very keen on Australian music and rock concerts. If he hears a concert advertised on the radio, he might be able to push a button on his radio and purchase a ticket to go and see that concert. In this way, the arrival of digital radio allows all sorts of new transactions to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's strategy involves the commencement of certain experimental transmissions by January next year. I have decided that these experimental transmissions will take place in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The government is prepared to fund the construction of these experimental transmitters as long as the incumbent broadcasters are prepared to meet the cost of the trial receivers. The reason I have asked the commercial industry to meet the cost of the trial receivers is that they are very expensive at the moment because it is new technology and there is only a very low volume of production. But it is the least the industry can do if the government is meeting the cost of the transmitters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incumbent broadcasters have a very important role to play with the introduction of digital radio in Australia. If members of the public in the gallery today are asked to buy a new radio receiver that can pick up these digital radio transmissions, at the very least they will want to know what sorts of radio stations they will be able to pick up on digital radio. The best way to let the public know what new stations they can pick up is to say, `At the very least, you will get the incumbent broadcasters as well as some new licensees.' The government is also committed to making sure that national broadcasters&mdash;for example, Triple J&mdash;and community broadcasters also have a role to play in the move to digital FM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have established a digital radio advisory committee, to be chaired by Victoria Rubenshon, to give the government advice. It will act as a forum for the broadcasters, the regulators and the manufacturers of the equipment. In that way, the government can get fair and reasonable advice. I have asked this committee to release a discussion paper on digital radio by February next year and to provide recommendations on policy options for the government by July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FARB convention also addressed a number of other issues, such as the level of Australian music on radio. Mr Speaker, I am sure you will be pleased to note that a central coast radio station, Coast Rock, received for the second year running the Brian White Memorial Award for best news coverage. On that note, I can only commend all of those broadcasters who are working so hard with the government in introducing the latest communications reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it is in broadcasting or radio communications or the reform of Australia Post or encouraging Telstra to get up into Asia, it is this government that is introducing the reforms and making sure that Australia is a leader, not a follower, in communications. The only response we get from the opposition to communications when we go through all of the headland speeches is the Leader of the Opposition saying that the arts and communications industry would make a great guinea pig for the Howard-Costello industrial relations laboratory. There is no reference at all to the massive social changes that will take place through the introduction of new communications technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reference to an opposition policy on communications that I can find in the newspapers is a claim that not Senator Alston but the former member for Bass, Warwick Smith, is currently drawing up the opposition's communications policy.

What commentary is it on the rest of the frontbench, the members of the opposition's communications policy committee or the rest of the backbenchers?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government commissioned the report by the PSA because it was concerned about this issue. The PSA came up with a very thorough consideration of the issues some six weeks or so ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PSA certainly thought that the banks needed to move to ensure there was equitable access. It was particularly critical of the account keeping fee, the $2 per month, which applies only to people with accounts of less than $500&mdash;or, in the case of one bank, $300&mdash;with some exceptions. Ninety per cent of the fees that are paid by people with retail transaction accounts is the account keeping fee. Very little comes from transactions. The PSA recommended that the banks should seek to come up with their own solutions to meet the concerns. They were particularly advised to get rid of the account keeping fee and the inward dishonoured cheque fee and to otherwise ensure that there is reasonable access to the system for people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of last week's statements by the Commonwealth Bank, I was not quite entirely sure that they were moving in that direction, but I understand they certainly are now and that they are fully considering the issues. The PSA and I have asked the banks for a report by 15 September on what progress they are making in moving towards a full response to the PSA inquiry. We expect that that will give us some reasonable idea of where the banks are headed. If the banks were not to respond appropriately and adequately to the concerns that we have raised and which are expressed in the honourable member's question we would, as I have indicated, certainly be prepared to look at a legislated approach.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I have seen reports of statements by the Leader of the Opposition regarding coalition superannuation policy. I am sure members of the House will recall that the Leader of the Opposition, in his budget speech in this House, said, `On a change of government any existing retirement benefits will be preserved.' So he was saying that the policy of the opposition in respect of the superannuation guarantee, which is currently legislated and in place and providing benefits to workers, and in respect of the future benefits which are outlined in the budget, was that `existing retirement benefits will be preserved'. Existing retirement benefits under the superannuation guarantee are six per cent for large companies and five per cent for small companies. That is the percentage of the employee's pay which has to be paid into a superannuation fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition policy at the last election, as I am sure people will recall, was to freeze the SGC at whatever level it was when the opposition came into office. The words of the Leader of the Opposition in his response in this House on the budget are totally consistent with that, so presumably the policy has not changed: existing retirement benefits will be preserved; there will be no improvement in those benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means in terms of individual superannuation entitlements is very considerable. A 25-year-old person who has been in the work force for the last few years would lose about 56 per cent of his potential superannuation benefit because he would not get the further improvement under the superannuation guarantee up to nine per cent by the year 2002 and the initiatives outlined in the budget in respect of the employee contributions, the government co-contributions, would not be in place. That would be a loss for that person of $230,000 in today's dollars&mdash;a very substantial reduction in retirement benefits for a person aged 25 today on average weekly earnings through his working life. For someone in the same situation and working for a small employer the loss would be about 64 per cent of the potential benefit or $257,500 in today's dollars. That is the impact of the opposition's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I gave those figures in a speech recently, the Leader of the Opposition said that I was being completely dishonest and that this was another example of lies from the government. All we are doing is pointing out the implications of the opposition's policy as given in this House by the Leader of the Opposition. So how can he deny the fact that the implication of his policy is very substantial reductions in superannuation benefits for individual Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the implications for national savings? The superannuation measures are a major element of the plan to improve national savings in this country and, by that means, to address the balance of payments current account deficit. One of the lines that the opposition has been running is that the superannuation improvements will not do anything for savings for decades. In the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Australia cannot be sitting around to the year 2020 to try to address this problem&mdash;as though it was only in the year 2020 you would get some improvement in savings from superannuation. The opposition leader said that if we are prepared to wait until 2042 we might see a sufficiently large increase in national savings to bring the current account deficit under control. Both of those statements are totally and utterly absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, under the superannuation policy that we have in place and have announced, there will be a rapid increase in savings coming from superannuation in the next few years&mdash;not in the year 2020 or 2042, but in the next few years. Superannuation today is adding about half a per cent of GDP to national savings through the superannuation guarantee. By the year 2000 that is expected to be two per cent of GDP per annum, an improvement of another 1 1/2 per cent in just that next five years. So we are looking at a major boost to savings coming from superannuation in the next few years and in the following five years after that there will be another one per cent coming from superannuation as a boost to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of that is that the opposition's policy of freezing benefits&mdash;only preserving existing benefits&mdash;would mean that superannuation as a contributor to savings would be greatly reduced, the major boost to savings in the next five years would not eventuate and the further boost in the following five years would not eventuate. So this policy is one which is very much against the interests of working people, because their retirement benefits would be greatly reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also one which is very much against the interests of the country as a whole, because it takes away one of the key elements of savings policy. We all agree that savings improvement is a major means by which this country can address the current account deficit. So all this talk about concern about the current account deficit we hear from the opposition sits very oddly with their superannuation policy, which would mean less savings and less capacity to address the current account deficit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has been instrumental in ensuring that this conference is one of commitments rather than a talkfest, and we will be making sure that we say what Australian women want and how we propose to address those wants. We have been conferring with Australian women for some time and what they have come back and told us very clearly is that Australian women in 1995 are concerned, firstly, about difficulties in balancing their work and family responsibilities. They are fearful of the threat of violence still, particularly in their own homes. Health is also an issue of concern, especially about indigenous women, and many Australian women want to see more women take up positions of decision making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very clear that a lot of women do have considerable difficulties juggling the demands of work and family lives, because they still have the major job to do in relation to domestic responsibilities. Leading up to the conference, as part of the government's commitment to help women cope with these different roles, we will be, amongst other things, expanding the highly successful working women's centres so that women know their rights and entitlements under industrial law as it applies in each of the states of Australia. At the moment, Western Australia and Victoria do not have such centres, and I am sure women in those states will welcome their establishment. Given the very draconian direction that both Richard Court and Jeff Kennett are taking in industrial relations in these states, women will certainly need the protection and the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has also asked the National Information Services Council to look at how the new information technologies can respond particularly to the needs of women at home and ensure that those women are properly trained.</PARA>

Clearly, since there are different levels of government and different agencies involved, we need an integrated community response.

The key issue here, and the poll that the people of Western Australia want to see run, concerns questions about why the Court government, with the connivance of the Howard coalition, is spending between $5 million and $6 million on a royal commission. Why are they spending $5 million to $6 million of taxpayers' funds for a political exercise, Mr Speaker? Why are they seeking to abuse judicial processes in an attempt to destroy a political opponent? They are good questions for a poll.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 June this year, the member for Deakin did raise some allegations concerning a prominent Melbourne lawyer, Mr Mark Leibler, and the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael Costello. He alleged that they were involved in the corrupt receipt of some $US640,000 from an official of the Surinam embassy in the Hague. At the time Mr Aldred also implicated the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset, Mr Leibler and Mr Costello totally denied Mr Aldred's claims, but clearly those claims had to be investigated. At the time I referred the member's allegations to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. At the time of the speech, Mr Aldred did claim to have documents to support his allegations. I therefore wrote to him to urge him to make those documents available to the Australian Federal Police. I also wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, urging him to ensure the cooperation of the member of his party with that investigation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Deakin did reply to me, assuring me that the gravity of the issues involved is fully appreciated, and I table a copy of his response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I have received from the police a briefing regarding their investigation. They have advised me that, at this stage, their investigation has failed to reveal any evidence to support the allegations against Mr Costello. I repeat that there is no evidence to support those allegations at this stage. I use those words carefully because the police have been unable to finalise their investigation. They advise me that, although the member for Deakin has made available some assistance, he says that he has further information which he has declined or refused to hand over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Deakin has indicated that he may provide that evidence before Christmas. I believe that to be an unacceptable situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in answer to an earlier question, I think it is quite clear, and certainly the response I have been getting from the community suggests, that the opposition has seriously overplayed its hand. Having been involved in the establishment of the commission, their motivation has not been to uncover the truth. What they have tried to say is that there is a suggestion here&mdash;the member for Chisholm, the member for Mackellar and the member for O'Connor have come out and said publicly&mdash;that I, Carmen Lawrence, am responsible for the death of a woman. That is why they got interested in this matter. That was raised earlier by the member for Chisholm in a very public way. It has always been the tantalising bit of scandal associated with these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everybody in the community understands that were I a private citizen these matters would not be raised. The obscene suggestions that have been made in public in some cases by members opposite need to be repudiated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, members opposite and Richard Court in Western Australia have thrown out the window long traditions relating not only to cabinet confidentiality but also to the privilege of individual members of parliament. They have basically said that it is okay to go back into the cabinet meetings of a previous government, to hand over records to a royal commission without reference to the previous government, to give them cabinet agendas, minutes and diaries without reference to the previous government; in other words, to overturn a principle that you once upheld on your side. You resisted calls in the past by one of your former members, as Gerard Henderson pointed out this morning, to go back into a cabinet in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the members on this side who have been ministers, all of you on that side&mdash;and there are not many of you&mdash;who have been ministers, all of the people around the state parliaments know that when you sign up you basically say that this is something you swear to and you will discuss without fear or favour various matters that arise from time to time. Members opposite have been prepared to say, `We'll throw aside not just 100 years of Australian political convention but hundreds and hundreds of years of convention in other parts of the world for short-term political gain.' As I mentioned, one former cabinet member in David Smith has been prepared to stand up to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other principle that members opposite have wanted to just throw aside, as if it were of no importance, was the right of the individual member of parliament to stand up in here without fear or favour and actually say things that cannot be readily said necessarily outside, to have a last recourse through the parliament. What Mr Court has said is that the executive, through its agent which is the royal commission, can overturn that principle. Individuals can be trampled on by the executive willy-nilly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of parliament now, according to this commission, have no rights. Only the parliament can decide collectively, and those people who know the parliament of Western Australia know that the upper house in that place has been controlled by the conservatives since responsible government, for 100 years. Getting that parliament to say anything about the privilege of individual members is very difficult. Even that upper house has said that Mr Halden, in tabling that petition, was not in breach of the privileges of the parliament. But Mr Court comes along and says, `No, I will have a royal commission', against the advice of his deputy, against the advice of the Leader of the National Party, against the advice of his senior adviser, Mr Richard Elliott. He took advice from people who have a clear interest in political destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission has been established for political purposes. Inevitably, those people who become involved in it either by supporting it, defending it or getting involved in any way will be criticised, and rightly so, by the Australian community. Members opposite will need to look very carefully at what they have done here. In time they will have cause to reflect, because the narrow terms of reference, the overturning of these principles, the fact that Richard Court will not be called to account for the involvement of the Liberal Party&mdash;his and others in this matter&mdash;are matters of great shame for the Australian community and they can see right through you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. This is a very significant summit being held in Parliament House this afternoon, followed tomorrow by a conference. It has been arranged by the Australian Consumers Council, my advisory council, and has attracted some leading international figures in the areas of future technologies, global planning, sustainable consumption and so on&mdash;people like Colin Benjamin, who was a Director of Ogilvy and Mather's Futures Divisions for six years, and Sixto Roxas, a prominent international speaker and author who is President of the Asian Institute of Management and Vice-Chair of the Foundation for Philippine Environment.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is about anticipating the future and follows on from work we are doing in the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and in my office.

We have to anticipate consumers' rights now for the future.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In explaining the government's position on this, I want to run through the defence that they have put on behalf of this minister and show how absolutely without foundation that defence is. I will then repeat the view of the coalition and substantiate why it is that the minister ought to, at the very least, step aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say that this book of rules does not contain any sense of the very proper standards which a government ought to adhere to, nor does it contain any recognition of the importance of sticking to basic principles in the administration of government. I suppose it was rather well put by the verbose Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) when he was asked a question the other day about whether ministers caught lying should resign or be sacked. He said, `It is a totally hypothetical question'&mdash;a pretty fair way to answer the question! He was asked to give an explanation of what standards should be applied and he said, `For us, it is hypothetical.' Hypothetical it is, because no standards are applied by them, and that is a large part of the problem which they have got themselves into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence the government has used has basically followed seven or eight guidelines. The first was the initial defence by the minister, which was brought down not years later but within days of the events concerning the tabling of the petition. I make that point because one of the defences that the government has run is that it is only a matter of recollection because this all happened years ago. The nub of this debate is what the minister said at the very time of the controversy&mdash;within days of it, not years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first leg of any defence from these people is basically a pattern of distortion. The distortion which this minister is very much caught on is the one which she repeated in the Western Australia parliament on 10 November 1992, when she said, `I learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling.' That is a statement which we now know to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second classic defence from these people is to run a smear campaign against anybody who contradicts the line that they are running. I thought it was bad enough when the minister, through her press office, had a member of her staff in the press gallery smearing her former colleague Keith Wilson. This smear was basically to the effect that his marbles were loose&mdash;he was sick up here in the head. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had distortion, smears and a general attack on the commission. The latest one is that the commission would not accede to the minister's request to give her evidence this week. This is pretty hot from this minister. She has been using taxpayers' funds to close down the commission. She was then publicly telling the commission who it was that she wanted to give evidence in the commission. Now, when she has a bit of political heat on her&mdash;and only for that reason&mdash;she demands from the commission that she jump the queue and be heard before those whom she otherwise wanted to be heard so as to put the entirety of the case to the commission. It was a classic case of attacking the commission and was preceded by this unprecedented attack funded by the Australian taxpayer to basically close down the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says a lot about this government's tactics that it should be prepared to use taxpayers' moneys to fund not the appearance of the minister before the commission but a separate legal challenge outside the commission in the WA Supreme Court, and up to the High Court at one stage, so as to prevent the commission from operating it at all. I think it is a good thing that the Senate has been prepared to establish a committee to review the basis upon which taxpayers' moneys are being used&mdash;something like $10,000 a day&mdash;because the commitment by the government to pay those legal fees must be a matter of doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government first defended the legal payment, it put down a tabling statement dated 28 June 1995, which was an explanation of the rationale for the legal costs. The initial statement makes the point that the government will not be tabling a legal opinion. In other words, we had a statement from the Attorney-General and that is all we were going to get. It is a mark of the pressure on the government that, when more questions were asked, it finally did produce a legal opinion. It said it would not, but ultimately it felt it had to. The Solicitor-General's opinion&mdash;interestingly, dated very late in the piece, 22 August; which makes me think there must have been one earlier, but we will leave that matter for the Senate committee&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the public acknowledgment by those initiating and supporting the Marks Commission, as well as those opposing it, that the matters being inquired of are directed to the issue of Dr Lawrence's continuing fitness for public office as a Commonwealth minister, these matters are open to be regarded by Cabinet as directly relevant to her continuing to carry out her functions as a minister.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very interesting statement because the Solicitor-General says, `Well, you can use the taxpayers' money because this issue goes to her continuing fitness as a Commonwealth minister.' Yet all of the responses that we have had from both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the minister in this place are that this commission's findings are irrelevant to her continuing fitness as a minister. In fact, she actually put out a statement the other day which recounted the number of office appointments and functions she had attended this year compared to last year to prove her point that her position as a minister and her continuing fitness was unimpaired by the royal commission. We have a very interesting, and yet to be resolved, conflict of what this government says in respect of legal costs. We await with very great interest the Senate committee's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have distortion, smear and attacking the messenger&mdash;the senior counsel assisting the commission. We have the attempt to close down the commission. It is all part of the campaign and the tactics. We then have the old defence of `reorganise your story'. This has taken a number of different twists in recent days. I suppose the government got this one up and running when the minister went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> about a week ago and said, `It's not really so much a matter of what I remember, but it's really all a matter of recollections. It is not so much a matter of what I definitively said and whether I lied, but really whether or not people had differing recollections.' We were told that some had a recollection of this and some had a recollection of that. The government reorganised the story to basically attempt to change the goalposts and to soften the penultimate decision to be made by the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that, the government moved on to defence strategy number six&mdash;that is, to establish the defences. The defence is a classic from the Labor Party. The first one is to attack the opposition. It was just amazing. It went back to the debate of the 1983 election campaign to attack us. Regardless of what happened in 1983, let us assume that absolutely everything it said did happen. So what! What is the defence? The defence that it is putting is that there is some doubt about something we might have said in the past and that is somehow a defence for what Dr Lawrence said in the past. This is the `two wrongs make a right' defence. It is an absolutely baseless one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we have had every defence in the world from these people, including the Madonna whore defence, which I thought was particularly low. We have had the `prepare the ground, walk away from the commission' defence. We have had a distortion defence, we have had `change the goalposts defence' and we have had the `let's fund it with the taxpayers' money' defence&mdash;none of which will count for anything. </PARA>

They have not succeeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that, in circumstances where a lovely young person lost her life by taking her own life, this sort of development has now built into a national issue. Once any political party moves into that area of playing politics, the public is entitled to ask certain questions. There is, as we have heard, a royal commission. At present there is also a second court running in this parliament on the very same issues, which is very concerning to many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a hypothetical case of some of the questions the public could be asking. Let me take us back to the last time that this opposition was in power and they were making decisions about which they were answering questions in parliament. This is what it is about: has the leader of a political party in the Western Australian parliament told an untruth, or did she give a version which is accurate according to her recollection of the time? We are going back in history for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I, as an opposition member of parliament, found when I first came to this parliament in 1980 was a government thrashing around in great difficulty with economics. The Treasurer at that time was John Howard. All of the accepted major measures of performance had proved at that time that the seven years of that government, of which Mr Howard and Mr Lynch were Treasurers, were an economic disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, their major strategy at the time was to fight inflation first. It failed because it was the only policy they had. Regardless of the fact that that government had been receiving at the time reports which had gone to cabinet&mdash;the Campbell report in particular&mdash;recommending deregulation of the financial structures of Australia, as often as John Howard went into cabinet and put the case as Treasurer on behalf of those findings he was rolled time and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that my constituents are asking me is: what is this cabinet confidentiality bit all about? They want to know what we are talking about. We are talking about a principle in government where ministers are able and free&mdash;and they must have that freedom&mdash;to go into a cabinet discussion and put their case. If a Treasurer such as Mr Howard did not have the ability and did not have the numbers to win their case, very many times they have to come into this House and put the cabinet's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How would John Howard look today if the accusation was made to him that he had misled this House because of giving the cabinet decision? Obviously, he was telling a totally different position to what he had been arguing in cabinet. He was going on the public record in this chamber and with the press, telling the Australian people what the cabinet decision was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it within the realms of possibility that upon losing government because of the mismanagement of John Howard's cabinet that a royal commission should have been set up to demand evidence from those cabinet discussions in order to prove that he had told a fib? Of course, he was not telling lies to this parliament. The people in my electorate, and I am sure people in the whole of Australia, want to know what this is all about. If somebody comes into the parliament and states what they believe happened in cabinet, it is opposite to what they may have argued very strongly for in cabinet and that is made public, is that accusing those people of telling a lie? Of course it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the fabrication that is going on here? What are we trying to prove by bringing a person who is now a minister in another government, a minister in the federal sphere, before an inquiry on the basis that she told some untruth to the House in Western Australia? Is that the basis of what this is about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go a little further to some of the matters that John Howard was involved in in the past. He went into cabinet on many occasions and argued a case for change. It is common knowledge that he could not succeed, that he was rolled by his own people. Yet he came into this place as the Treasurer and at times when he lost a debate in cabinet he had to put the cabinet's position. All governments have that situation, and all Treasurers and all leaders go through that, which the public is aware of. Those who are not aware of that are asking questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening in Western Australia is a blatant attack on the democratic processes that generations of our people have built up in Australia. I will be very interested to hear the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) when he makes his speech on this very matter. Is he prepared to tell us whether something that is argued vehemently in cabinet by particular ministers is a lie when they come in here and put the cabinet's decision after they have been defeated in cabinet. Of course it is not. It is a ridiculous suggestion to be putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a former leader of a government and an opposition in Western Australia being asked to justify something of recollection. The member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said in his speech that this was recollection versus record. That is what this is about: recollection versus record. On the recollections she has no charge to answer but, if the record is brought out of a cabinet meeting in confidence and this approach by Western Australia demands that cabinet solidarity be broken, this will be an attempt to destroy not only the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) but also democracy in Australia. We cannot possibly allow that to happen. If it does happen, I fear for those people who are asking this very question of me: what is going on in relation to this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the point in the debate and in the public knowledge where people will continue to ask these questions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no illegality charge against that minister for that minister's responsibilities to her portfolio in this parliament&mdash;none whatsoever. If there was, I expect that she, like other ministers, would have stood down a long time ago. Had she been accused in an investigation of allegations relating to her responsibilities to this parliament, I have no doubt of her integrity and what would have happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that the public of Australia is now asking is: what did she do in Western Australia? She told an untruth, they say&mdash;that is the allegation&mdash;to the Western Australian parliament. On the criteria of cabinet discussion, how many untruths have been told here with people putting the government's position or the opposition's position that was the dead opposite to what they argued for in the decision making processes of cabinet and shadow cabinet? This is a dreadful farce as far as democracy in Australia is concerned and one that the Australian people need to keep asking questions about because it is the crucial issue that may decide where our democracy goes in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a couple of points about the hypothetical case involving John Howard that I put before. I quote from an article of 14 March 1983.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Treasurer, Mr Howard, yesterday admitted that he knew the deficit for next financial year would start at around $8000 million long before he mentioned the figure of $6000 million during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second damaging admission about the deficit since the 5 March election, Mr Howard said on the `Sunday' show (Channel 9) that he had the information early this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course he had that information&mdash;it was given to him in cabinet. Surely we are not suggesting here that there should have been an inquiry at that point into John Howard. He was freely admitting that what he had presented to this parliament was his government's position, his cabinet's position. We did not go about setting up a royal commission even though here were people admitting they had misled the Australian parliament, misled the Australian people, because in reality this is not a misleading of the parliament. It is not a misleading of the Australian people. It is the process of government in this country at work. The threat to that process is a very damaging event which is taking place in Western Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a few remarks today in question time about the counsel assisting the commission. There have obviously been some comments made in the Senate on this matter. I am sure my electors in McMillan will ask the same questions that are being asked today on that. If we are going to go down this destructive road against democracy, then they will ask why. Why would it be that they had to go outside Western Australia to find counsel to assist the commission? Surely there are barristers in Western Australia who are quite capable of supporting their own commission. Why did they go to South Australia? Why did they go to a family name: Vanstone? Was that necessary for legal purposes or has it been done for some other purposes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents also will be asking: who determines when witnesses will be called at this commission? Of course, it would not be the counsel for the commission who happens to be the sister-in-law of the shadow Attorney-General! They will find that that is so. The counsel assisting the commission does determine when witnesses will be called and the order of their appearance. We can understand why the request by the Minister for Human Services and Health to appear seems to be in some doubt at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not imputing the integrity of the counsel assisting the commission; but my people will certainly be asking: will the first draft of the report being prepared for the commission be done by that same counsel? Is there any link there in relation to this matter? I am sure the public will become very concerned the longer this goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident of the integrity of the minister in this government. The minister's performance as a minister in this government is not under question. Her role as an individual is not under question. Her honesty is not under question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers are very clear. As the public receives more information, and my constituents of McMillan get more information, the answers coming through will turn that wheel of the political issue around.

Universally, it was agreed that one of the clauses to be included was one headed `Honesty'. It is the second most significant heading, and what does it say?</PARA>

<PARA>Remember those questions to Dr Lawrence? Remember she had a press conference down at the National Press Club? It was interesting: on successive occasions she has been asked whether she was prepared to confirm her answer. She confirms her recollection; she does not confirm her answer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were confident of your honesty and confident of what you had said, why would you be ashamed to come into this place and say what you told the public? Is it because she feels she might transgress this code of ethical principles for ministers and presiding officers? Or is it that she accepts fundamentally that in Australian politics if you mislead the parliament and you are a minister you should resign?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that you understand that this lady is being examined because of matters for which she was responsible not in this parliament but in another.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the criteria for the Advance from the Minister for Finance. Look at the constitutional responsibility of each of us. I believe she has transgressed that. Indeed, Gavan Griffith refers in his opinion to a number of judgments, including the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, particularly subsection 4(4). I have not time to read it but what Dr Lawrence has received goes very close to breaching her responsibilities. </PARA>

There is a very good reason why the Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) are not presenting this matter of public importance before the House today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gather from the attitude of the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in their presentation to the House on this matter of public importance that their hearts are not really in the debate. There is no passion in the arguments they have put. It is clear to us all that they do not believe their own rhetoric when it comes to ministerial responsibility and propriety. There is a good reason for that: the coalition front bench is littered with the corpses of Liberal and National Party shadow ministers who have been caught with their pants down as far as standards of ministerial conduct are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the crux of this debate and reiterate: this government has always insisted on the highest standards of conduct from those it entrusts with ministerial and executive responsibility. I think that has been borne out by the excellent record of ministers who have served in the Hawke government and who now serve in the Keating Labor government. It is the Liberal and National parties which in recent history have flouted every much cherished convention in our political system. It is the Liberal and National parties that have given encouragement and succour to those who currently abuse the legal process in the Marks royal commission in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to dwell on the Marks royal commission but I want to say some very basic things about it. It must be one of the grubbiest, most vindictive and spurious exercises that has ever been set up for political purposes in this country. My advice to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;I gave it to her last Monday and I reiterated it in caucus today&mdash;is that under no circumstances must she bow to the rats that infest the political sewers in Western Australia. Under no circumstances should she bow to those people. </PARA>

We know that it is costing the Western Australian taxpayers $100,000 and possibly $200,000 a day to conduct. We know that it is the grossest abuse of the legal system that we have seen in the post-war era. We know that the Leader of the Opposition and members of his front bench have been liaising with Richard Court over the terms of reference of this inquiry and the details of it. It is nothing more than a kangaroo court and it will be condemned by the people for what it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying prior to being interrupted by question time, the parliament is discussing now the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2), which seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has considered a very large number of amendments brought forward by the government. We have concerns in four areas. I mentioned those in the House prior to question time. The first concern relates to the government's proposal to allow more prisoners to vote. We are concerned about the fact that returning officers will not be required to distribute voting papers to general postal voters as early as possible. We are also concerned over the proposed banning of canvassing within six metres of offices of the Australian Electoral Commission. Further, we are worried about the government's proposal to permit preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes to commence on the Monday prior to voting day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, however, quite happy with a large number of other matters included in the legislation. It is incumbent on us as members of parliament to ensure that the electoral system is as fair as it can be. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that after every federal poll there be an investigation of the previous election, and recommendations brought forward. I am sorry that the government has not picked up all of the recommendations brought forward by coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, who lodged a dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the amendments proposed in the legislation is a proposal to allow the Australian Electoral Commission greater flexibility in the method of conducting electoral roll reviews. Roll reviews are, of course, a very important means of ensuring that the electoral roll is kept clean. During 1992 the enrolment details of residents at over 5.7 million dwellings were checked. The 1992-93 annual report of the AEC identified 1.2 million persons, equivalent to 10.54 per cent of the enrolment, who were required to enrol and approximately 650,000 people&mdash;0.5 per cent of enrolled voters&mdash;who seemed to no longer reside at the address for which they were enrolled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fairly clear that in any democracy it is important to have regular habitation surveys. The amendments seek to increase the flexibility available to the AEC. The AEC, if this legislation becomes law, will no longer be restricted to conducting one-off roll reviews every two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In areas of high population growth such as the Sunshine Coast and many other parts of Queensland which currently face a redistribution every three years, it is entirely appropriate that reviews should take place more often. In areas of low population growth or declining population, such as many of those in the rust belt areas of southern Australia, it may not be necessary to have reviews as often as in other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to provide to the Australian Electoral Commission, which does a good job under difficult circumstances, the maximum flexibility to do its job as best it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the importance of having integrity in the voting system, one cannot help but cast one's mind back to the recent Queensland election. The state seat of Mundingburra was declared to be won by Labor by 16 votes out of 22,000 votes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter which is currently before the Court of Disputed Returns and there are a number of matters which the court, no doubt, in the fullness of time, will consider properly. For instance, I was concerned about the fact that 347 people cast declaration votes and those votes were not counted. But what particularly worried me was that the Electoral Commission there did not even look at the entitlement of those people to be on the roll. The Electoral Commission effectively tore up those votes. Obviously that is a matter which the court is going to have to look at very closely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a provision in the legislation before the House that permits electors going overseas to register as eligible overseas voters, which perhaps will be more convenient to many of them. Clearly, in the Mundingburra poll there were anomalies. A number of soldiers who were serving their country in Rwanda failed to receive their ballots. Those soldiers could well have decided the result in Mundingburra&mdash;they could well have decided that Wayne Goss would no longer be the Premier of Queensland&mdash;but, because of hiccups in the electoral system there, they did not have the right to vote. I am pleased to see the amendments currently before the chamber because, hopefully, they might prevent a repetition at the federal level of the kind of rort that occurred at the state level on those voters of Mundingburra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other sensible amendments provided for in the legislation include a provision for the rolls to close at 8 p.m. rather than 6 p.m. on the date of close of the rolls. It is pretty obvious these days, with more flexible working conditions, that many people working beyond 6 p.m. will need to enrol to vote between at least 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., particularly if they have recently moved to an area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very sensible provision also that, should a candidate who is one of a number of bulk nominated candidates die or withdraw before nominations are declared, the candidate's death or withdrawal will not affect the nomination of other candidates. Of course, there are several other administrative changes in relation to bulk nominations. The proposals before the House also provide that a person who is caring for a person who is seriously ill or infirm, and who is unable to attend a polling place to vote, may apply to register as a general postal voter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted&mdash;and this is very important from the point of view of those very many Australians who reside in remote rural and regional areas&mdash;that postal ballot papers and postal vote certificate envelopes will be sent to all registered general postal voters. Until now many of those people, because of delays in the postal system, have been denied their right to participate in the electoral process because all that has been sent to them has been an application for a postal vote. So, if there is a delay in the mail getting to them or a delay in the mail returning the application to the Electoral Commission and then a further delay in sending the ballot papers, it is fairly clear that in some parts of Australia those people might not have the opportunity of expressing their preference at the ballot box. Of course, people in all parts of Australia have the right to make a contribution, to decide which party is going to be the government of Australia and which party is going to be the opposition. </PARA>

Earlier I mentioned the problems that we had over the restriction on canvassing, preventing people from canvassing within six metres of a divisional office or pre-poll voting office because many of those offices are now located in shopping centres. A very sensible proposal will make it possible for people voting interstate to vote during the ordinary hours for voting in that state or territory. That will do away with the crazy situation at the present time where voters from my own state of Queensland who are visiting your own state of Western Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, would be prevented from casting their ballots between the hours of 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Western Standard Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support these amendments. We do have major concerns about the four items I mentioned previously. We have major concerns about ensuring that the voting system in this country has integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a substantial&mdash;substantial in volume, not content&mdash;contribution from a number of members opposite, much of it nonsense, in which they have referred to people being seen to vote more than once. If anyone does that, then obviously the book should be thrown at them. But the problem is more major than that. At the present time we have an honour system as far as our electoral system is concerned. Any person throughout the nation can fill in any number of enrolment cards, using any number of noms de plume, even using the envelopes provided by the Australian Electoral Commission, and without any check whatsoever those people are added onto the electoral rolls and those noms de plume are able to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the abolition of subdivisional voting, people who are voting under noms de plume are able to go to any number of the polling booths in any electorate or, for that matter, are even able to vote as absent voters elsewhere. Those votes are cast and, of course, there is absolutely no check until the next habitation survey when those people are cleaned off the roll. But, as I said a moment ago, the Australian Electoral Commission found during the last habitation survey that 650,000 people were enrolled at addresses where they did not live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those people, quite genuinely, would have moved, some of those people would not have been noms de plume, but at the moment our electoral system is open to wide scale rorting, particularly in marginal seats. I think it is absolutely disgusting that the government has not at this stage sought to introduce into the electoral bill a provision that people who are seeking enrolment have to provide perhaps the same 100 points as a pensioner opening a Commonwealth bank account has to provide. Surely, enrolling to vote on the electoral roll of Australia is at least as important as opening an account at the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of misleading comments have been made by colleagues opposite, and I particularly refer to the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), on compulsory voting. It is not coalition policy that we will scrap compulsory voting, although there is a wide range of views on our side of politics and a very healthy discussion taking place in the community. I am not going to resile from my very strong support for voluntary voting, but I want to stress that as a coalition we have not made any pledge or any decision at all on this matter. In the fullness of time, there will be a wide range of views in our party room and there will be a healthy debate, and we will democratically arrive at a decision one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be noted that compulsory enrolment was introduced in 1911. Between 1901 and 1911 we had no compulsory enrolment. Compulsory voting did not arrive until 1924. I think the honourable member for Lilley referred to one election where there was a 58 per cent turnout. Australia is the only English speaking democracy in the world to have compulsory voting, and there are only three democracies in the world which have compulsory voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that, in many countries where there is voluntary voting, the voting percentage is similar to the voting percentage in countries where there is compulsory voting. One only has to look at the situation in New Zealand. They have a voluntary voting system and 88 to 90 per cent of people go out and vote. In the United Kingdom, it is about 78 per cent. Up until compulsory voting was introduced in Australia we had a very high voter turnout in most instances. For instance, the 1917 election had a 78 per cent turnout. I think the election being referred to somewhat spuriously by the honourable member for Lilley was probably the 1922 election. That election day was 16 December&mdash;the Saturday immediately prior to Christmas when many people obviously would be away&mdash;and I might add that it was also designated as the dullest election since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in a democracy people have the right to vote, I believe they should have the right not to vote, and I think it is absolutely scandalous that the Labor Party gaoled more than 50 people for not voting at the last election. I think, though, that it is important to make sure we have integrity in the voting system. All of us on all sides of the parliament should seek to achieve this. I support most of the amendments introduced by this legislation. I am sorry the government has not gone further. I hope that the government will bring further amendments in to support the principles that we as a coalition have advocated most strongly in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. I commend the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) on the amendments contained in this bill. This is the second parliament in which I have served on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. A number of recommendations made by that committee which inquired into the last election are being enacted. In some instances, the exact recommendations of the committee have not been followed by the minister and the government; there have been some variations to the committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that needs to be made is that we as a parliamentary committee are continually monitoring each election. There is no doubt that the opposition&mdash;certainly in the two parliaments in which I have been a member of the committee&mdash;have been going on a bit of a fishing expedition to try to expose weaknesses in the electoral system, but I think they have failed. What has come through in the committee's inquiries is the fact that we can be very proud of the conduct of elections in Australia. There have been a number of close contests in a number of seats, and the integrity of those results has really been beyond dispute. When complaints have been made, they have been looked at. In a lot of instances, those complaints have been found to be spurious. That does not mean to say that we cannot continually refine the Electoral Act. That is basically what this bill does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to talk about some amendments to be moved on behalf of the government that will allow some changes for prisoners. We are proposing that someone who is serving a sentence of five years or longer for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth be excluded from voting. We are looking at the actual sentence. Given the proposed amendments of the opposition and the hysterical campaign that they have run to date, I think it is worth looking at the history of prisoners and voting. I support very strongly the recommendations that we are bringing forward. On page 142 of our report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The report of the inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related thereto</EMPHASIS>, the following history is given:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Act disqualifies from enrolment and voting any prisoner under sentence for an offence punishable for five years or longer. The Act provides that Controllers-General of Prisons shall, on a monthly basis, provide the AEC with lists of such prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for disqualification is therefore the potential sentence for an offence, not the actual sentence imposed.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC also suggested that the disqualification provisions are potentially inequitable:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">because the exclusion from enrolment refers to a potential rather than an actual sentence, a person serving an actual sentence of one month could be excluded from enrolment, while a person on a sentence of 59 months could be eligible, depending on the potential maximum sentence in each case. Thus the present legislation takes no account of the Court's assessment of the seriousness of the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEC submitted that the basis for disqualification should be an actual, rather than potential, sentence of five years or more.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to be moved on behalf of the government pick up those points. The committee further recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that subsection 93(8)(b) and section 109 of the Electoral Act be repealed, so that an elector is not deprived of the right to enrol or vote on the basis that the elector is a prisoner (except in the event of a conviction for treason or treachery).</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that a dissenting report from the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), Senator Minchin, Senator Tierney and the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was submitted at page 165, but that is not the first time the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has made a recommendation in that regard. It is worth noting what our predecessors in the 34th parliament had to say. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommended that enrolment and voting rights be granted to all prisoners, regardless of their sentence. In support of this recommendation, the committee argued that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an offender once punished under the law should not incur the additional penalty of loss of the franchise. We also note that a principal aim of the modern criminal law is to rehabilitate offenders and orient them positively towards the society they will re-enter on their release. We consider that this process is assisted by a policy of encouraging offenders to observe their civil and political obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>The government included that recommendation in a proposed amendment to the Electoral and Referendum Bill 1989. However, the amendment was rejected by the Senate. The present committee did re-examine the issue and did agree with the conclusions of its predecessors. In addition to encouraging prisoners to observe their civil obligations, we felt that the proposed change would be far simpler administratively than the existing arrangements. Yet we have the opposition carrying on a bit of a scare campaign. I repeat what the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Act disqualifies from enrolment and voting any prisoner under sentence for an offence punishable for five years or longer.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the Australian Electoral Commission's recommendation that we should be concentrating on an actual rather than a potential sentence for administrative reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wants to take it back even further. Their proposed amendment is that we should omit five years and substitute 12 months. I notice that Mr Connolly was seeking some consistency with the constitution. The constitution prohibits people from entering this place if they have been subjected to a sentence of 12 months or more. I would suggest that we should not look at the provisions in the constitution because we are not talking about people entering the parliament; we are talking about people voting and participating in the process of electing members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are inconsistencies between the people who are qualified to sit in this place and the people who vote. The classic case was Cleary v. Sykes. The High Court said that you cannot have dual citizenship and retain your seat in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, you are disqualified from having the citizenship of another country; and I agree with the High Court. There are a number of eligible voters in the electorate who have dual citizenship and who are able to vote, but it is more restrictive if you want to be a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes to introduce some legislation which formalises dual citizenship arrangements. The argument is that, if we maintain our present position and people lose the citizenship of another country when they acquire Australian citizenship, we are discriminating against Australian citizens. A number of people retain Greek citizenship. There is no consistency in relation to dual citizenship for members of parliament and eligible voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is the same with this bill. Obviously, pursuant to the constitution, the rules should be restrictive for those people who want to hold office as a member of parliament, but I do not think they should be as restrictive. One of the reasons that I reject the opposition's amendment is that I do not think you can be consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is only prisoners who have convictions of treason or treachery who should be disqualified from voting. Prisoners should not be treated as second class citizens. In the previous conservative government in New South Wales, when Yabsley was the Minister for Corrective Services, prisoners were treated as second class citizens. It seems to me that there is a double penalty. I think prisoners have certain rights. We, in a civilised society, should continue to allow them to enjoy those rights. In my opinion, they are entitled to lobby for certain conditions, amongst other things. We should be getting as many people as possible, as I say, with the exceptions of treason and treachery&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not picked up that recommendation of the committee. The government brought its original proposals before the parliament and it has gone back a step or two. We are not opening up the floodgates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corrective services are saying to us as a parliament, `We are not able to administer that.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I only raise this point because it has been introduced in the debate. I think it is very important that it not be left lie as it has been. Compulsory voting has assisted us as a community to participate and accept the result in close elections. Also, instead of members of the community feeling as though they are disenfranchised from the system because of their not voting or whatever and resorting to other methods of violence and civil disobedience, the way they can participate in the system is to come along at election time and register a vote for or against. I think that is one of the reasons we are a much more tolerant society than some overseas countries. People can have their names marked off the roll and they can register an informal vote if they do not really want to vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments that are being proposed fall into a number of categories. It is good to see the opposition is supporting other sections of the bill. In the main, I think there has been bipartisanship on the committee in the two terms of parliament which I have been serving in. We tend to differ on a bit of the philosophy and around the edges but when it comes to legislation, in the main, it has passed with bipartisan support across the chamber. I think that is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members on the other side of the House do have some genuine and legitimate concerns in relation to the operation of the Electoral Commission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not introduce this McCarthyist campaign against prisoners and say that just because someone has committed an offence every right they enjoy should be taken away from them. I do not believe people in a civilised society should be punished two or three times or continually punished for the same crime. The courts will determine, on the facts before them, the gravity of the situation they are dealing with and sentence them accordingly. The basis of this amendment the government has proposed is that if prisoners are sentenced to an actual term of imprisonment of five years or more&mdash;that in itself highlights the gravity of the offence for which the court has dealt with that person&mdash;they should be disqualified from voting. </PARA>

We are talking about human beings who might be white-collar criminals, who might have committed crimes of passion, who might be petty thieves or whatever. Their crimes are not crimes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join in the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2). I start on a positive note by congratulating the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) for one of the amendments he is moving, which will extend the right for registered postal voters in remote areas to be sent ballot papers as soon as the election is called and not as previously existed. Previously, those voters were sent application forms which they had to fill in and send back. They were then sent the ballot papers, which they had to fill in and send back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of mailings will be reduced from four to two. The significance of this in remote areas is that if you receive one mail service a week&mdash;some receive less than that&mdash;it currently takes at least four weeks to get your vote in. If you happen to miss a mail because you are out in the back paddock mustering or something when the mailman arrives, then you may not get your vote in. That disenfranchised several hundred voters every time an election was called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that I congratulate the minister for that, but particularly so because he overruled a majority report of the government members and supported the coalition minority dissenting report. That was indeed pleasing to see. No doubt he has his reasons for doing so. I understand that he believes it will favour the government in the electorate of Leichhardt. If it does, good on him. Everybody should have an opportunity to cast their vote. I am not going to go into this in detail because I detailed my reasons for supporting this particular amendment on 21 June at page 1948 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states have been doing this for many years in relation to registered postal voters. In New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia, ballot papers are posted out straightaway. An incident of fraud has never occurred by sending out the ballot papers as soon as the election is called. I think it brings great shame on the government members of the committee, who opposed this in fairly vigorous debate for week after week in the face of evidence, not only from the members of the coalition but also from the Australian Electoral Commission, whose evidence was quite overwhelming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment's being brought in saves the taxpayer $40,000 on postage and administration costs. That is not to be sneezed at. We are talking about only 9,623 registered postal voters in Australia that fall into this category. That is less than 0.1 per cent of the total voting population in this country. Nevertheless, the principle is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we have precedent for it. The states have been doing this for years. We also have a federal precedent for  this. Physically incapacitated people and people who are infirm and cannot sign documents can register in this way and be sent the ballot papers immediately the election is called. That amounts to only about 550 people, I think, but when that has been done previously in federal elections the response rate has been almost 100 per cent. There has never been an instance of fraud. At the last count there were 3,157 households in Australia that received only one mail delivery a week. Some receive less. With more than one voter, on average, living in each household, we are talking about several thousand voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to move on to the contentious issue of prisoner voting. I particularly applaud the coalition amendment, which will change the criteria for disqualification from voting from a sentence of in excess of five years in gaol, as the government is proposing, to a sentence of 12 months in gaol. Subsection 93(8)(b) presently refers to someone who:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"has been convicted and is under sentence for an offence punishable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>punishable is the operative word here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory by imprisonment for five years or longer."</PARA>
<PARA>That means that, under the present system, anyone who is in for a possible maximum sentence of five years or longer, even though they may have actually received a lesser sentence, such as two or three years, has had their voting affected in that manner. In other words, it is done on the potential sentence rather than the actual sentence. I agree with the principle of moving to the actual sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes the amendment to apply to someone who `is serving a sentence of 5 years or longer for an offence against the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory'. The government says the reason it is doing this is that gaol officials cannot provide this sort of information because they only have on the record the actual sentence and not the potential sentence. I would have thought if you wanted to correct that anomaly for that reason alone you would simply make a requirement that when a person is sentenced you write down on the sheet that records their name, address, sex, age and everything else, not only the offence and the actual sentence but also the potential sentence. That would be the best way of getting over this. What we are talking about here today with the government's amendment is, in a sense, a second-best solution, not that I have any particular objection to changing it to actual sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was, it is worth noting, the original ALP policy, before they brought this amendment in, that every prisoner be extended the right to vote. That, indeed, was the view of the government majority report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters. It was the government's position, adopted until there was a great outcry in the community and the government became embarrassed and thought they would lose some votes over this. So they said, `We will not extend it.' But, of course, they actually have extended it to several hundred more prisoners, who potentially are getting the right to vote. They have not done it for any high-minded principle. It has been done for politically expedient reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, though, to look at the consequence of extending it to five years actual.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), said that he is worried about the withdrawal of prisoners' civil liberties. When you go to gaol, you lose a number of civil liberties. You are not allowed to walk down the street any more at will, you cannot visit the beach, you cannot play cricket, you cannot go to a shopping centre and browse or shop or whatever. I believe one of the civil rights you should lose is the right to vote. It is a privilege and it is one of those privileges that should be withdrawn when you go to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at what happens in the states. If I read the state legislation correctly, it says that in South Australia all prisoners now have the right to vote. That is at one end of the spectrum. At the other end, in Tasmania no prisoner gets the right to vote. In between that, we have a mix. In Victoria, it is very similar to the present Commonwealth legislation where if you are in for a punishable offence of five years or more you cannot vote. In Queensland, unless they have changed it recently, if you are in for six months or more you cannot vote. In Western Australia and New South Wales, if you are in for 12 months or more you lose your right to vote. I think in the ACT it is similar to the situation in the Commonwealth. In the Northern Territory, everybody is allowed to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in the Commonwealth parliament the law used to be 12 months or more until 1983 when this present government came to power. They changed it and it became law on 1 February 1984. It was extended from 12 months to five years. You can see that this government is very much in favour indeed of giving prisoners the right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter I would raise about prisoners and voting. Something like 11 million Australians at present cast a vote. With extremely rare exceptions, they only have one choice as to the electorate in which they may register as being qualified to vote&mdash;and that is, of course, the place in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with prisoners it is quite different. The legislation is somewhat confused, as I read the wording of it. But it seems to me that they have at least five choices as to which electorate they may vote in, for heaven's sake. They can choose to enrol in the electorate they were in before they went to gaol; they can enrol in the electorate they were entitled to be in before they went to gaol; or they can enrol in an electorate in which any of their next of kin are enrolled. I just find this extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prisoner can choose their electorate from that of their brother, their sister, their father, their mother, and so on. They can pick their electorate. If there were six, eight or 10 in the family, all living in different electorates, it appears that under certain circumstances they can choose to be enrolled in the same electorate as any of their next of kin. That is what it says in the legislation. If those choices do not suit them, they also have the choice of enrolling in the electorate in which they were born. What is even more extraordinary, a prisoner can enrol in the electorate with which they have or feel they have the closest connection. Also, even though it does not say it in the legislation, in practice it works out that they can even enrol in the electorate in which their prison is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A multitude of choices is available to prisoners as to where they may enrol. Why we extend to prisoners this particular privilege that is not extended to anybody else in the community is quite beyond me. No doubt the government supports that position, but I am certainly one who does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just conclude by addressing one other matter; that is, those who refuse or choose not to vote in an election, even though it is compulsory to do so, or those who do not vote for whatever reason, such as they forget. There is a fine of $50 if you do not vote and do not have a legitimate reason for not doing so, such as it being against your religious beliefs. If you do not have a legitimate reason and you do not pay the fine, then you are sent to gaol in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a little draconian in 1995 to be sending people to gaol because, ultimately, they did not want to vote. Surely, it is a right of people to not vote if they feel that strongly about it&mdash;and that is even separate to the argument as to whether or not you should have compulsory voting. I put a question on notice, which has only just been answered today, asking for details of how many people have been gaoled in Australia for not voting in each federal election since 1983. The minister's answer came back to say that they could not answer this because they do not have the records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then asked a separate question, `Will you provide details of each person gaoled for not voting in the 1993 federal general election?' which was the last election. The answer that has come back to me today is interesting. The number of gaol sentences imposed by the courts were one in New South Wales and 11 in South Australia. In addition, another nine people were ordered to perform community service. In Western Australia, the state of the shadow minister who is on duty at the table, there were 34 people gaoled; of those 34, five served part of their sentence, found it too difficult to complete, paid up their $50 and were allowed out of gaol. In the Northern Territory one has been gaoled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these figures have not been finalised as there are still many cases before the court. I also asked the minister, `How many cases that involved not voting in the 1993 federal general election are pending in which a gaol sentence may result?' I received an even more remarkable answer to that. The minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent investigations also reveal that the number of outstanding warrants imposed by the Courts are 496 in New South Wales; 275 in Victoria; 241 in Queensland; 135 in South Australia; 109 in Western Australia; three in Tasmania and 18 in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>So we already have 47 people in gaol in Australia as a result of not voting in the last federal election, and we have a possible 1,277 who could go to gaol. Obviously, it probably will be only a minority of those who will find themselves behind bars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, those statistics go to show how ridiculous this is. The previous speaker, the member for Banks waxed lyrical about murderers and how they should be given the right to vote, for heaven's sake, talking about the rights that people behind bars have. If anybody behind bars has rights it surely should be people who have a very strong conviction that they do not want to vote. But to gaol people in a civilised country in 1995 for not paying their $50 fine surely is absolutely and utterly ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of postal votes, which is dealt with in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, is a matter of very great concern. Every election in North Queensland seems to be held around Christmas time when we get huge downpours of rain creating isolated Aboriginal communities, isolated mining towns, isolated farmers and graziers and isolated railway worker towns. In my own electorate, the ALP thought they were very clever in removing the polling booths at places like Kynuna, Kajabbi, Torrens Creek, and a number of towns of this nature. Of course, all of those towns comprise railway workers, council workers and rural workers; they are the only people who live in those towns. They are only small towns of 20 or 30 voters, and they have had their polling booths removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it rather extraordinary for the ALP to do that. There is enormous ill-feeling and anger being felt by these people at their disenfranchisement. I think the ALP have realised that it is to their detriment, but perhaps I am being very cynical. Perhaps the ALP just felt it was fair to the voting public of Australia, and in particular to the voting public in the large and fairly isolated areas that are represented by people from Western Australia: the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the previous speaker, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), and me.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do thank the government for being a bit sensible on this issue. As to whether it benefits the ALP or us, obviously we could argue the toss backwards and forwards for a long period of time. But most certainly people in these isolated communities reacted with very great anger. After every election in northern Australia, there would be the appearance of a whole string of newspaper articles about people being disenfranchised because of the postal vote system. So we thank the government for that decision, which I understand will be carried in the Senate and brought back here for ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other issue that is involved there, of course, is the time scale. I do not think it is malicious on the part of the postal authorities&mdash;and I know, in fact, it could not have been argued in Queensland because it was when we were in government&mdash;but often times these officials would act with the speed of a snail with a broken leg and, of course, the postal votes would not go out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is a good proposal, and I think the Labor members representing outback areas, like me, would agree that it is a good proposal. Unless the proposal includes a time scale provision for all state governments in Australia, it will still be a fairly meaningless provision, but we most certainly thank the government for a bit of good sense. I am sure that my colleagues from the Northern Territory and from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia would agree with me on those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that a person such as me should get up to speak on a bill on electoral reform without making some mention of the fact that Australia is the only country in the world that viciously discriminates against the people who live in the outback, the far-flung reaches&mdash;or perhaps I should say the geographically isolated parts&mdash;of the country. Whether it is in Russia, Canada or Africa, geographically isolated communities need some sort of special consideration. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking here about the so-called one vote, one value issue which these days in Australia is a dead issue. It is interesting that the first thing the incoming Labor government in Queensland did was to set up a board of review consisting of people who had little `l' liberal sympathies and tended to be thought of as very sympathetic to the socialist point of view, although they were distinguished enough in nature to be respected in their decision making. It was accepted that the board would introduce a one vote, one value system in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the shock and horror of the Queensland Labor government, it did not introduce a one vote, one value system but recommended a weighting for geographically isolated areas. In doing so, it was in step with every other body&mdash;that I know of anyway&mdash;in the world. I cannot think of a single exception to the rule that those very geographically isolated areas be given some special way of protecting their interests, which often are inimical to the interests of the big cities of Australia but because of their geographical isolation are at an enormous disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this situation is not that other countries are more enlightened or more fair-minded than Australia but that the geographically isolated areas have the very bad habit of deciding that they do not really like the central government and attempt to break away&mdash;in many cases, they have successfully broken away&mdash;from the central government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have to tell people in this House about Pakistan or Bangladesh&mdash;or England or Ireland, for that matter. I could give examples from every single part of the world of regions that are geographically isolated from the central government. In Australia, where we have problems of racial mix superimposed upon that geographical isolation, we have a not very healthy situation for the future. Those of you who have been to the Torres Strait would understand very well the sentiments that I am expressing here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about the one vote, one value principle, the first and earliest speculator or father, if you like, of modern democracies, Alex de Tocqueville, comes to mind. He was often referred to as the father of the American democracy. Most certainly, people such as the writers of the American constitution have leaned very heavily upon Alex de Tocqueville's works. A continuous theme reiterated in all of his writings was that democracy should not become simply a tyranny of the majority and that, through one system or another, there should be built into the system protection for geographically isolated communities that would be brutally discriminated against by the interests of the vast majorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am specifically talking about the Brisbanes, Sydneys and Melbournes, and a country where 80 per cent of the members of parliament live within 70 kilometres or 80 kilometres of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide. Heaven help those poor people who are not in the golden quadrangle. They pay a 27 per cent tariff on motor cars, they pay 15 per cent or 20 per cent sales tax&mdash;they are taxed at 50 per cent on their vehicles&mdash;and they pay a 115 per cent tax on their petrol. So they pay a tax of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent when they go to work of a morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne&mdash;60 per cent of whom use commuter transportation systems&mdash;go to work of a morning, their costs are subsidised to the tune of 50 per cent. I give that one small example of the sort of discrimination that takes place when one group of people are almost totally disenfranchised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my father came into this House, his seat of Kennedy consisted of three towns: Charters Towers, Longreach and Mount Isa. That area&mdash;it is slightly bigger now in population than it was then&mdash;encompassed about a third of the electorate of Kennedy, as it now stands. Where those people had a very real control over and a very real communication with their member of parliament, the principal office of the member for Kennedy now effectively has to be put where the demographic centre is&mdash;and the demographic centre of Kennedy now is Innisfail, which, for those of you who do not know your geography, is 30 kilometres from Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To stand up and seriously say that a person who lives in Blackall&mdash;over 2,000 kilometres of road miles away from his member of parliament's office, which is in Innisfail&mdash;has the same value for his vote and representation as someone living in Brisbane, a 15-minute drive away from his member of parliament or a 40c telephone call away, and, I might also add, who invariably is only a 20-minute drive away from the federal and state government decision makers, whether they be the tax, immigration or social security departments, is absolutely ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Great Britain the electorate of the Orkney Isles has 22,000 electors. The East London electorate has 110,000 electors. Nunatsiaq, in Canada, has less than 20,000 electors, yet Quebec has an electorate with over 120,000 electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was sitting at a table one day with a number of members of parliament from the city and they said, `We represent 70,000 people,' and I said, `Speak for yourself, I represent 84,000 people.' They said, `That is not right. Your electorate would be smaller than ours.' I said, `No, my electorate is bigger than yours,' as is Mr Campbell's in Western Australia. In fact, I have the 10th or 11th biggest electorate in population in Australia. Yet members of parliament in Sydney and in Brisbane have 72,000 electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a measure of the vicious discrimination against country people in Australia. Is it any wonder that the people so underrepresented in all of those areas are leaving those areas? They no longer have a secondary education available to them, because the governments in this place and in Brisbane no longer provide them with a secondary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 when we were in government all the costs of going away to boarding school were provided. But these people no longer have that; they no longer have the opportunity for a secondary education. I have heard people in here arguing about tertiary education. But nearly one-fifth of the people in the electorate of Kennedy cannot get a secondary education, never mind a tertiary education. There are very few Third World countries that deprive 400,000 of their people a secondary education. Yet one-fortieth of the Australian population is deprived of a secondary education because the gap between government assistance to go away to boarding school and the cost of going to boarding school is so great that it simply cannot be met even by reasonably well-off people. So a secondary education has been taken away from outback people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, when we go to work every morning it costs us on average 100 per cent in taxes. A lot of my shearers drive 70 or 80 kilometres to get to work in the morning. A lot of my council workers drive 60 or 70 kilometres to get to work. My son, who works in a mine outside Charters Towers, drives 40 kilometres to work, as do the other 400 miners that work at Mount Leyshon, outside of Charters Towers. They get taxed 100 per cent to go to work, yet people in the cities are subsidised to the tune of 50 per cent when they go to work in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vicious discrimination piles on top of vicious discrimination, and people just fall over; the burden is too hard to carry. All of the 23 western shires of Queensland, with the exception of Longreach where the Stockman's Hall of Fame was built, have lost 30 per cent of their population. In fact, most of them have lost over 40 per cent of their population. I recently was working on something for Cloncurry and I found that over the last three years the population drift has increased, has picked up speed. Soon there will be no-one living in any of these areas of Australia. Whereas those areas were once represented by 10 members of parliament, they are now represented by four members of parliament in here. </PARA>

The vast bulk of the constituents will be on the coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In England there are electorates of 22,000 and 110,000 constituents. In Canada there are electorates with under 20,000 constituents and over 120,000 constituents. In the United States, the Senate is a legislature. It can initiate legislation, unlike our august body here. The state of Arizona, with half a million people, has two senators. The state of California, with 30 million people, has two senators. This was built into the constitution by brilliant and gifted men such as Thomas Jefferson, who could see clearly the dangers that were espoused by Alex de Tocqueville when he talked about the tyranny of the majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went before the body that was headed by Mr Sherman in Queensland to talk about distance, I told him that naive and stupid people who do not understand anything about the outback have said to me, `You can use a small aircraft to get around your electorate.' Yes, I can. But to go 2,000 kilometres&mdash;these are air miles, not road miles&mdash;from the other side of Barcaldine up to Mareeba still takes a very long time, even in a light aircraft. Then, of course, you have problems when you get there because you have no car, and the vast bulk of the towns I represent have no hire cars available. There is no way in the world that you can impose upon somebody to borrow a car from them for two or three days because, generous though they are, it would be difficult for them to do that. So, whereas in all of those other countries some allowance has been made for these problems, the only country in the world that has not made an allowance is the most urbanised country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you sow the wind, so you reap the whirlwind.

<PARA>This amendment relates to the critical issue in this debate, which is prisoner disqualification. As the House is aware, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) made a policy decision about the proposal in the bill which we are now, by virtue of this amendment, withdrawing and seeking to replace with another amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had reached agreement on this particular issue with the opposition and other parties. Unfortunately, that agreement has been reneged upon and we are now getting into the usual auction that we see in the community today on who is the toughest on crime. The proposition that the Electoral Commission put forward&mdash;that a crime with a sentence of five years be the appropriate provision&mdash;has now been changed to one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The original provision put in the act so many years ago was put there to make it compulsory for prisoners to vote as part of the rehabilitation process. It was felt in those days that forcing prisoners to face up to their civic responsibility was a good thing and if we believed in the rehabilitation of prisoners and bringing them to heel, so far as their civic responsibility was concerned, it was a good thing for society. That is an opinion which is perhaps not shared as universally now as it was then. We are in an auction of who is the toughest and who has the hairiest chest when it comes to matters of criminality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it a little difficult to speak on this issue, given that I was the minister responsible for the New South Wales Electoral Act for many years, which had a 12-month provision. My motives were purely political at the time. We did a survey of prisoners and discovered that 80 per cent of them wanted to vote Liberal if they had the opportunity. So, for pure political reasons, we were never prepared to amend the act. There are other more altruistic people in the community who wanted to rehabilitate prisoners, so we saw a five-year provision prevailing in most of the country&mdash;in Victoria, the ACT, the Northern Territory and, of course, federally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are other extremes. In South Australia all prisoners vote. That is the one extreme. The real extreme is in Tasmania, where no prisoners vote, no matter what the sentence&mdash;whether it is a day for a parking fine or whatever, you do not vote. That is the hard line. I would have thought that is where we would have ended if I got into an auction today of one year, five years or whatever. We would have ended up with the Tasmanian position. However, that is not the case. The amendment that will be moved later is for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real motive behind the Australian Electoral Commission's suggestions was an endeavour to get some commonsense into what was really an unworkable provision&mdash;a provision that related to the crime rather than the actual sentence given. There are armed murderers in gaols serving only one year. As an ex Attorney-General, I can tell you that there have been murderers who have served only one year in gaol. Other serious criminals have received very light sentences, for one good reason or another, by the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an administrative nightmare to check back to see what the original charges were. Across the country there are many different crimes of the same nature but with very  different provisions and different sorts of penalties attached to them. It was an administrative nightmare for the Electoral Commission. The simple answer was to say, `What was the sentence they actually got, no matter what the nature of the crime?' and work on that. That had some administrative sense. That was the proposal by the AEC, which I eventually supported. That is the position of the government at the moment. I do not think getting into an auction of whether it is one year, two years or five years is the sensible way to behave in this parliament, so the government will be sticking to the five-year provision. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why the opposition finally determined that it would be preferable to have a 12-month exclusion arrangement is that it is consistent with the constitutional bar which applies to members of this House: in the event that they are found guilty of an offence which carries with it a 12-month or longer sentence, they are debarred from the House, which effectively means they lose their seat in parliament. If that was the situation which applied to members of parliament, surely the same principle could be applied in a more uniform manner to demonstrate the fact that it was the belief of the constitutional fathers that persons who committed a crime which carried with it a penalty of 12 months or more were not able to sit in parliament. Surely the principle should apply and they should not be able to vote either. That was the basis on which the decision was made. </PARA>

<PARA>The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 and repeal the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1989 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1989. The Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Bill 1995 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Bill 1995 will replace the repealed licence fee acts. These bills reflect Australia's evolving obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and exemplifies this government's longstanding commitment to the recovery of the earth's stratospheric ozone layer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill will establish the legislative structure to enable Australia to implement effective controls on methyl bromide, HBFC and HCFC similar to those controls under the current legislation on CFC and other ozone depleting substances. The bill also repeals the current licence and quota system from 31 December 1995, consistent with Australia's obligations under the Montreal protocol, to stop the further import or manufacture of CFC, halon, methyl chloroform or carbon tetrachloride. The bill provides for exemptions, where these are permitted under the protocol, for essential uses such as medical dose inhalers and for used ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, when the Ozone Protection Act was originally passed, even the most optimistic forecasters could not have predicted that ozone benign technologies would be developed by industry and accepted by consumers in less than six years. Australia has effectively played its part in the global strategy to save the ozone layer. By the end of 1995 Australia will have phased out the manufacture and importation of CFC, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. This is an enormous achievement, and the government recognises the efforts made by all levels of our society to date. Industry has proved that concerted, cohesive strategies do bear fruit and can succeed in reversing what was described in 1989 as one of the world's worst catastrophes. But more needs to be done if we are to consolidate all the achievements to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 and 1994 the Antarctic ozone `holes' were the biggest and deepest on record. We can expect that ozone destruction will get worse before the reversing effects of the Montreal protocol measures are evident in the stratosphere. The rate of ozone destruction is expected to peak during the next few years, then start to slow down during the early part of the 21st century. Based on these forecasts, and provided international action proceeds as planned, the ozone layer will be at its most damaged around the turn of the century and should recover in about 50 years time. The trends are already good. Atmospheric growth rates in the troposphere of several major ozone-depleting substances have slowed. This is evidence that the Montreal protocol is having its intended effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the scientific background against which recent amendments to the Montreal protocol and the proposed amendments to the Ozone Protection Act must be viewed. The amendments have been prepared in consultation with relevant Commonwealth departments, state and territory environmental agencies, conservation and community organisations and affected industry sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1995 the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, endorsed policies for HCFC controls. It was recognised that HCFCs would need to be used in Australia as temporary substitutes for CFCs&mdash;but only temporarily because these substances still are ozone depleting. As part of Australia's strategy for their phase-out, two different levels of controls were proposed by ANZECC. For controls on HCFC supply and production, Commonwealth legislation was recommended and, for controls on emission and use, state and territory legislation was recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANZECC's decisions followed two years of discussion between representatives of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and industry and conservation groups on the extent and types of controls necessary to meet Australia's needs. These polices followed on from ANZECC's endorsement of the revised strategy for ozone protection, which did not include HCFC or methyl bromide recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills before the House are based on the policies agreed to by ANZECC, industry and conservation groups. State governments have already, or are now, preparing complementary emission controls on HCFC. In summary, the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;provides that all current licences for CFC, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride cease on 31 December 1995;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;establishes a new system of essential use and used substances licences for ongoing uses allowed under the Montreal protocol;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;introduces a new system of controlled substances licences for HCFC and methyl bromide;</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;bans HBFC exportation and manufacture; and</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;establishes a trust fund into which all fees will be paid to support the administration of the act and management programs for HCFCs and methyl bromide. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the current Ozone Protection Act 1989, CFC, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride have each been subject to a licensing system and a progressive phase-out. The phase-out of these substances will be complete at the end of this year. This will have been achieved through unprecedented cooperative efforts by governments, industry and the Australian community and has set a benchmark for collaboration on environmental protection in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments provide that the import, export and manufacture of CFC, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride will be banned as of 1 January 1996, except in the limited circumstances allowed by the Montreal protocol. These exceptions are accommodated under the bill by two types of licences: an essential uses licence and a used substances licence. I will deal with each in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the substances being phased out, the Montreal protocol allows for continued use in a limited number of `essential use' applications. Australian `essential uses' have been approved for the years 1996 and 1997 by the parties to the protocol. This will allow for the continued import of CFCs for metered dose inhalers and substances for laboratory and analytical uses in those years. If CFCs are still required beyond 1997, a further application for `essential uses' will be made to the protocol parties. `Essential use licences' for these uses will be issued subject to strict conditions and in accordance with the protocol guidelines and definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the proposed system of used substances licences, the Montreal protocol distinguishes between new substances and recovered or recycled substances. Ozone depleting substances which have been recycled or reprocessed to the required purity specifications, or which are destined to be so recycled or reprocessed within Australia, may be imported under a used substance licence. This type of licence will also be required for the import or export of waste ozone depleting substances. The used substances licence system will replace the current restricted licence system under the act. The licences will be subject to strict conditions specifying the permitted activity and the circumstances under which it may be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the phase-out of CFC, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride by the end of 1995, the parties to the Montreal protocol agreed in November 1992 to phase out the use of hydrobromofluorocarbons, HBFC, by the end of 1995, to phase out hydrochlorofluorocarbons, HCFC, by the year 2030 and to freeze methyl bromide consumption from January 1995 at 1991 levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable Australia to ratify the 1992 protocol amendments, the Ozone Protection (HCFC, HBFC and Methyl Bromide) Regulations 1993 were made. Under this bill the provisions of these regulations are to be incorporated into the Ozone Protection Act. The regulations enabled controls on methyl bromide imports to commence under the act from 1 January 1995, when controls on methyl bromide came into force internationally. In the case of HCFC and HBFC, controls will come into force internationally on 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation with industry and other interest groups concerning the extent and types of controls necessary to meet Australia's obligations revealed a preference by industry for a more flexible approach, involving a degree of self-regulation, compared with the system which was used for CFC phase-out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry has cooperated with Commonwealth and state environment agencies to set an upper limit for production and importation in Australia which ensures that Australian use of these substances is constrained, while the interim status of HCFCs as substitutes for CFC equipment is recognised. Industry is confident that manufacturing and importation activity will stay under this limit but accepts the need for government involvement if activity exceeds this limit. In contrast with the previous CFC licence and quota scheme, licences will be easier to obtain and transfer and, if government involvement through a quota system is necessary, quotas will be based on licensees' market activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation of HCFCs and methyl bromide will be achieved under the bill by a licensing scheme. A controlled substances licence will be necessary for the importation, export and manufacture of those substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HCFCs are used mainly for refrigeration and airconditioning. They are also used for foam manufacture and as aerosol propellants. In 1992 the Montreal protocol parties agreed to phase out HCFC totally by 2030, with a 90 per cent phase-out being completed by 2015. In 1993 Australia used 2,573 tonnes of HCFC. Australia has one manufacturer and approximately 11 importers of HCFC. The manufacturer has already announced that it intends to close the plant in Sydney by the end of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment bill establishes an initial limit on total consumption of HCFC called the Australian cap which will gradually reduce until the current protocol phase-out in 2030 is achieved. The cap will be made up of an industry limit and a reserve limit. For 1996, these limits will be 250 ozone depleting potential tonnes and 50 ozone depleting potential tonnes respectively. The industry limit is that quantity agreed by industry as being necessary to meet the needs of existing HCFC uses and CFC uses that may convert to HCFC. The reserve limit is an amount set aside for exceptional circumstances to ensure that essential type uses are not jeopardised by an Australian cap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Licences will be issued for a two-year period and will be more easily obtained than under the current CFC scheme which was based on prior activity. The new scheme will control the total amount of HCFC imported or manufactured but will not limit the number of licensees. The CFC scheme, in comparison, limited the total number of licensees but did not limit the amount of CFC that could be imported or manufactured to less than the protocol limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will allow companies wishing to participate in the HCFC market for only a short period the flexibility to enter and leave the market but will not increase the total amount of HCFC being used. Providing industry collectively imports or manufactures less than 90 per cent of the industry limit on HCFC, industry will self-regulate and the quota system will not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, in any year, this 90 per cent limit is exceeded, quotas will be allocated to individual importers and manufacturers. If the 90 per cent limit is exceeded the minister will be required to give notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> advising that from the next HCFC period the HCFC quota system will commence. The notice will establish the base year for quota allocation and the total amount to be issued through the quota system, based on the industry limit as stated for that year in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the quota system is triggered, it will be illegal to import or manufacture HCFC without a licence and a quota. Quotas to individual licensees will be based on the market share of each licensee in the last full calendar year preceding the commencement of the quota period. Licences will be transferable on approval of the minister and quotas will be fully transferable. If a company obtains a licence after the commencement of the first HCFC quota period, it will be up to that company to acquire a quota from existing licensees. Companies in this situation will be advised of this condition prior to any licence being issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry believes that the proposed Australian cap is realistic and adequately caters for increased use of HCFC as temporary substitutes for CFC from 1996 to 1999. To avoid the early retirement of expensive, commercial airconditioning equipment with a long economic life, a small quantity of HCFC quota will, under the current schedule, remain available until 2030. A review of the scheme is proposed for the year 2000 to ensure that the scheme continues to meet Australia's requirements and Australia's obligations under the Montreal protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Methyl bromide is a fumigant used to kill pests and diseases in soil, stored grain and quarantined primary products. In 1992 the Montreal protocol parties agreed to restrict the import and manufacture of methyl bromide to 1991 levels as from 1 January 1995. Under the protocol decision, quarantine and pre-shipment uses are exempted from the freeze. Australia imported 1,200 tonnes in 1994 and, as required by the protocol, has limited its imports for 1995 to 688 tonnes for non-quarantine and pre-shipment purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no single substance which can substitute for methyl bromide, given the wide range of applications for which it is used, but several alternatives are available for certain specific applications. At present no practical substitutes are known for a number of important applications, such as quarantine; however, research into alternatives is proceeding in Australia and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many agricultural sectors will be affected by methyl bromide restrictions. The main impacts are likely to occur in sectors which are required, under plant health standards, to have disease and pest free stock, particularly the strawberry growing industry and flowering bulb industry. These industry sectors and others which may be affected are involved in consultations with the Environment Protection Agency, with a view to each industry sector developing its own strategy for dealing with the management of methyl bromide and any further international controls. The coordination of research, information and training will all be important elements of Australia's overall strategy for reducing methyl bromide use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries which have already controlled or phased out methyl bromide, such as the Netherlands, have found suitable substitutes. The United States has announced a domestic ban on methyl bromide from the year 2001. Those countries that have already phased out claim to have found substitutes without major economic impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulatory scheme proposed for methyl bromide has been kept as straightforward as possible because only two companies expect to continue importing. Under the bill, methyl bromide importation will be continued under a controlled substances licence. A condition of the licence will set a maximum quantity of methyl bromide that can be imported annually by the licence holder. Each importer will be allocated a share of the total amount of methyl bromide that Australia is allowed in a particular year under the Montreal protocol, based on their market activity. The licences will be issued every two years. The scheme allows for the Montreal protocol targets to be reduced if possible, although this is not proposed at this early stage of methyl bromide controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will repeal the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1989 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1989 which will be replaced by the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1995 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1995. The new acts will allow for non-refundable fees to be levied on the activity of licensees, based on the quantity and ozone depletion potential of HCFC imported or manufactured and the amount of methyl bromide imported or manufactured. In addition, an application fee will be required. The fees will recover the costs of administering the licensing systems and fund HCFC and methyl bromide management and industry awareness programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is intended to be cost-neutral to the Commonwealth government. Industry has agreed, based on its experience with the CFC licensing scheme, that the Commonwealth government, through the Environment Protection Agency, has an important information role in assisting owners of equipment with their decision to convert to alternative technologies, equipment and processes which have no impact on stratospheric ozone. Industry has also agreed that the awareness programs should be based on the principle that those companies deriving a benefit from the import or manufacture and use of ozone depleting substances should pay for the cost of programs designed to assist users of those substances to change their practices. Industry representatives have been consulted on the level of fees and have not objected to the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with those principles, industry supports the creation of a trust fund to ensure that revenue collected from licensees at the time of peak activity, between the year 1996 and the year 2000, can be spread and utilised at the times of lower activity between the years 2000 and 2030 when the need for information programs will be most critical if Australia is to minimise the economic impact of the final stages of the phase-out program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initial activity fee levels for HCFC will be set at $2,000 per ozone depleting tonne and for methyl bromide at $900 per tonne. The bases for calculation of fees will be set out in regulations. Importers have no objections to the level of fees. There will also be a two-yearly administration fee for each licence, which will be set at $10,000 per licence period until the year 2000. Fees for essential uses licences will be set at $2,000 per annum and for used substances licences at $10,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been at the forefront of international efforts to mitigate damage already done to the ozone layer and to minimise future damage. The Commonwealth government's approach in building an effective partnership with industry to phase out ozone depleting substances is proving to be an innovative and successful way of meeting the need for ozone protection while containing the effects on the wider community. These bills will ensure that Australia continues not only to meet its international obligations under the Montreal protocol, but also to lead by example in protecting the ozone layer through innovative and effective regulation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the principal act in the three bills before us today include: terminating current licences for CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride on 31 December this year and establishing a new system of essential use licences for manufacture and import of these substances and new substance licences for those substances beyond 1 January next year for limited purposes under the Montreal protocol; establishing an Australian cap for the manufacture, import and export of HCFCs&mdash;hydrochlorofluorocarbons;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and phasing out HCFCs by industry self-regulation under gradual reducing industry limits, reaching zero use by 2030. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also include: establishing controlled substances licences for the manufacture, import and export of HCFCs below the industry limit and activating a two-year HCFC quota allocation period for licensees where 90 per cent, which is the threshold, of the industry limit is exceeded; allocating reserve HCFC quotas to licensees where exceptional circumstances exist; establishing controlled substances licences for methyl bromide; banning the export and import of HBFCs, hydrobromofluorocarbons; establishing a new user-pays licensing and administrative scheme; and establishing an ozone protection trust fund to fund administration and information programs for HCFCs and methyl bromide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add at this stage that the Senate Standing for the Scrutiny of Bills has voiced its concern that each of these bills gives the minister unfettered power to make regulations to set the rate of a fee and is therefore considered to delegate legislative powers inappropriately in that the minister may set a fee so high that it amounts to a tax. The view of the committee is that creating or setting a tax is a matter of primary legislation. I understand the committee has sought the minister's advice regarding these concerns and will meet on Wednesday to discuss these matters further. I will not refer to them again in my speech but I know that they will be raised in the other place at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to talk a little about what this bill is all about&mdash;the ozone layer. The ozone layer is a thin layer in the stratosphere between 15 and 50 kilometres above the earth's surface. It is a natural barrier against ultraviolet radiation from the sun which is harmful to many plants and animals and has been shown to be one of the causes of skin cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thinning of the ozone layer is a result of the chlorine and bromine atoms causing molecules of the ozone to split apart. The UV light in the atmosphere breaks down CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, methyl bromide, hydrobromofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons to release chlorine and bromine radicals which bring about ozone depletion. It is quite incredible the amount of damage that one atom of bromine or chlorine can actually do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CFCs and halons are very stable and persist in the lower atmosphere for over 100 years. One CFC-created chlorine atom can bring about the destruction of thousands of ozone molecules. It is reported that a one per cent decrease in ozone will cause a one per cent increase in UV radiation. The implications of that for this planet are obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1993, 20 million tonnes of CFCs had been released into the atmosphere. CFCs are regarded as the main offenders. HCFCs have a shorter life span and are therefore less damaging to the ozone than CFCs, which is why they have been used as a substitute, but they still damage the ozone. They also need to be phased out at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for the Northern Territory said, methyl bromide is a fumigant used to kill pests and diseases in soils. It is the bromide from this substance that is harming the atmosphere. Bromine is 40 times more efficient in destroying ozone than chlorine. On its positive side, if it has a positive side, it has a much shorter life span in the atmosphere than chlorine&mdash;only a couple of years. However, despite that, bromine is believed to cause substantial loss of ozone because there is a theory that it actually interacts with the chlorine to magnify the effects of the chlorine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first warning that there was a problem came about 20 years ago. That warning was given by the chemists F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario J. Molina. They warned that the chlorine from CFCs could destroy the ozone in the stratosphere and forecasted ozone depletion of between seven and 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, the problem was attributed mostly to the propellant then used in aerosol cans. I think we all remember the controversy at that time. Very early on, the manufacturers of those aerosol cans disputed the findings but very quickly moved to substitute other gases. In fact, it was accomplished so quickly and smoothly that many people did not know it had happened and were still calling for removal of those substances long after they had been removed. CFCs were used not only as propellants but also in refrigeration, insulating foam and solvents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the monthly ozone average&mdash;excuse me for being a bit technical here&mdash;was measured at less than 200 dobson units, the units used to measure ozone by the scientists I referred to earlier. That measurement was 35 per cent lower than the 300 dobson units recorded in 1957-58. At that time, scientists pointed out that these rapid ozone decreases were being closely paralleled by rapid increases in atmospheric concentration of CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 the British Antarctic survey showed that the spectacular decreases in total ozone had been observed over Halley Bay in Antarctica. I think you will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, how surprised everyone was that we had this growing hole in the ozone layer and how concerned we were about the implications for the rest of the world. It was clear that the CFC-ozone problem crossed national boundaries and required international action. A convention was called in Vienna in response to the problem and was held in 1985. Australia was one of the initial parties to the international treaty, known as the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantive provisions of the Vienna convention created a general obligation to protect the ozone layer. Countries party to the convention agreed to take measures to protect human health and the environment from human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Vienna convention failed to contain any specific controls on CFCs or other substances known to deplete the ozone layer. However, the convention had laid the foundation for the adoption of a protocol for a subsequent date. Consequently, the international community negotiated the Montreal protocol of 1987. It aimed to cut back the consumption of CFCs in three stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the convention, five particular CFCs were to be frozen at 1986 levels by 1989, reduced by 20 per cent by 1 July 1993 and reduced by a further 30 per cent by 1 July 1998. Halons were to be frozen at 1986 levels by 1992. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that halons are what are usually used in fire extinguishers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Montreal protocol sought to give developing countries a longer phase-out date. For instance, India and Malaysia still have until 2010 to complete their phase-out. A $290 million fund was set up to assist developing countries. Last year Australia's contribution to that fund was $2.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two major amendments to the Montreal protocol. The first was in London in 1990. Due to the success in reducing the CFCs, the phase-out process was brought forward so that CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115, which were the main offenders, were to be reduced by 50 per cent by 1995 from 1986 levels and reduced by 85 per cent by 1997, with a total phase-out by 2000. I would like to keep these in sequence, but that has subsequently changed again. Halon was to be reduced by 50 per cent by 1995 from 1986 levels, with a total phase-out by 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other CFCs, which had not previously been included, were included in the Montreal protocol. They were to be reduced by 20 per cent by 1993 from 1989 levels and by 85 per cent by 1997, again with a total phase-out by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carbon tetrachloride was brought in for the first time under the London amendment, to be reduced by 85 per cent by 1995 from 1989 levels, again with a total phase-out by the year 2000. Methyl chloroform was to be frozen at 1989 levels and reduced by 30 per cent by 1995 and by 70 per cent by 2000, with a total phase-out by 2005. That shows the progress that has been made in phasing out these substances; and, as new discoveries were made about the harmfulness of other substances, those substances were brought in by the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The London amendments were followed in 1992 by the Copenhagen amendment, which was far more comprehensive. In 1992 the Copenhagen amendment agreed to reduce the original five CFCs by 75 per cent by 1994 from 1986 levels, with a total phase-out not by the year 2000 as in the previous amendment but by 1996, which is next year. That shows the rapid progress that can be made by industry when it sets its mind to doing something. The achievement there has been quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Halon reduction was also advanced, with agreement for a total phase-out by last year, with recycling encouraged. The agreement for reduction in other CFCs was similarly brought forward&mdash;by 20 per cent by 1993 and by 75 per cent by 1994, with a total phase-out by 1996. Similarly, there was agreement to reduce carbon tetrachloride by 85 per cent by 1995, with a total phase-out by 1996, and methyl chloroform by 50 per cent by 1994, with a total phase-out by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons were brought into the amendment. As I said before, they are not as damaging to the ozone as are the hydrofluorocarbons, but they still do damage. Although they were a good interim substitute for those substances, it is important that they also are eventually phased out. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons will be frozen by 1996 and reduced by 35 per cent by 2004, 65 per cent by 2010, 90 per cent by 2015 and 99.5 per cent by 2020, with a total phase-out by 2030. For hydrobromofluorocarbons there will be a total phase-out by 1996 and for methyl bromide a freeze by 1995, with a further study requested on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the original convention in Vienna there was a tremendously rapid change in technology and in industry response to the problem. As I said before, the achievements are quite remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to the hole in the meantime? It is difficult to assess. It certainly has not shrunk, but in 1991 the Pinatubo volcano erupted and the large size of the hole in 1992 and 1993 was attributed to that volcano. Subsequently, there was expected to be a decrease in the size of the hole in 1994, but that did not occur and the hole remains at 23 million square kilometres, which is approximately the same size as Antarctica. There are also break-ups of that ozone hole, and it drifts north into Australia&mdash;which, of course, is a major concern for this country&mdash;and into South America. In the meantime, in the Northern Hemisphere, although there are no holes in the ozone layer, people have been noticing over the Arctic a definite thinning which has caused considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we have reduced the cause of the problem, the problem itself is going to remain for many years to come. I think the best way of putting it is to say that the problem has been resolved but that the results are not as good as we would have liked to have seen. The general consensus, I think, is that we should expect, early next century, to see some improvement in the size of the hole, although I have read some accounts that are less convinced or less optimistic about this. Those people believe we should be taking further action in addition to what has already been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the response has indicated that things can be done when there is a sufficient crisis. Both governments and industries will act together when they believe that there is a crisis and that they need to act. On the other hand, I do think there is some sort of downside in that this has added to the belief that technology can solve all problems. Because CFCs have been phased out and because the CFC content will gradually be lowered, I think there is a belief that if we push things to a crisis we will always find a way of getting around that crisis. I think this is probably not the best way to go, but we should take what has happened with CFCs and the other chlorine and bromine substances as an example of what can be done by industry and governments together when they have the will to do it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an interesting debate, a debate that I have been involved with since 1987. That was the first time I raised this issue in this House. I think it was the first time it was raised in the House. I would like to read from various debates to set the scene for a bit of history on how all this has come about. Back in October 1987 I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic was larger than ever and . . . a reading showed 15 per cent less ozone than the previously recorded minimum in 1985 . . . The scientific community has reached a very unpalatable finding, that this earth is about to be turned into an immense greenhouse which will spawn higher temperatures, increased sea levels and, in terms of biological effect on humans, will mean an increase in the incidence of skin cancer, especially amongst fair-haired and fair-skinned people, and those living above the 40 degree latitude. It will also increase eye disease. Ultraviolet (UV) is known to be a major cause of cataracts and the main concern of blindness among people . . . Laboratory evidence has demonstrated that exposure to UV can harm our immune system making us more susceptible to disease.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carelessness of man means that much of the damage that has already been done to the earth's atmosphere cannot be repaired very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>This is back, as I said, in 1987. About a month later, I asked the then Minister for Science and Small Business, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), a question in relation to CSIRO and the greenhouse effect. This is the last paragraph of Barry Jones's answer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental question is whether this is another factor that we can just leave to the market to work out or whether we need to take some preventive measures to ensure that there is a much higher level of public understanding of what can, potentially, be the greatest environment disaster of all time.</PARA>
<PARA>What Barry was saying there was quite prophetic. In October 1988, I moved this motion in the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">recognises the serious environmental threat posed by the greenhouse effect . . . and that such research should be funded by means of a levy on polluters and pollutants.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The catastrophic effects of any small change in temperature or decrease in the ozone layer could cause huge losses in primary industries and the coastal environment.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is a little bit of history on what happened eight or nine years ago in relation to the ozone layer and what has led up to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke on the first ozone protection bill that was introduced, and I have spoken on all subsequent amending ones. All through that time, I have argued that there should be a pollution tax&mdash;that there should be some sort of levy on people who pollute. One of the best papers I read on this matter was by a professor of economics at the University of Maryland. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic case for pollution taxes is really just a straightforward corollary of the logic underlying a market system. The proper functioning of a system of free markets depends on the emergence of a set of prices that accurately reflect the cost to society of the resources used in the production of goods and services. Prices are the basic signals in a market system that direct the flow of resources to their most productive use. For most goods and services, the market forces of supply and demand generate the proper price.</PARA>
<PARA>To me, that advocates in a way that can justify the imposition of a pollution tax. I still advocate it, and I always will. I think those who use our resources and pollute the environment should pay for the privilege. It should not be the general public who have to pay with increased skin cancers and health problems and a drop in primary production. Those people who actually do the polluting should pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move on from the past to the present, and I would like to inform the House of the progress and some of the things that are happening now in relation to the ozone layer. A relevant article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 17 March 1995 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An international authority on our ozone layer has raised dramatic and immediate new global alarms with evidence pointing to first threats of a north polar ozone hole and worldwide thinning of the ozone shield of 25 per cent within 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In world terms the thinning of northern hemisphere ozone is more ominous than the southern ozone hole, which continues to grow, because the UV radiation shielding ozone layer is at its most stable over the North Pole.</PARA>
<PARA>It then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the ozone layer appeared to be depleting by a few per cent each decade "so after say 50 years there might be a loss of as much as 20 or 25 per cent, and that's getting to be serious".</PARA>
<PARA>Another article, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 4 August 1995 headed `Ozone hole size alarms researchers', states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists who first alerted the world 10 years ago to the loss of ozone above Antarctica have found grim evidence of more destruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of ozone above the South Pole has halved over the past 10 years. The hole is now much deeper and lasts much longer, stretching into Antarctica's summer months of January and February.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Paul Holper, of the CSIRO's division of atmospheric research, said the deepening hole in the ozone layer would have an immediate effect on Antarctica rather than Australia and other countries.

<PARA>I have a pecuniary interest in the CSIRO Atmospheric Division at Aspendale because I am on an advisory board. The work of that organisation is quite outstanding. We should be taking note of the people at CSIRO, not the chemical companies which tell us that everything is fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given honourable members the bad news; let me now give you some good news. Mr Paul Fraser of the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . findings also proved that industry worldwide had switched faster than anticipated to replacements for methyl chloroform, used in metal fabrication and the car industry as a solvent to prepare surfaces for welding, gluing or painting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once industry makes up its mind to embrace a new technology, the rate at which it does so is surprisingly fast.</PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>These are scientists of worldwide renown who are now saying that things are looking a little better in the area of ozone, but we still have problems in the area of greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some suggestions in relation to the ozone. I say that all production of CFCs and HCFCs&mdash;hydroflurocarbons, a CFC substitute&mdash;should cease now; not by the year 2030 as proposed in the bill. We should refuse to allow the import of any of these chemicals right now. We should stand up to the chemical companies which are putting on dinners for MPs to win them over.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often spoken about the greenhouse effect and raised concerns about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australia Remembers program has been an outstanding initiative, and I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for his efforts in making the program a success. It has been a long overdue reaffirmation of the ideals, values and way of life which are the foundations of this country. Nevertheless, in the last decade there has been a tendency to scorn the institutions and values of pre-1960 Australia which fundamentally derive from British heritage. There is no question that in sections of the various arms of government and the media there has arisen a strong undertow of racism determined to denigrate British culture and those of British background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, however, I wish to raise a specific case in which a great injustice has been done and where it appears the department of immigration has humiliated and discriminated against a person who served this country well in the Second World War. I refer to the case of Mr F. J. Marsh. Mr Marsh is an Australian in every sense of the word. For 64 years he thought of himself and was accepted as an Australian. He served this country in the Second World War, receiving decorations for his valour. Yet without warning in 1987, after 64 years, he was stripped of his Australian passport. This happened to a man who, had he been killed in the defence of this country, would have received all the honours of an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Marsh was born in England. He came to Australia in 1923 as an infant with his mother, father, two brothers and sister. The family settled in Cowra. He grew up there and as a teenager enlisted in the RAAF in 1941. Following training in Australia and Canada, he was sent to Europe where he took part in the D Day landings and many other actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1946 Mr Marsh brought his Canadian wife back to Australia but, as she found difficulty in settling in Cowra, they decided to return to Canada for an indefinite period. He continued to visit his family, friends and air force associates over the next 40 years, and his Australian passport was regularly renewed without question. In Canada he was prominent in expatriate affairs and became well known for hosting visiting Australians. He has hosted many functions for groups of ex-servicemen, Australian bands at the Calgary Stampede and the Australian Winter Olympics team. He has also assisted many other Australian sporting teams over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At all times Mr Marsh remained a proud Australian who has never relinquished his identification as an Australian. Yet, in spite of years of appeals to a succession of ministers and departmental bureaucrats for the return of his passport, all he has received is a bureaucratic Orwellian mantra that he is not an Australian and has never been one. It is as if his very persona has to be impersonally destroyed to satisfy the ugly, vengeful anti-British prejudice which now seems to exist among some in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, such a charge will be vehemently denied, but the fact is that there are many ways to amend the relevant acts to return Mr Marsh's passport and those of others in the same position, but there needs to be a will. At no stage has there been any official sympathy or helpfulness. What a hollow mockery the Marsh case makes of the Australia Remembers program&mdash;let alone the statements of the then Prime Minister at the end of the Second World War to the effect that no veteran would be disadvantaged by having served his country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had he not joined the RAAF in 1941, Mr Marsh would certainly have remained in Australia until 1949 and automatically have had his citizenship confirmed. Anyone who served in the defence forces of this country and received a commission in the Citizens Air Force, as Mr Marsh did, does not deserve to be arbitrarily stripped of his citizenship after 64 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fair to say that in recent days there has been a robust debate about bank fees and charges. Sadly, I think the response of the banking industry is to revert to all of their old tricks; it is to categorise advocates of a no-frills bank account as advocates of free banking and to argue there is no need for intervention because they are moving in that direction anyway. Come September 15, the deadline set by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), we will know what progress has been made. But I warn the House that the devil will be in the detail that the banks put forward, and it should be examined very closely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A no-frills account or basic banking product must be one which has access to some over-the-counter services that do not cost an arm and a leg. I warn the banks this evening that no amount of doublespeak will deflect our vigorous representations for a secure, accessible no-frills account, the elements of which I outlined in the House last Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to draw to the attention of the House a group of spineless apologists for the banks; that is, the Liberal and National parties in this House. On 28 April this year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), a frontbench spokesman for the opposition, had this to say about bank fees and charges:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banks should be under no obligation to provide . . . free services to pensioners and other low-income clients . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if this is merely commercial cost recovery, then the banks are simply doing what every other business does . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is quite wrong to expect banks to continue various types of subsidised services if the banks do not wish to.</PARA>
<PARA>But, of course, he is not alone. He is a very senior frontbencher, but he has the backing of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), who recently said in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration that `the antipathy towards the banks on this issue is a considerable overstatement'. He goes on to talk about the experience of his mother, which is very satisfactory&mdash;and I am pleased for him that his mother has very good banking services&mdash;and to complain about an unwarranted attack from members of the Labor Party on that committee. He goes on to argue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would think you had people out there stampeding to the banks to make complaints . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have news for him&mdash;there are people out there stampeding to the banks to make complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach to the banks typifies the economic and social philosophy of the Liberal and National parties. As the PSA report exposed, the less money you have in the bank, the higher your fees and charges; the more money in the bank, the lower your fees and charges. Does that sound familiar? Of course it does. It is the philosophy of Fightback: the lower your income, the higher the tax burden; the higher your income, the lower your tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this particular attitude of the Liberal and National parties is not only there in terms of tax, bank fees and charges; it is there when you look at the wage system. In 14 years the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has supported only two wage increases&mdash;two $8 safety net increases in 14 years. That is only $1.10 per week for every year of the 14 years that he has taken a position on wages. His record on wages and working conditions for average families is simply appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth taking this into account when you consider that the $2 per month fee charged by banks for accounts of less than $500 has been increased in that time and has been brought in in that time. That $2 account fee, which the Liberal and National parties do not oppose and think is very fair, costs an average worker $24 a year. That is $10 more than the $16 worth of wage increases Mr Howard has supported in 14 years. That is the opposition's attitude to Australian workers and it is their attitude to tax. If we had the same level of tax now that John Howard had when he was Treasurer, we would all be paying $550 a year more per man, woman and child. So that is the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really shows through when you look at their industrial relations policy. They do not believe in entitlements such as penalty rates, leave loading, shift allowance and family leave; they would all be abolished under the opposition's policy. Their spokesman, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), is committed to abolishing the no-disadvantage test. What that will simply mean is that, for a typical unskilled labourer who currently works an average amount of overtime, which is 10 hours per week without penalties, the reduction in overtime pay would be $199 per week, or $4,888 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you can see, the attitude of the Liberal and National parties, whether it is bank fees and charges, whether it is taxation or whether it is wages, is to punish the living standards of average workers and of people on low incomes and to give it to the people in this community who do not need it&mdash;the well-to-do and the rich. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last month the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and I shared some public correspondence in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whyalla News</EMPHASIS> over the issue of whether the federal government had supplied the electorate of Grey with access to justice. I had been approached by some organisations in Grey that were concerned about the federal government's cut to funding, in particular, lack of funding for marriage and family counselling in the region. The Attorney-General attempted to assure the electorate that the government's justice package would greatly benefit them. However, many local people disagreed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One case in point in the city of Whyalla, which is in dire need of federal government support for marriage and family counselling services, is the Whyalla Mediation Service, which was established last year. Thirty-one per cent of the cases it dealt with were family relationship issues. The service sought funding this year from the federal government's family services program. However, this was denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whyalla has been excluded from the funding until 1996-97. The service does have community support with funds coming in from the Whyalla City Council, local police and the university. However, it has a funding shortfall of $31,000. This prompted the Whyalla Mediation Service to write to the Attorney-General, expressing its concern over lack of funding for the city. Mr Edward Schuster of the Whyalla Mediation Service stated in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current allocations of funding distribution will effectively mean that Whyalla and Northern regions of South Australia will not receive a `fair and equitable' access to the current division of funding.</PARA>
<PARA>The Whyalla Mediation Service is not alone in its concern over the federal government's commitment to the region. The Port Pirie Central Mission has also written to the Attorney-General. Reverend Bill Harris of the mission stated in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . previous and current justice initiatives have done nothing to address the needs of rural residents in the North of our state.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Port Pirie mediators believe that the present process continues to deny access to justice for people in the country.</PARA>
<PARA>These statements demonstrate the widespread concern in Grey that, despite the rhetoric from the federal government on access to justice, regional and rural South Australia&mdash;namely, the electorate of  Grey&mdash;has been ignored over the years and continues to be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Port Pirie Central Mission has pointed out that a 1994 study reported that South Australia was the `worst serviced state for marriage counselling' and `few Commonwealth funded marriage counselling agencies have operated outside of the metropolitan areas'. This neglect of regional Australia continues under the Keating Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor government has not done a lot for access to justice in Grey before, so some may ask why we should expect them to do anything now. The simple fact is, if the government puts out a document called `Access to Justice', with a fanfare of free publicity about disadvantaged communities and people living in regional and rural Australia, it raises expectations. When those expectations are not met, people are understandably angry and disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in Grey are fed up with the Labor government&mdash;its rhetoric and broken promises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak  about the issue of bank fees and charges and welcome the tough action that has been taken by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on this matter in recent days. In particular, I welcome the Treasurer's clear indication to the banks that, unless they respond in a positive and timely way to the PSA report, reregulation of the banks in this area remains open to him and the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tough action taken by the Treasurer stands in stark contrast to the attitudes of those opposite which were detailed earlier. The various comments by the shadow minister for finance, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), the comments of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, and comments reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday of the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, make it clear that those opposite believe there is no role for government in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been concern about fees and charges for some time&mdash;concern that low income families are being forced out of the system. That concern led to the PSA report. What the Treasurer is now expecting from the banks is a timely and appropriate response to that report. An effective deadline of 15 September has been set for that initial response. I think it is important for the Treasurer, the government and the community to be assiduous in the way in which the attitude and actions of the banks in this matter are monitored and watched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks have a history in this particular matter of slipping the noose at every step in the process. There is a need to ensure that they do not slip the noose on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of other measures that fall for consideration in this area, including: extension of the banking ombudsman's jurisdiction; amendment to the banking code of conduct; and, also, one suggestion that was made in the course of a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration&mdash;the notion of public hearings for either renewal or granting of licences to banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key provisions in the PSA report is found on page 28 of the summary of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the Authority is confident that market processes will deliver appropriate outcomes for consumers. If ready access to RTAs is not maintained in the future, however, it will be necessary for Government to act because ready access is a necessary part of modern day living. Whilst a regulated basic banking product is not necessary today, the option remains one for Government to consider in the future if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the policy road down which the Treasurer is driving. The PSA's comment that `the authority is confident that market processes will deliver appropriate outcomes to consumers' was met, in the first instance, by the Commonwealth Bank announcing increases in a range of fees and charges; two of which stood in stark contrast and were directly opposed to recommendations in the PSA report. Firm action by the Treasurer saw those particular fees reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Commonwealth Bank of Australia needs to proceed very carefully in this matter. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 25 August, was a story entitled `CBA plans new round of fee rises'. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just days after a humiliating public backdown on new fees, the Commonwealth Bank is planning a fresh round of fee increases that will hit hundreds of thousands of customers. . . . CBA is set to impose a 30c fee on electronic transactions that are free of fees, according to an internal bank strategy document.</PARA>
<PARA>A spokeswoman for the bank, Ms Lyndell Deves, is reported as saying that the document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was an element in a group process and nothing in that document necessarily means a decision has been made.</PARA>
<PARA>She also said that internal document would form part of the bank's response to the PSA report. We will be watching that response with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What members of the community should take heed of in this matter is that one should not shoot the messenger. I can understand the frustration of my constituents and of many members of the public when they deal with bank staff on these issues, but they really must address their concerns to management rather than to staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not shooting the messenger is something that the Commonwealth Bank itself should take heed of. My attention has been drawn to a letter distributed to Commonwealth Bank managers on 28 August by John Matthews of the Commonwealth Bank, which refers to information on these matters made public by the FSU New South Wales branch&mdash;information which, of course, the Commonwealth Bank was not particularly happy to have made public. Part of this Commonwealth Bank letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank will cease to deduct Union fees from staff salaries commencing from the pay period due on 7 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an unjustified and pernicious response, an outrageous response, by the Commonwealth Bank in shooting the messenger.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prompted to rise in this adjournment debate following remarks made by a colleague of mine, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), in the grievance debate yesterday where he expressed some concern about the herbicide glyphosate and its impact, as he saw it, on aquatic life. No-one would deny that glyphosate&mdash;as are all other herbicides&mdash;is a hazardous substance, but I think my colleague was rather overstating the case when he suggested that glyphosate was an equally dangerous means of potential destruction as a loaded gun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise in the interests of all agriculturalists and horticulturalists to put the case not only for glyphosate but for herbicide generally because, frankly, without it the practice of primary production in Australia would be dramatically reversed. In my own experience, acres of land that would otherwise have been out of production&mdash;being infested with either Johnson grass or couch grass&mdash;have recovered to be used for successful agricultural production because of the capacity of glyphosate to kill weeds with the characteristics of both Johnson grass and couch grass. The particularly unique characteristic of glyphosate is that it is a relatively harmless chemical. I am not suggesting, sir, that you should rush out tomorrow morning and sprinkle it on your Weeties&mdash;that may be just a shade rash&mdash;but, in terms of its toxicity to human beings, it remains a very safe chemical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is unique about it as a chemical for application in agricultural situations is that the chemical, having passed through the plant and killed the unwanted plant, then latches on to the clay particles in the soil and is held there in perpetuity and does not, in fact, move via the soil into waterways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowan is quite right to express concern about the impact of glyphosate on amphibious life&mdash;I understand and endorse that&mdash;but I would be anxious to point out that the manufacturers of glyphosate chemicals do not suggest that anywhere in Australia it is registered for use as a weed control mechanism where amphibious floating weeds exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made contact today with the Monsanto company, which itself is among the marketers of this particular product. It indicated that the only instances it had had of the product being used for the control of floating amphibious weeds were in the Ord River, where massive doses had been used&mdash;illegally, because it met none of the guidelines outlined by the company in its chemical users handbook. They sent me an information sheet indicating that they had themselves undertaken some tests on the amphibious toxicity of glyphosate and discovered that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the standard testing protocols, glyphosate has been tested for amphibian toxicity in a number of non-standard test species including Rough-shinned newt . . . Tailed frog, and Western red-back salamander . . . The authors found that the LD50s&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the toxic doses&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">were greater than 1000 mg/kg . . . which indicated that glyphosate was practically non-toxic by this route of administration.</PARA>
<PARA>The hazardous area of glyphosate is not in the chemical itself but in the wetters, the surfactants, that accompany it. They are almost like a detergent and are themselves more hazardous than the chemical in the case of glyphosate. As any one of those in agricultural practice anywhere in the House would know, this is a chemical that has played a key role in the rehabilitation not only of horticultural crops but also of many pastoral species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply stand to put the case for what is an essential agricultural chemical and to point out to the House that it would be rash to suggest that the chemical ought in any way to be banned. Frankly, I suspect it is much more likely to be abused in the urban situation than it is in the rural situation. There would be, no doubt, a number of instances of urban chemical users who are much too generous in the application of glyphosate for weedkilling simply because they say, `If a teaspoon will do it, why don't I add two teaspoons?' whereas in the case of agricultural users, you can be sure that those who are putting this relatively expensive chemical into a spray vat at the rate of, say, nine litres per vat are not about to double it to 18 litres, in the interests of their own efficiency and in the interests, in fact, of our own economic recovery. </PARA>

The project I refer to is the project Bushranger, the army's project, involving the construction and manufacture of 500 armoured personnel carriers for the Australian Army. It involves about $360 million plus.</PARA></TALK.START>

The companies that have been listed are Australian National Industries, British Aerospace Australia, Westrac Equipment Pty Ltd, Transfield Defence System and Perry Engineering. However, there were a large number of firms which were interested in reaching the final process. Australian Defence Industries, unfortunately, missed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, being still 100 per cent owned by the Commonwealth government, the Commonwealth government would have seen Australian Defence Industries advance to at least the final consideration stages, bearing in mind that their expertise is acknowledged worldwide in defence contracts and they have probably the most highly respected heavy engineering organisation in Australia, with top class engineering facilities and expertise. Also, they have been one of the leading movements and one of the leading proponents of ordnance equipment and manufacturing and have done work for the submarine project and for the Australian frigate project. Their ability in this field is recognised worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it would have been a great opportunity for the Keating government to show its commitment to Australian Defence Industries and to the city of Bendigo and its population. It is an opportunity to put that plant on an economic basis by considering them for a contract like this. ADI had proposed to build a new multimillion dollar factory in Bendigo to make these armoured vehicles in conjunction with the existing fine plant that they have there. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, would probably be aware of Australian Defence Industries. He may even have visited that organisation since its reorganisation, when all of the heavy engineering was consolidated from Maribyrnong in Melbourne to Bendigo to take advantage of this type of tender, because the government and the army were looking for people to be successful and to provide competitive tenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that ADI put in a tremendous amount of work in preparing a submission. I went to a briefing on that. To say that I am distressed is an understatement. The fact that they have not been considered in the final five to even advance to that stage and to have the opportunity to continue discussions in the tendering process on what they might be able to do I find quite astounding, especially considering that the government owns 100 per cent of this industry. I note the minister at the table acknowledging what I have said. I trust that he will speak to his colleagues in the government. I believe this reflects very badly on the government when they own this high class engineering facility which has demonstrated its capacity and capability to perform defence contracts at an extremely high level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, imports of pig meat from Canada (on a bone-out basis) for the ten months from July 1994 to April 1995 (inclusive) were 36 per cent greater than for the period from July 1993 to April 1994, based on data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The total level of imports for 1994-95 is 4,451 tonnes which is less than the previous highest level of 5,097 tonnes in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It has been claimed that imports of Canadian pig meat are having a price depressing effect on the market. The industry previously applied for dumping and countervailing duties on exports of frozen pork from Canada in 1992 and were unsuccessful. At a meeting on 28 June 1995 I made an offer to the pig industry that the issue be investigated by the Industry Commission (IC). On 1 August 1995 I announced that the Terms of Reference for that study had been finalised with the industry, and that the IC are to report by the end of October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As part of the study referred to in part (2), the impact of Canadian subsidies on the price of Canadian product in Australia will be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government certainly does advocate a level playing field for Australian pig meat producers, and has been working to remove both international import barriers to trade and trade distorting subsidies that may impact on producers' viability. We also acknowledge that the Canadian Government has been reducing support to primary industry in line with GATT Uruguay Round commitments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> did not specify particular targets for individual programs in 1994-95 and the forward years.

As a result, there will be fewer clients in the target group and the Working Nation objectives can be achieved with fewer labour market program commencements.</PARA>
