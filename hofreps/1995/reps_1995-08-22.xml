<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I wish to advise the House that on 28 July the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) raised with me as a matter of privilege actions of the Australian Federal Police in searching his electorate office on 26 July. Under standing order 97A, members are able to bring to the attention of the Speaker matters of privilege arising during the long adjournment periods. The Speaker is able to refer such matters to the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges, provided that such referrals are reported by the Speaker at the next sitting. If the House endorses such a referral, the reference to the committee stands and the inquiry proceeds. If, of course, a referral is not supported, the Committee of Privileges can take no further action on such a matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the opposition do not oppose the motion before the House, we do believe firmly that it is merely tinkering at the edges. Fundamental reform is necessary in order to improve the workings of this place, but the government continually ignores that fact. The first and foremost problem relates to the rostering system for ministers, which at present sees ministers coming into this House and being held accountable for their actions as the elected representatives of the people of Australia a mere two times a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that, unambiguously, it is a device by the government to shield ministers who are in trouble. And we are going to get a classic example this parliamentary week when the embattled, besieged Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) appears for questioning just once. We will have one opportunity only to ask her how she can justify spending huge amounts of taxpayers' funds&mdash;at least $10,000 a day&mdash;in a phoney defence of some concocted legal principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is utterly unacceptable to the opposition and to the people at large that ministers be hidden from questioning in this way. It always amuses us when occasionally we see background briefings in newspapers from members of the government's backbench expressing the wish that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) be in here every day and that some of them have approached him saying, `You are our best parliamentary and electoral weapon and you should be in here every day to do over the opposition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister thought there was an electoral advantage in it, he would be in here. He will do anything for an electoral advantage. The reason he is not in here every day for questioning by the opposition is that he knows he has more to lose. In other words, he is afraid of daily questioning by the opposition. There is no other explanation for the Prime Minister's absence. He is, in fact, a coward in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cowardliness of the Prime Minister and his ministers has caused the institution of the parliament to suffer. This place has far less relevance than it had before the Prime Minister corrupted its procedures in the way he has through the roster system&mdash;and that is a very bad thing. It is one thing for the Prime Minister to make the major government announcements outside of the parliament and to ignore it in all of the principal policy statements and questioning. But it is another thing to choose places like the National Press Club, as he will this Thursday, to face up to questioning by unelected representatives of the media but not by the opposition. He has downgraded the importance of the elected legislature in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will restore the pre-eminence of the parliament in the democracy of Australia. We will have our Prime Minister Howard and the ministers in here to face any questioning the opposition may want to put up. So the motion before the House is merely procedural; it does not go to the heart of the failings of the workings of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, we will ensure an independent Speaker. We will wish to preserve the independence of the Speaker by adopting the Westminster system whereby the Speaker, once chosen, is not challenged for either preselection or by candidates from other parties&mdash;they quit the party. So we are anxious that this parliament be seen to operate fairly and the rules apply impartially to all of the participants, unlike the hectoring and bullying you get from the government members, not least of all from the person who occupies that chair&mdash;the Prime Minister himself. We worry on your part. We worry for your sake.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I only rise on one point, because we have heard the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) about 500 times before. There is something new in it. This is the first time I have heard such an explanation&mdash;and it is a very original explanation&mdash;for the sacking of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) by his Liberal Party division. The sacking of the member for Curtin is to create the possibility for him, should the coalition secure office, to be an independent Speaker. This is the first time I have heard that interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It outweighs the interpretation that we have all heard in the media to this point in time that the gormlessness of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), his unwillingness to come to the aid of his strongest supporters in Western Australia, his willingness to see them sacked from their endorsements&mdash;and that also applies to one or two of his mates in New South Wales&mdash;is to create the possibility of there being a series of Independents in the place so that, should the coalition get elected to office, they would have somebody to choose from so they could say they had an independent Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>On 19 April 1995 the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v. The Queen. By a majority of six to one the court decided that, where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in such conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that is now before the House responds to that judgment. The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty. The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people, both in the chamber and in the community, might ask: why should we sanction the police participating in criminal activity? Won't this activity lead to the entrapment of people?  Won't it be an inducement for the committing of crimes that would otherwise not occur? They might say that there are many dangers in sanctioning these covert operations. I will respond to each of these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drug crime is peculiarly difficult to combat. Rarely are there complainants about this conduct. The importation of large quantities of drugs is a clandestine criminal activity  involving complicity, or participants who will remain silent for fear of retribution. Organised crime does not tolerate complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values of equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally, however, there is the right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption it can spawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. It must be borne in mind that loss of confidence in law enforcement will lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. This is not such a bill. The choice before us is between a society prepared to accept balanced legislation to counter criminals, and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill lays down a full and open system of accountability. The bill requires that the responsible minister, at present myself, is kept informed of all applications for the authority to conduct a controlled operation. In turn, the responsible minister is required to table a report in parliament providing details of the applications made under the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure will not lead to `entrapment' of people. A controlled operation may be conducted only in circumstances where the targets of the operation are likely to import&mdash;or export&mdash;narcotics whether or not the operation takes place. The bill will ensure that it will not be permissible for officers to procure the commission of offences which otherwise would not have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law as regards accepting or rejecting evidence obtained by improper methods will be maintained. However, controlled operations may lead to the detection of principals whose activities might otherwise never be discovered, let alone prosecuted. I should emphasise that controlled operations are an internationally accepted investigatory technique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 February 1993 the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances came into force in Australia. That convention was implemented by legislation that commenced operation that same day. Article 11(1) of the convention provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 11&mdash;Controlled delivery</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. If permitted by the basic principles of their respective domestic legal systems, the parties shall take the necessary measures, within their possibilities, to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, and to taking legal action against them.</PARA>
<PARA>This article indicates the recognition by the international community of the need to employ specialised investigative techniques, like the controlled operation, to deal with organised and sophisticated traffickers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct&mdash;commonly known as the FitzGerald report&mdash;also discussed the use of new techniques in combating organised crime. Commissioner FitzGerald concluded that an effective response to organised crime is dependent upon recognition of four factors: the social changes which crime causes and the fact that it diminishes the quality of life;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the fact that crime escalates if it is not controlled;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">recognition that there are vulnerabilities in the social order which expose it to exploitation; and the steps that are needed to control crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the latter point&mdash;the steps that are needed to control crime&mdash;Commissioner FitzGerald stated that consideration should be given to a wide range of measures which would equip law enforcement agencies with new powers including permitting `the infiltration of criminal groups'. Commissioner FitzGerald concluded that orthodox policing is quite unable to enforce the law. This bill will ensure that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies have available to them the controlled operation as a tool in the investigation of the trade in narcotics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that, because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable members may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence. How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be `an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that `in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen.' The enactment of the bill now before the House will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, the trigger for the exclusion of evidence will not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importation, or exportation, of the prohibited narcotics. This will ensure that the importation or exportation itself is not made lawful, thereby exonerating the targets of the operation who planned the conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to describe the effect of the bill upon prosecutions that are current at the time the bill commences operation. There are a number of investigations that are affected by the decision in Ridgeway. They all involve very significant participation in trafficking in narcotics; for example:</PARA>

These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. They were not operations involving out of control cowboys riding roughshod over our laws. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a ministerial agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State, having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police, Senator the Honourable Michael Tate, and the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service, Senator the Honourable John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA>Once that agreement was obtained the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines. These guidelines run to 50 paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants. </PARA>

Each of the accused alleged to have been detected as a result of these controlled operations is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is not opposed to the intent of the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995. We are concerned about aspects of detail. We think some of the details in this legislation need to be considered by a parliamentary committee&mdash;preferably the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I foreshadow that there are some matters of detail that, given such an examination and review, we regard as having significant defects and we will press upon the government some amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say before I proceed to examine the detailed provisions of this bill that the opposition is not opposed to the purpose of the bill outlined by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the Mr Bigs, not just apprehend couriers and the dealers on our street corners. Indeed the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them, and their children who are particularly vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not opposed to endeavouring to catch those criminals who want to exploit vulnerable young people to make large sums of money. The minister in this speech, as he has done on other occasions when he has written on these matters, wants it understood that there is a need for some balance in these matters. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values such as equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally however there is a right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption that it can spawn.</PARA>
<PARA>In those comments he was indicating that there are some difficult questions of balance that need to be addressed. One ought not to assume, in trying to address this evil, that the government has achieved the correct balance. I hope by my comments that those points will be understood and that there will be no attempt to suggest that we lack concern to address the evil that this bill purports to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with legislation that arose from the High Court case of Ridgeway v. R in 1995. The court held that where the Federal Police break the law by committing an element of the offence for which the defendant was being prosecuted then the court should exercise its discretion to refuse to allow evidence against the defendant to be admitted against him in that instance. Ridgeway was entitled, as a result of the court's decision in that matter, to a permanent stay of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the court were deeply concerned with the illegal conduct of those who uphold the law and the effect that has on the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system. They held that if law enforcement officers were to be exempted from this law then it would be an issue for the parliament and not the courts. I will quote from the decision of Sir Anthony Mason; our Governor-General designate, Sir William Deane; and Mr Justice Dawson in this case. It was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effective investigation by the police of some types of criminal activity may necessarily involve subterfuge, deceit and the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission by a suspect of a criminal offence. When those tactics do not involve illegal conduct, their use will ordinarily be legitimate notwithstanding that they are conducive to the commission of a criminal offence by a person believed to be engaged in criminal activity . . . A finding that law enforcement officers have engaged in such clearly improper conduct will not, of course, suffice of itself to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences or of an element of it. As with the case of illegal conduct, the discretion will only arise if the conduct has procured the commission of the offence with which the accused is charged.</PARA>
<PARA>The court was not being prudish about these matters. The court recognised that there needs to be some creativeness in the way in which the investigatory authorities undertake criminal investigations and also, as it said, some subterfuge, deceit and intentional creation of opportunities for the commission of a criminal offence by a suspect. But it was when the police or Commonwealth authorities might be party to the commission of an offence that they put it in a different context and came to the decision with which we are dealing now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice McHugh dissented on the basis that the defendant in this instance had not been induced to commit the offence. That appears to be the case, and it is an important part of this legislation that the police or Commonwealth authorities should not be involved in inducing people to commit an offence which they would not otherwise commit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is seen as a response to the court's decision where the court invited the parliament to deal with this matter further, if it considered the matter warranted it. The bill seeks to ensure that, as a result of the Ridgeway case, the evidence of a controlled operation will not be rendered inadmissible in a court. We understand that, after the handing down of the particular decision, the South Australian parliament has passed similar legislation to that which is proposed here and that there is similar legislation in place in Victoria and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objects of this bill, we are told, are, first, to exempt law enforcement officers from criminal liability for conduct in the course of a controlled operation involving importation, export or possession of narcotics which has been authorised by the act; and, second, to require the Commissioner of the Federal Police and the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority to report to the Minister for Justice on all requests to authorise controlled operations and for the minister to report these matters to parliament, as outlined in the bill. The third object that is addressed is to provide that evidence of importation of narcotics, obtained from an operation before the commencement of the amendments in which the Federal Police and Customs officers cooperated to allow narcotics to pass through a Customs barrier, is not to be rejected on the basis of the unlawful conduct of officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does this through amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 by adding additional definitions, such as a definition of what is a `controlled operation', `narcotic goods', `narcotic goods offence', and by the insertion of a proposed part 1AB entitled `Controlled operations for obtaining evidence about certain offences relating to narcotic goods'. Proposed section 15G details the objects of the new part. Proposed section 15H defines a `controlled operation' as an operation that must have three elements: first, certain persons; secondly, acting for certain purposes; and, thirdly, being likely to engage in conduct that constitutes an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act or an associated offence, except for this bill. The second matter it deals with is an operation involving the participation of defined law enforcement officers who are engaging in conduct which would, apart from this part, constitute a narcotic goods offence. The third point is that the operation must be for the purposes of gathering evidence of the importation, export of narcotic goods or associated offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 151 is the key provision of the bill. It provides that a law enforcement officer will not be criminally liable for conduct that is, first, carried out in the course of duty; secondly, for the purposes of a controlled operation; and, thirdly, at a time at which a certificate is issued under the act authorising the operation. The officer is not prevented from being civilly liable or criminally liable for other conduct such as theft, bribery or assault even if committed during such an operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed sections 15J, K, L, M, N, O and P deal with the following matters respectively. The first relates to a law enforcement officer's application for a certificate for authorisation of a controlled operation. The second is the form and contents of the application&mdash;that is, it has to be in writing stating whether a previous application has been made in relation to the operation and whether it was refused or granted, and other relevant information. The third matter relates to the urgent applications where a certificate is needed quickly to have effective law enforcement value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue relates to the grounds on which a certificate authorising the operation may be given&mdash;the authorising officer is satisfied that all information about the nature and quality of the narcotics has been given, the criminal activity would have taken place without the involvement of the law enforcement officers, the operation has a genuine law enforcement purpose, and that any narcotics in Australia at the end of the operation will be in the control of an Australian law enforcement officer. The fifth matter is the form and content of the certificate authorising the controlled operation. The sixth is the surrender of the certificate where the operation has been aborted or completed. The seventh relates to the period for which the certificate is in force&mdash;that is, it ceases on the 30th day after issue unless a shorter period is specified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 15Q provides that the Comptroller-General of Customs must be notified in certain circumstances so he is aware of the narcotics passing through the Customs barrier. Proposed section 15P provides that the Minister for Justice must be notified as soon as possible of all grants and refusals for a certificate and the reasons for that decision. This information must then be tabled in the parliament yearly by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters that are of concern to the opposition in relation to this bill. The first issue I want to raise is that of retrospectivity. Future prosecutions will be covered by this bill by retrospectively authorising conduct which has been undertaken in the past. It does not create new offences in relation to individuals, but certain prosecutions that would otherwise fail are being retrospectively ensured of likely success by the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there are 10 possible individuals who may face significant charges: three of them for offences which carry penalties with a maximum of 25 years imprisonment and the other seven for offences which carry penalties with a maximum of life imprisonment. The government claims that the prosecution of those people is in jeopardy if the bill is not passed as the evidence may be inadmissible under the Ridgeway decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, on the basis of natural justice, does have a general reluctance to support retrospective legislation especially in relation to criminal law. I want to quote one of my colleagues who will speak later in this debate about our position on this matter. It was well stated by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) when, in dealing with certain customs legislation before this parliament in June, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fundamental principle of our legal system that laws are made to have prospective operation and not retrospective operation. It is simply unjust and oppressive to subject citizens to a law they have no means of ascertaining simply because the law has not been conceived, drafted, debated or enacted.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable for the government to assert, as it does in the explanatory memorandum, that the law will have effect as if for the last nine years it had meant what, in the opinion of the author of the explanatory memorandum, a so-called `ordinary' person would have thought it meant. Under our legal system, laws mean what parliament intended them to mean. The task of deciding what parliament intended a particular law to mean, when there is any doubt about it, is entrusted to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our system is a democracy subject to the rule of law. If the government cannot draft its legislation properly, it must redraft it and go forward from there. This attempt to rewrite history is outrageous and should be resisted.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to us that this issue of retrospectivity needs to be addressed. This is criminal legislation and we ought to hear further from the government about the extent to which this legislation should be proceeded with. You have to weigh up the principles that are involved against the evil that the government says may occur if this legislation is not implemented retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to deal with is accountability mechanisms and judicial oversights. One of the major concerns that we have with this particular legislation has been raised by a number of organisations, including the Lawyers Reform Association and the new Ridgeway Coalition&mdash;a group of interested specialist legal practitioners representing the criminal law committees of the New South Wales Law Society, New South Wales Young Lawyers, the Law Council of Australia and representatives of the Criminal Bar Association, the New South Wales Public Defenders, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the New South Wales Society of Labor Lawyers, the Lawyers Reform Association and the Australian Chapter of the International Commission of Jurists. I am sure that if the minister were in the House he would recognise the very considerable reputation of all those organisations which have joined together to make submissions on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that senior police officers may authorise the commission of a serious offence without the safeguards of judicial oversight. There is no independent mechanism by which these decisions will be oversighted under the legislation that is proposed by the government. I will, in due course, put before the parliament some of the reasoning of the minister in pressing this particular matter. The Ridgeway Coalition has suggested to the minister that certificates be issued by the Federal Court on sworn application only. This is in line with the circumstances in which other unusual conduct by police is authorised, and that is the issue of warrants for telephone interceptions which can cover a range of offences, some being quite significant, some being relatively minor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in relation to telecommunications interception laws there was an attempt to balance competing interests, namely privacy and freedom of speech on the one hand and law enforcement requirements on the other. The sorts of offences involved were murder, kidnapping, certain narcotics offences and offences which are subject to special investigation by the National Crime Authority. The second range of offences are punishable by seven years imprisonment or more and involve the loss of life or serious personal injury, trafficking in narcotic goods, serious fraud and other offences. It can be seen in relation to telecommunications offences that some of them are significantly less serious crimes than we are speaking of in relation to these controlled operations. That is the point that needs to be understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Justice was asked to address this matter he tried to suggest that authorisations here were quite different from the sorts of authorisations that are required in relation to telecommunications interceptions. I want to quote from his letter to Mr Mauri Stack, the President of the Law Society of New South Wales. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances in which a judge or magistrate is required to act as a decision maker are those in which law enforcement objectives must be balanced against the need to protect against unreasonable invasion of civil liberties, for example, in seeking to search, arrest or telecommunications interception warrants. A controlled operation does not involve any such invasion. The decision-making criteria are operational, relating to the likely effectiveness and security of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA>What interested me was that the minister, in his own letter and in his speech today, recognised that we are again balancing difficult issues. In the concluding paragraph of his own letter to Mr Stack, Minister Kerr said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is always a difficult task to balance the need to allow the effective investigation and prosecution of those who break the law, against the need to maintain the civil rights of citizens, and to prevent corruption and abuse of powers by police.</PARA>
<PARA>Another factor that might well be entertained there is the need to preserve public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the authorisation issue, I think the minister has set up a straw man to say that this matter ought to be left in the hands of the police because they are operational issues that are being addressed. Clearly in relation to this legislation we are looking at the balancing of very important issues: the need for effective investigation and prosecution of those who break the law against the need to maintain the civil rights of citizens, to prevent corruption and abuse of powers, and to preserve public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system. Who better to do that but the courts, as was seen as appropriate in other legislation? It seems to me that these are proper issues to be investigated in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authorisation of the breach of laws does provide enormous potential for abuse. There is a strong argument to increase the accountability provisions to prevent this. This may be done by extending the information concerning the controlled operation to be provided to parliament. The bill currently provides that the minister is required to report annually on the details of an application made for certificates but that there is no requirement to report the outcomes of controlled operations. We ask additionally: are the requirements to supply information to enable a decision whether or not to grant a certificate adequate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, consideration is given to whether alternative methods of investigation are capable of providing suitable evidence for the charges to be laid. With the offences of conspiracy, an attempt may be prosecuted instead. Further, maybe the seeker of certificates should be required to demonstrate the gravity of the offence, and this should be taken into account when deciding whether or not to issue a certificate. These are matters, properly, that a committee might want to review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the opposition and lawyers that are concerned about this, although it may be said that the person I am going to quote from is in fact a lawyer. I noticed that a letter was reported to have been written to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker). He is a former attorney himself; he is a lawyer&mdash;I think I studied with him at the Sydney law school. In a letter dated 26 June, which I have not seen denied anywhere, Minister Walker wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we are in a political climate of competition to see which party can lay the most waste to civil liberties and the rule of law, and I know that ministers shouldn't interfere in their colleagues' portfolios. However, I cannot in conscience help but join the vociferous protest from the Australian legal profession at your proposed response to the Ridgeway decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside the police state nature of the amendments, I would respectfully suggest they are guaranteed to founder in the High Court, leaving the government with egg on its face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To exempt the police from liability under the general criminal law for heinous crimes involving up to life sentences, simply because the officers were `acting in good faith in the course of duty', is an abomination and invites a ruling by the High Court that it is an excess of executive power.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One has only to read the daily reports of abuse of police power and corruption coming out of the NSW Royal Commission to know that it is laughable to give police officers exclusive powers to authorise `controlled operations' and to grant them immunity from their crimes.</PARA>
<PARA>Might I say in a personal way that since the minister wrote this there have been many more developments in New South Wales which would give those who are concerned about these matters even greater cause for concern. The minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a step equates with the National Crime Authority's granting of immunity from perjury to their super grasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the root of all police corruption has been this view that they are immune from the law. This provision will do nothing to improve that problem. The potential for corruption is virtually unlimited. The provisions [also] seem to invite attack on constitutional grounds raised in Millosevic v Campbell, Leeth v the Commonwealth, Polyvkovich v DPP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retrospective immunity for drug dealing offences is yet another outrage in the bill. Again it raises serious constitutional problems.

<PARA>I think there is a real concern in the community about these matters, and the minister has articulated some of that. There needs to be a balance reached between limiting the powers of the Federal Police&mdash;and hence jeopardising the prospects of bringing drug traffickers to justice&mdash;and community concern about the growing problem of drugs, and whether the police should be involved in organising the commission of a crime, the argument that controlled operations may be encouraging crime due to the facilitation by law enforcement bodies of a controlled delivery, the argument that there are other crimes the person may be convicted of and the civil libertarian concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that Australia is committed to the reduction of drug trafficking. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 does place an obligation on Australia to act against the illicit traffic in drugs. We noted Article 11 that the minister quoted from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that this bill is required urgently on the basis that there are a number of cases which are in jeopardy, as at the moment the evidence is probably not admissible as a result of this particular High Court case. I ought to conclude by saying that if it is the government's view that this bill is likely to be necessary to ensure that it is successful in other prosecutions about which it is genuinely concerned then the government itself ought to propose the reference of this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is more likely that that committee will have time to devote to consideration of the detail of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only tell the government that if my amendment, which I will propose in the event that the government does not propose that reference, is lost in this chamber today then the bill will of course be the subject of such a reference in the Senate. Given the comments I have seen from some senators from minor parties, I am sure such a reference would be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Senate committee has a much heavier workload and the Senate itself has a very heavy workload. It is more likely that the legislation would be delayed by the government persisting in that approach. So I would encourage the member and the minister's advisers to counsel the minister to agree to this reference. I think it would be to the advantage of those who want to ensure successful passage of this legislation, albeit in an amended form, for the government to cooperate with that committee hearing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first entry into the law was as an adjunct to business. The next was in this parliament when I became a member of this government's policy committee on legal and administrative affairs. I must pay tribute to my former colleague the late Senator Olive Zakharov, who stayed on that committee for the duration of her time in parliament. That showed extraordinary patience because she was not a legal eagle, she wasn't a lawyer, but she felt that someone from the laity ought to be on that committee and stay on it. I give her full credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to enter into the making of laws, and the examining and altering of them, with the philosophy that laws are expedients. They can falter or be altered; they can be bolstered or abandoned. That has been happening through human history and recognises that the laws are not always relevant to a society and often have to change. Quite often, when they are changed, they are changed wrongly. I believe that is the case with the total prohibition of some drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of money, time, worry and legislation and a great number of court hearings, gaolings, bashings and thefts could be avoided if we had examined the history of drug laws, particularly over the last 40 or 50 years. Certainly what the legislation tries to do is not all that unusual. It is not a lot different from making certain laws where certain people have to comply with requirements that others do not have to comply with or certain people are permitted not to comply with requirements that others do have to comply with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, when I was in pharmacy many years ago in Victoria, pharmacists were not allowed to see people in private consultation. Other people were permitted to see people in private consultation&mdash;even the laity could do so. A person could call themselves what is now called a naturopath&mdash;people used to call them quack doctors. They could see people in private consultation, but a pharmacist at that time could not have a room for seeing a person in private consultation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra has mentioned the fact that telephone interceptions are made. Certain people are permitted to intercept conversations on the telephone. The honourable member disputed that this could be serious. He said these are less serious operations. That is wrong because telephone interceptions are often used to detect the drug barons, the people who are breaking the laws in relation to drugs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that there are a number of possible problems with the application of this legislation. One is accountability.

One of the matters which have come out in some royal commissions and the Winchester inquiry is that police may be involved in something which means that some drugs may not be secure. Then there is the risk to police and other people. There is the cost of the operations as well. The member for Berowra said there is a possibility that the legislation that we pass could be rejected by the courts. I am not so sure of that.

You have enormous costs going into the billions in that cash economy alone as money is lost from taxation to people who are involved.

The medical practitioner prescribed oral heroin; the pharmacist dispensed sometimes linctus heroin. When the item was dispensed the patient was told very often by their doctor, `Don't come back for another week. I'm not going to give you any more.' The patient did just that. A high proportion of the people who were addicted to heroin and other drugs such as chloral hydrate, cocaine and even betel nut were under some degree of control by their doctor. The doctor acknowledged their addiction. The pharmacist knew of their addiction. The legal authorities tended to overlook the addiction. It was illegal to be an addict, but people tended to go along with it if the addicted person was under some control. The person would not break into a pharmacy. </PARA>

It was no different. No-one ever came in and robbed it. But after the laws were changed&mdash;after the use of heroin, cocaine and amphetamines became illegal&mdash;suddenly we had to put safes in our floors and bars on our windows. We had to try to protect ourselves from people who attacked and robbed us and people who robbed others so that they could illegally buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drug laws have a chequered history in this country, with some products being legal in one state and not legal in another. For that reason, I have sought a review of drugs laws as they exist in Australia. One thing that is very evident&mdash;one might call it the clinical evidence&mdash;is this: the problems that exist now did not confront us 40, 50 or 60 years ago or even hundreds of years before that because one could obtain these drugs under varying degrees of control. </PARA>

There were moves by the United States through the United Nations. What have we done? We have made them worse.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even now, people will say that people are different now. They are not really all that different.

Organised crime has found an avenue by which to make money through dealing with something illegal. </PARA>

That is all I have to pay, so I would rather that you write me the prescription. I will go on the computer and continue to get the drug. I agree to talk about rehabilitation and that sort of thing. That is what I will do. I am prepared to take the drug under control. It is a drug that is pure, properly dosed and properly administered. I am prepared to do that if I can get the drug a lot cheaper.' It would not be worth organised crime maintaining the current structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we look at history. I am amazed that people have not been combining. For instance, in pharmacy, the reformers are combining with the conservatives. I regard as a conservative an old pharmacist friend of mine from the Bega area who has operated as far back as I have. I hope that he does not mind being described as a conservative. He applauds the idea of going back to the situation as it existed then, because he is sick and tired of the situation as it exists now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why we want police power to combat drugs. I agree with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) that it is crucial that the community is aware that controlled narcotics operations have been used successfully by Australian and overseas law enforcement bodies, and that the Ridgeway decision means that we have to give legislative backing to the method, introducing a range of strict safeguards to ensure the process is not absurd. Either we recognise that or we have our hands over our faces. We chuckle at little children for trying to hide from someone by holding their hands over their faces. That is what we would be doing if we did not acknowledge that. </PARA>

But we do not have to acknowledge that we continue to have to live with the present situation of drug laws as they operate in Australia today. Let us learn from history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995 is to amend the Crimes Act 1914. I note that it was introduced into this House on 29 June&mdash;the last scheduled day of the last sittings. It turned out not to be the last day of sittings, due to the mismanagement by the government of business in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This second reading debate has obviously been given some urgency by the government&mdash;it being the first item of government business on the first day of this final sittings for the year. The bill proposes to authorise the commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and members of the National Crime Authority to issue certificates authorising a controlled law enforcement operation involving the import, export and possession of narcotic drugs. The bill provides that, subject to certain conditions being met, certain law enforcement officers are not criminally liable for offences against the provisions of the Customs Act which prohibit the importation of narcotics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also requires the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the chair of the National Crime Authority to report to the minister on the results of applications for certificates authorising controlled operations and the reasons for the decision in each case. The bill requires the minister to report on these matters to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill has what has been described as a retrospective aspect. It provides that the fact that law enforcement officials took part in the importation of narcotics before the commencement of this bill will not render the evidence of that importation inadmissible at trial, provided that the importation was made pursuant to a request from the AFP to the Australian Customs Service for exemption from detailed customs scrutiny. I will say more about the provisions of the bill in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Article 11 of that convention deals with what is termed `controlled delivery'. Controlled delivery is defined in the convention as the technique of allowing certain narcotic drugs `to pass out of, through or into the  territory of one or more countries, with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities, with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of offences' under the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 11 imposes an obligation on Australia as a party to `take the necessary measures to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences and to taking legal action against them'. Australia thus has a positive duty to ensure that the appropriate laws are in place for a system of controlled narcotics operations to be conducted by law enforcement officials with the aim of stemming the international flow of narcotics and psychotropic substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this bill is not prompted by the government's duty to implement an international obligation. As the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) said in his second reading speech, this bill is the government's response to the decision of the High Court in the case of Ridgeway v. R delivered this year. The High Court decided in that case that, where law enforcement officials break the law by committing as principal or as an accessory the offence for any which the defendant is being prosecuted, then, as a general rule, a court should exercise a discretion to refuse to allow the evidence gathered in the course of that illegal conduct to be admitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority judges of the High Court were concerned that, when those who are entrusted to uphold the law engage in illegal conduct, confidence in the criminal justice system will be lost. These judges said that, if law enforcement officers are to be exempted from the law, then that was an issue for parliament and not for the courts. This bill would reverse the effect of the decision in Ridgeway by exempting law enforcement officers from criminal liability for certain conduct related to importation, exportation or possession of narcotics. The bill aims to ensure the evidence gathered by the police as a result of their conduct will be able to be presented to a court for consideration as evidence against the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To understand how the bill will operate, it is necessary to look at the grounds on which a certificate authorising a controlled operation may be given. There are four grounds. First, the applicant must satisfy the authorising officer that he or she has provided as much information as he or she possesses about the nature and the quantity of narcotics to which the operation relates. The aim of this is that, as far as possible, the certificate must accurately describe the narcotics in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that the suspected criminal activity under investigation would have taken place without the involvement of law enforcement officials. In the explanatory memorandum, the government states that this is to ensure that certificates are not issued to allow the police to entrap citizens who otherwise would not have been involved in the commission of a narcotics offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that the operation has a genuine law enforcement purpose&mdash;that it will make it much easier to obtain evidence that may lead to the prosecution of an offence of importing narcotics in breach of the Customs Act. Fourthly, the authorising officer must be satisfied that any narcotics involved in the operation and that will arrive in Australia at the end of the operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer. As the government states in the explanatory memorandum, it is essential, no matter the route taken or the different couriers involved, that the narcotics be under police control at the end of the operation. It is vital that drugs do not go astray and enter the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill provides that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the chair of the National Crime Authority must inform the minister of any decision to grant or refuse to grant a certificate, and the reasons for that decision, as soon as possible after the decision has been made. The bill requires the minister to lay a report about applications for controlled operations in the year to 30 June before each house of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For my part, I regard the so-called retrospective section of the bill as not retrospective in any real sense. It is a part of the bill which applies only to controlled operations started before the commencement of the bill. Its effect will be that evidence that narcotics were imported into Australia in contravention of the Customs Act is not inadmissible on the grounds that a law enforcement officer committed an offence in importing narcotics, if three things can be shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that the police officer must have been acting in the course of duty for the purposes of the controlled operation when he or she committed the offence. Secondly, it must have been a purpose of the operation to obtain evidence leading to the prosecution of a person for a narcotics offence. Thirdly, for the purposes of the controlled operation, an Australian Federal Police member must have made a written request, which purported to be made in accordance with the 1987 ministerial agreement relating to such requests, to a customs official that narcotics be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny, and that request must have been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retrospective effect of this part of the bill is to make admissible evidence that would, under the decision in Ridgeway, almost certainly be excluded from evidence against an accused in a narcotics case because of the illegality of the police conduct. On the face of it, it does not affect the elements of the substantive criminal offence with which the accused is charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This therefore appears not to be a case where the parliament is by legislation retrospectively making illegal an act that at the time it was committed was lawful. In fact, in relation to the police conduct, it is making legal an act which was illegal at the time it was committed. It appears not to have been, therefore, of the character of truly retrospective legislation that is anathema to the principles of justice to which the coalition, and I, adhere. However, it is an unusual piece of legislation, and the ramifications of it do require detailed examination. It is appropriate, in my view, that this examination be conducted by a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the issue of retrospectivity is not of real concern to me in the case of this bill, at least at this time, the question of the authorisation of controlled operations and the scrutiny and reporting requirements in relation to those operations is. It is of concern to me that the bill, in substance, seems to authorise police to authorise other police to conduct illegal operations in conjunction with persons who are believed to be criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telecommunications interception laws are, in some ways, similar to the proposed controlled operations provisions of this bill. They involve the balancing of important competing interests. In the case of the telecommunications interception laws, these are the interests of the investigation, apprehension, prosecution and conviction of people engaged in serious organised major crime on the one hand and the priceless rights of privacy and freedom of speech on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community expects and deserves high standards in its police services. One has only to look to the proceedings of the current Wood Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service to see that one need not even authorise police to partake in illegal conduct for there to be opportunities for corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the telecommunications interception laws, the provisions of this bill do not include the requirement for judicial approval or supervision of the otherwise illegal conduct. Applications for phone interception warrants are made to an eligible judge. This is defined as a judge of a court created by parliament who has consented in writing to his or her nomination and who has been nominated by the Attorney-General. It appears that so far only the judges of the Federal Court of Australia and the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia have been nominated. The phone interception legislation provides that the judge must consider the availability of alternative ways of investigating the offence and, in the case of certain offences, the gravity of the conduct being investigated and the degree of interference with the privacy of any person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the minister to consider amending the bill so that an application for a certificate to conduct a controlled operation is made to a senior judicial officer. The phone interception laws require an application for an interception warrant to be accompanied by an affidavit stating the grounds on which the affidavit is based, the period for which the warrant should be in force and the reason for the period, the number of previous applications made in relation to the person who is the subject of the application and the number of warrants previously issued in relation to that person. I urge the government to tighten up the requirements for the application for a certificate contained in this bill to bring them more into line with the more stringent provisions of the telecommunications interception legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telecommunications interception legislation also contains provisions relating to the keeping and inspection of the interception records of Commonwealth agencies. Thus, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority must maintain records relating to interceptions and the use of intercepted information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telecommunications interception laws also require the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to keep a register of all interception warrants. The register shows relevant particulars, including the date of issue and period for which the warrant is to be enforced; the agency to which the warrant was issued and the judge who issued the warrant; the telecommunications service to which the warrant relates; the name of the person specified in the warrant as the person using or likely to use the telecommunications service; and each serious offence in relation to which the judge who issued the warrant was satisfied on the application for the warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner is required to deliver the register to the minister for inspection every three months. The register is also subject to inspection by the ombudsman to ensure its accuracy and compliance with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps more can be done using these record keeping and accountability provisions to ensure that there is ultimately better scrutiny by the parliament of the controlled operations contemplated by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question, which in my view justifies the coalition's recommendation for parliamentary committee scrutiny being undertaken, relates to the relationship of this bill with state laws. State laws provide for offences in relation to the possession of, the dealing in and the use of narcotics. I ask whether the relationship of this bill with state laws has been properly examined. We could have the unfortunate situation arising whereby state police are unknowingly tracking a controlled operation and are arresting and charging Commonwealth law enforcement officers for alleged offences in relation to state laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speech of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), a number of reasons were put forward as to why this bill should be considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee has a record of dealing with related matters. In recent times it has considered and reported on the child sex tourism legislation, the International War Crimes Tribunal legislation and the search warrants legislation, all of which deal with the relationship between police powers and the citizen. Because of those factors, the committee is particularly well equipped to consider this bill. Because of the urgency of this legislation, the committee should be given, and I am sure would agree to, a relatively short timetable and reporting date in relation to its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If police are to engage in conduct that would ordinarily be criminal, such as importing heroin, in order to defeat crime, the conduct must be done in a lawful way. In other words, we need legislation which lays down the sorts of circumstances in which it can be done and we need a judicial, administrative and parliamentary process to ensure that it is always lawful, always necessary and always scrutinised. It is not merely a question of closing a loophole before too many drug dealers get through. This legislation touches the heart of our criminal justice system, and public confidence in that criminal justice system must be maintained. </PARA>

<PARA>It was a very sad day for most members of this House, certainly for those who knew Fred Daly, when we learned that he had died. He was a larger than life figure who gave great colour and sustenance to the Labor Party during most of the postwar years up to his retirement from the House of Representatives in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was very much a classic son of the Labor Party. He was the son of Irish parents, who came from County Clare in Ireland. He was one of 11 children. When he was 11 his father died, which must have been a dreadful personal blow to him. You could imagine what the loss of the breadwinner of a family of 11 would have been at that time, in the 1920s.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred left school at 14 and earned some money for the family. He took his first job with a bicycle firm as a messenger. He soon became an active member of the Federated Clerks Union&mdash;an association which he was to maintain all his life. He was a young man during the Depression, and those years of hardship no doubt stayed with him right through his life and formed his social and political views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred joined the Labor Party, seeing the Labor Party as a vehicle of social change and also the party that protected working Australians and looked after their interests. He sought to become a member of the House of Representatives, which he did for the division of Martin in 1943. He was then a member of the Curtin government. They were, at that time, in the depths of the Second World War and prosecuting the war. I know he was very upset by Curtin's death in 1945. He then remained a dedicated member of the Chifley government up until 1949 and unerringly spoke favourably about Ben Chifley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was, for the federal Labor Party, one of the links back to the Curtin and Chifley years. I think Fred was the last member of the Curtin government. Through him we have, in a sense, a connection back to that time. Though some other members of the Chifley administration are alive today, he was one of the celebrated people of that period. He spent all those years in opposition up until 1972. Like a generation of Labor people, he lost, in a sense, that opportunity, that youthful experience, he had had. He had already been in public life for a very long time by the time the Labor Party was next elected to government in 1972. He had been in parliament virtually 30 years at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with a number like him, government came a bit late in Fred's life. Though the joy that overtook him with that victory sustained him for the rest of his life, he lived through the Labor Party in the dark days of the split. Even when I came here in 1969, as a remnant of that argument some members of the caucus did not talk to others. He suffered quite substantially at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Whitlam opposition had nearly taken the election in 1969, there was a tremendous amount of goodwill between members of the party, those in factions who had looked askance at one another for a long period of time. They got themselves into a position to win in 1972. That group of people who had experienced that long period of opposition, from 1949 to 1972, were of course the core ministerial group of the Whitlam government. It was, I think, one of the things which certainly made Fred's later life. He was overjoyed by the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was Minister for Services and Property and was also Leader of the House. He was always very happy when the opposition called a division. He never liked to take a vote on the ayes. He said, `I was on the receiving end for so long, I liked to put the boot in and watch the numbers go up.' He would sit back there and chuckle away as the vote was counted. He was a great public speaker. He had huge mental agility, tremendous word flow and tremendous construction of ideas in a speech. He was humorous and mocking. He had all of the skills that the old parliamentary debate used to breed in people who had that experience. He employed those skills very effectively. He was always effective in reply: listen to an argument, see what comes your way and then put the counter case. I know it is often the job of the Leader of the House in any parliament to take the argument on behalf of the government when matters arise in the parliament, particularly at the behest of the opposition. That is true today; it was true then. He used to take the argument then and most effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He loved the cut and thrust of politics. There was a joviality about him. One of the nice things people think about Fred is that he was a jovial figure. He was a fun-loving, jovial character. That should not be seen to diminish the partisan side of him. He was avidly pro-Labor and he did not like defeats. He liked winning. When he made an argument, he made it effectively and it hit its target. He said in a book he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was privileged to serve in Parliament with some of the great political performers, masters of the arts of scorn, ridicule, satire, and humour, who used them devastatingly to win their point. Humour as practised by the masters of these skills&mdash;in Parliament or in the public forum&mdash;was not for amusement; it was to win an argument, cheerfully yet effectively.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose in many respects that says much about his own style. That is really what he did. He could be humorous and light-hearted. We saw much of that in his later life, when he left the House of Representatives. He, amongst a couple of others&mdash;I think of Jim Killen from the Liberal Party; they had a firm friendship&mdash;spent some substantial time talking about the House of Representatives and their shared experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most members know that they would see Fred in these corridors. He used to take groups of people in Canberra around the various political shrines&mdash;Old Parliament House, the old cabinet room, the party rooms, this building&mdash;and teach them about the operation of the parliamentary system and how a democracy worked, but he would also tell them anecdotes and stories as they went along. He was very entertaining and colourful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was much younger&mdash;say 20 years ago, not long after he retired&mdash;he used to do the speaking circuit. He was a scream. When he was really on his form, he was outrageously funny. He had all of these skills, but he was very passionate. I often think people saw Fred Daly as a jovial, light-hearted, high-spirited character, but he was very passionate about the things he believed in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parish priest at St Brigid's in Marrickville, in his remarks about Fred at the funeral, made some telling points about Fred's connection with his electorate and his community which were all completely true. It showed that he never lost that touch with the public or his compassion for them. He felt the need to represent their interests poignantly and he did that. He was perhaps a typical Labor figure, growing up in a working class suburb, representing it all of his adult life, staying loyal to it thereafter and, which was then an unusual thing, keeping a connection with the parliament and the parliamentary party later on though he was no longer in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, we all enjoyed him and his experiences. It is worth recording some of the positions Fred held. He was Opposition Whip from 1950 to 1956 and Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House from 1972 to 1975. He served as a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security from 1943 to 1946, a member of the Rationing Committee from 1946 to 1950, a member and later deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 1967 to 1972 and a member of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council from 1970 to 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He took a great interest in the immigration program and was very proud of the multiculturalism of Australia. Though from a classic Anglo-Irish background, he really did rejoice in the changes which Arthur Calwell introduced as Minister for Immigration in those years of government.

We were on one of the Greek liners&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australis</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Patris</EMPHASIS> or one of those; I cannot recall&mdash;and the wharfies would not dock it. Fred and Bert James got on the telephone from the ship to see whether we could get the ship docked. At each port, we would get the ship docked and we would move from one port to another. The company used to say, `You'd better come more often.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On these visits Fred used to go around and talk to the migrants, trying to keep a useful understanding of the issues. He was friendly with Sir Peter Heydon, who was then the secretary of the department. He kept more than just a political eye on the migration program&mdash;he kept not only an academic interest in it but also a practical interest in it. So Fred had those particular interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have got to say&mdash;although my friends opposite may not appreciate the point&mdash;that Fred was broken-hearted over 1975. I think that dashed his faith in the system. He had been in opposition for so long and then, when it came his turn, three years later, like so many others he was turned out. He was quite bitter about that, but he never let that bitterness intrude upon his relations with people. Perhaps `disappointment' is a better word than `bitterness'&mdash;I do not think Fred was a bitter fellow, but he was exceedingly disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the long period of Labor government from 1983 onwards meant a lot to Fred because he thought the political balance had been re-established and there was no ongoing reward for what had happened in the Senate in 1975. He put these things behind him and enjoyed an active personal and political life thereafter. He had many friends&mdash;and I am very happy to say that they were from both sides of the House&mdash;and he kept those friends right through his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He lost his wife, sadly, in the 1970s. This was a great blow to him. It took him a long time to regain his equilibrium from it. But he had the constant companionship of his daughter, Margaret, who is in the House today, and the support of his son, Lawrence&mdash;and I think this made a great difference. Of course, he had for a while a big woolly dog he called Sir John. You don't need two or three guesses to work out whom he was referring to in naming it that. Sir John used to go around the corridors with him. Fred lived here in Canberra for most of those years with Margaret, his daughter, and then later went to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will be missed by all of us on this side of the House. He was a substantial person, and he was a link for us back to those years of the Curtin government. I think linkages are important in public life&mdash;they give you continuity. If you look at those things which the Labor Party has as well as the coalition, as distinct from some of the other minor parties, there are those linkages and that continuity of policy experience, shared policy experiences&mdash;and, for us, you can go back then to the war years with, if you like, one personality whom we all knew. That gives you the stories, the attitudes, the articles of faith and the measuring rods, the measuring sticks, the calibrations, if you like, which have been provided by people like Fred Daly. We have always appreciated having them in the Labor family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, we have lost a favoured and favourite son, and we are very sad about it. On behalf of the government, I extend to Margaret, Lawrence, daughter-in-law Anne and the grandchildren, Kate, Clare and Michael, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

One of the Prime Minister's colleagues described it, as did many others on that day, as something of a great tribal gathering&mdash;and, even though I did not feel totally that I was part of the tribe, I think I could appreciate the sense of togetherness that many of the people who were there felt with the late Fred Daly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did, of course, belong to that very special working class inner city trilogy in that he was a staunch member of the Catholic Church, he was a very great Labor man and he was a passionate follower of rugby league. That is a very special Sydney trilogy. He demonstrated that in his later life, of course, when he transferred his affections from the not so visible Newtown club to the Canberra Raiders&mdash;and it was fitting that his coffin should have been carried from that church by three of the very well-known and great members of that club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Daly was a great character. He was larger than life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember when I first came here just after the 1974 election, and we were grappling with the novelty of a joint sitting. Fred was orchestrating that as the Leader of the House, asserting what he always liked to assert, of course&mdash;the predominant role of the House of Representatives in these matters&mdash;and he was not going to let that go by. I remember he came up to me and said, `Oh, you're Howard, aren't you? You've got Bennelong. Have you got that place Hunters Hill in it?' I said, `Yes, I have got Hunters Hill.' He said, `I used to have Hunters Hill. When I first represented the seat of Martin, it stretched right over the water. It started off in inner Sydney and went right over the water and grabbed Hunters Hill. They were terrific people in Hunters Hill, John, until they started to vote.'</PARA>

It was at the time of the loans demarche&mdash;whatever you want to call it&mdash;and involved that Pakistani commodities dealer Tirath Khemlani. There was a spontaneous question that came to Fred from somewhere in the back of the government benches about what this particular gentleman was up to. He described in graphic detail a media chase of Khemlani all around the back streets of Canberra. There were television cameras and there were taxis. He said, `You know what? The poor bloke ended up ensconced in a hotel. He had a fate worse than death&mdash;he had to spend three hours with Bob Ellicott and John Howard, going over his papers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did it with his great charm and his great wit, and he did it in a way that did not betray a sense of bitterness. There was nothing vicious but, boy, it was consummate in its invective, its political ridicule and its political satire. I think he could teach all of us on both sides of the House a thing or two about genuine political satire, and I thought he did it very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was, as the Prime Minister said, very much the quintessential son of the Labor Party. His commitment to the Labor Party throughout his life was admirable, obvious and all-consuming. I think nobody who attended the mass for him a couple of weeks ago would have been other than greatly impressed with the very warm words that were spoken by the parish priest about the good works that he had done amongst what would have been a lot of poverty and a lot of hardship in inner Sydney in the 1940s and early 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something to be proud of that he maintained, through his life in parliament and also in his years after parliament, a very close friendship with Jim Killen, who was a Liberal member of parliament between 1955 and 1983. They were genuine friends. They shared many jokes together; they were the butt of each other's humour in public; they debated vigorously on numerous subjects. There is not the slightest doubt that Jim Killen spoke genuinely, compassionately and from the heart when he said, when he learnt of Fred Daly's death, that he had lost a great friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will not see the likes of Fred Daly again&mdash;in the same way that you will not see the likes of somebody like John McEwen again from our side of politics. They represented an era when people lived through different times, different circumstances. Their life experience from their early childhood straddled in many cases both wars, a depression, in Fred's case two significant splits in his own party&mdash;one huge, one not so big; nonetheless, it was a painful split&mdash;and, as the Prime Minister said, some long years of opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the weekend that his wife died. It was not long before the culmination of the constitutional crisis in 1975. A number of us expressed our condolences to him in the House when it resumed. It was very obvious that he had lost a devoted wife and lifelong partner. Their faithful marriage was a great example, not only to those close to them but to many who moved in their broader community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in their comments with regard to the late Fred Daly, who, after all, was born at a small place called Currabubula, near Tamworth, in the electorate of New England, adjoining the electorate of Gwydir. That is one of those great little communities or towns, quite colourful in itself, that certainly produced a very colourful son in Fred Daly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his very last speech to the parliament&mdash;perhaps this epitomised his generous spirit and his touch of humour&mdash;Fred Daly said, `I have a soft spot for the Country Party, although it may not always be apparent. I look with great concern at Ralph Hunt and worry about how he will go in the electorate.' It is only for me to record that on one occasion, when Ralph Hunt had lost access to his accommodation arrangements in Canberra, it was none other than Frederick Michael Daly AO who came to Ralph Hunt's rescue and offered him accommodation for that period to help him out, in a way which I guess we would not see this day. It is a mark of the generosity of Fred Daly and the special bond that he had with a number of members on both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another occasion, Fred Daly was debating that vexed subject of aircraft noise. He said, again from the floor of the parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I listen to the remarks of supporters of the government who took part in the debate tonight. What a weird and wonderful collection they were. First we had the honourable member for Cowper Mr Robinson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>whom many members would remember&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who lives on the north coast of New South Wales. He is one of the people whom the aeroplanes carry over my electorate at midnight and keep half the population awake. Having to look at him in the day time is bad enough, but fancy being woken up by him in the evening!</PARA>
<PARA>I did not know Fred Daly personally very well&mdash;he was certainly an acquaintance&mdash;as I had arrived many years after he had departed the federal parliament. He was always a friendly and kindly person, though, when you did encounter him on the circuit in and around Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He certainly was a great upholder of his beliefs in the Labor Party. In his determination, dedication and in that period when he was a minister, he was extremely active in not only going about a number of changes but, in terms of electoral redistribution, putting in a particular set of clauses which have had great ramification and influence to this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the contribution that he has made to the Australian way of life, to the Australian parliament, to the communities he more directly represented and to the Australian Labor Party. In many ways, he was the very opposite of that other stalwart, Captain Sam Benson, a former member for Batman, whose death we will be noting a little later on today. Captain Sam Benson was a quiet, retiring, shy man whom I got to know as shadow minister for veterans affairs. Fred Daly was gregarious, always seemingly confident but always quite rigorous. Underneath that charming smile of Fred Daly, there was a brain ticking away, making the political points, as was his wont. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I salute the contribution that he made to the parliament and to the nation.

Therefore we must struggle as we may and make sure that all the important things about Fred get on the record as a continuing memorial for future generations of politicians and, of course, for his family represented here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two layers of memories of Fred Daly: youthful ones, because he shared, in what was very much an odd couple relationship, an office with my father for over a decade so that the times I came to Canberra Fred loomed very large in my life; and more recent ones, since we have been in government, of Fred, as a solid supporter of the government, a solid supporter of the party, being a frequent presence here in the parliament and at major public occasions, full of good advice, wit and joy of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time I saw Fred Daly was when I was opening an exhibition on the life of John Curtin to memorialise his death. This was only a few days before Fred died. Fred came along and sat conspicuously to one side to listen to the proceedings. It was extraordinary to watch how he was treated by the very large gathering as an historical object in himself. This was something that he very much enjoyed because he pointed out to everybody who came past him&mdash;correctly&mdash;that he was the last person alive who sat in a parliament with John Curtin. That is the case. His passing means that that critical link to our past has now disappeared and there is no-one alive who served in parliament with John Curtin. He had that wonderful historical presence that went along with all the rest that he represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was always curious as to how my father and he would get along. Even as a young person I could recognise a difference in their personalities. Fred explained it to me this way one day: `Your father and I get along for this reason&mdash;I am never in the office and your father is never out of it.' To some extent that summed up their personalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dad told me that one of the things he dreaded was to go on an electoral visit to Sydney with Fred because Fred was quintessentially a man of Sydney politics, quick-witted and knowing. That is Sydney politics&mdash;quick-witted and knowing&mdash;and part of that knowing is knowing everybody. A progress along a street with Fred anywhere in Sydney was a diabolically slow process. You might have thought that you would get a couple of blocks doorknocking, but you never would. You might have thought you could go a fair way down the track. You never would because Fred would stop with everybody, whatever part of Sydney you happened to be in, and engage them in quick-witted conversation and then say, `Here's Kim Beazley. What have you got to say, Kim?' `Oh, thank you, Fred.' The breadth and depth of his contacts was extraordinary,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) referred to, he was of a generation of Labor politicians&mdash;which still exists&mdash;that combines a love of rugby league, a love of their faith and their church, and a love of the Labor Party. At the memorial mass for Fred there was a wonderful comment made about one of those branch members loyally supportive of Fred Daly over the years, so confused in her relationships as a daily communicant and a regular attendee of these political gatherings that she would genuflect to the chair as she came in. There is a view that that is not an unwise thing to do anyway in the politics of the branches that we operate. So there may be more to it than the priest actually understood. Nevertheless, it was a statement too about Fred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a wonderful puncturer of pretension. My mother recalls the story of the opening of the Snowy River scheme. She and all the other members and members' spouses were boarding a bus. At the front of the bus was seated a very obvious member of the British aristocracy who was there for the occasion. Fred, at the back of the line, was obviously a little depressed at the obvious deference that was being paid this gentleman as everybody got aboard the bus. So he got aboard himself, he was just about the last one, and he spread his arms and said, `Here I am; Lord help us!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had a devotion to all forms of transport and to saying interesting things on them. My memory of him is getting on a similar mode of transport&mdash;an aircraft&mdash;and coming out of Canberra with the front end of the plane loaded with current members of parliament, as is its wont on a Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, heading down to Melbourne. When Fred got on there was always an instant presence. You could hear his voice before he came into view. So there would be absolute silence as Fred moved down the corridor. He looked at us all and said, `I'm going down the back where people pay for their own airfares.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was down on the Senate. He did not have a great deal of time for it. He used to say&mdash;and it was not original to me, though I heard him say it; it struck me as something at the time, but it was something he said to others&mdash;that in the old members' facilities there was a billiard table and it was regularly used. He used to say, `Proficiency in billiards&mdash;sign of a misspent youth or membership of the Australian Senate.' He had many more unkind things to say about senators as the years went by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody has spoken about his absence of bitterness, which was extraordinary. When you look back on his life, particularly before he got a safe seat in parliament, you see that he was involved in some diabolically bloody preselection battles. He had to have a preparedness, of course, once getting a safe seat, to fight even more bloody preselection battles, or at least the threat of them, whenever an election was likely to come on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also went through the terrible bitterness of the splits in the Labor Party of the 1950s and the great disappointment of his ejection from office along with the rest of the Whitlam government in 1975. But he could say this: `When I was elected to parliament I was told I was a oncer. I ask those honourable members opposite who hold slim seats to remember that. Then I won a second time and I was a twicer. Then the electors made me a lifer, which made me happier still. The point about the thrust of politics is that it is a dangerous thing to make permanent enemies on either side or even in one's own party, because the fellow who is against you today may be with you tomorrow.' So his personality was entirely sunny, entirely joyful and unencumbered by the barnacles that grow on all of us in politics as the years go by for which we are never careened. He was always unencumbered by that and led that joyous life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it would be wrong to say&mdash;and I conclude with this&mdash;that there was not an extremely serious side to him. He was deeply committed to democratic politics and deeply committed to the conditions of democracy in this country&mdash;how people got themselves elected to parliament, the basis on which they were elected and how they would be funded to get into those processes&mdash;because in that lay the essence of a fair system, in Fred's mind. He was able to do a deal about it when he became Minister for Services and Property and Leader of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also took very seriously what is these days now termed the social safety net. In his first speech to parliament in the middle of the war he commented on the fact that the extraordinary centralised commitment that resulted from the necessities of federal government during the war was not to be lost when the peace came. If the nation could get its resources together to successfully fight that conflict, it could get itself together to fight a conflict which had made at least as much impact on him, and that was the conflict of trying to find a means of subsistence during the Depression. The thought of that lived with him all his political life and dominated the views that he expressed in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was an extremely loyal man to his leaders&mdash;to Curtin, to Evatt and to Calwell. Pat Kennelly said, noting that, Fred would have been an ideal deputy to Gough Whitlam. That was not to be, though he rose to very great prominence. I join in the condolences to the members of his family here: Margaret, son Lawrie, daughter-in-law Anne and grandchildren Kate, Clare and Michael. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent some years in this place both as an opponent of Fred and, for the 18 months prior to that eventful 11 November 1975, as his opposite number as Manager of Opposition Business. Fred was a wonderful character and, as the Deputy Prime Minister has suggested, it would not be possible for any of us in this place to recap in a few words either the memory or the quality of the man or his contribution to Australian politics. Good humour, good intent, total motivation and driven purpose were all characteristic of the man we knew as Fred Daly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in turning back to Fred's maiden speech. He always had an ability to hit things where they really should be. Incredibly, that speech was made 52 years ago and he spoke very aptly of a matter which we have all been commemorating this week. It was in the dark years of World War II that he concluded his speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shall be my object, as a member of Parliament, both inside and outside the chamber, to see that when the war is over the people of Australia at least will live as free men and women in every sense of the word, and will enjoy social and economic security which is their right.</PARA>
<PARA>That remained his intent and his commitment. As a minister in this place, his legislative changes very much embraced what he saw as the objects of that original commitment made in his maiden speech so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The origins of Fred were very much in the heartland from which I come. He was always one who looked back on that origin with some pleasure. In the comments made at the time Fred made his last speech in the House, Gough Whitlam made a few comments about Fred's Currabubula origins. He referred to the fact that it was about the only time the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Daily Leader</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which in those days was a fairly well orientated paper politically; that is, towards the then Country Party&mdash;carried a photograph of a Labor man on the front page. Gough Whitlam continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only that, I happen to have preserved the fifth page on which there are 5 photographs of Currabubula's most famous son.</PARA>
<PARA>Fred was also quite frequent in his reference to a man called Thunderbolt, who was a bushranger in my part of the world in days gone by. I remember Fred mentioning to Arthur Fadden that his father&mdash;that is, Fred's father&mdash;knew Thunderbolt. Artie responded, `I thought he was Thunderbolt.' I can understand in some ways that sentiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In trying to express in a few moments something of the man I would be wrong if I did not tell every private member of this place that they may well not realise the debt they owe Fred. As has been explained, he spent 23 long years in opposition. He felt there was a great divide between the perks and lurks of office and the measures available to those who were ordinary members of the parliament. In the early stages of his administration of the then services and property portfolio, Fred made sure that there was some correction of that imbalance. He introduced a number of measures which private members of this place still enjoy today. Alan Reid suggested in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 25 August 1973 that Fred was about narrowing the affluence gap between backbenchers and ministers. I think that is a motivation which many who are today's backbenchers might well feel very worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking back at that same debate on the occasion of the valedictory of Fred, I remember a couple of remarks that were made. I know that we all regarded Fred as a great master of electoral boundaries so that they would advantage, naturally, the party to which he belonged. The only trouble was that I am told that in the very early days of his own candidature he was standing for the seat of Marrickville. He made one of his very early speeches in Spring Street, Bondi, which is no doubt known to the ex-member for Phillip, who is here today. At that stage Spring Street, Bondi happened to be in the electorate of Phillip, not in the seat of Marrickville. He extolled his virtues through a slogan, which I still think is magnificent&mdash;`Give us this day, our Daly Fred'. That was his slogan for his first campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back at those speeches, the bit of poetry that epitomised Fred most, and which I am sure appealed to him, was that of Jim Killen, who, as the Leader of the Opposition said, was not only a personal friend but a great political opponent of Fred. I will read that poem because it so epitomises the man as we all knew him. It says:</PARA>

It is sad that the humour which he used so effectively is so rarely present in the ordinary conduct of affairs of this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one occasion just after I had been elected in 1966, someone had mistaken me as having the name `Daly', and asked me what it was like to be Fred's son. Fred never let me forget that. I cannot really tell Margaret or Lawrence what he said and the House does not allow me to use the description he gave to me. He was quite a fellow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things have not been mentioned in the eulogies today. One affects all of us in this House. When Fred got his position as a minister, he changed the sitting rules of the House of Representatives. People forget that it was Fred who brought in the 10.30 adjournment and the 11 o'clock stop. For most of you in the House, that is a nothing, but to those few of us who are still left from those days it was magical to know that when you came back into parliament you did not have to sit here until 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock. Fred always reckoned he damaged the midnight dinners of sausages, mashed potatoes and peas which we had when we knew we were going to be here until three or four in the morning, before he brought his rules in. So all of us have a current appreciation of what Fred was about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that has not been mentioned by either side is that when Fred spoke on this side of the House&mdash;in the other building, of course&mdash;members of the government used to come and hear him. In those days&mdash;Kim's father's day&mdash;people came to hear those who they thought were entertaining and good value. People came down to hear Gough Whitlam, Clyde Cameron and Fred Daly when they sat on this side&mdash;and there were others on our side. The whole House would come down to listen to them. Can you imagine anybody today coming down to hear the good speakers on the other side of the House? It is just not on, because the mood has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred had an appeal to people in this parliament. One of the advantages of having Fred in Sydney was that you were a Sydney member. You would say to Fred, `Fred, how should we describe you?' He would say, `As a Gilroy Catholic.' The Gilroy Catholics did not join the DLP. He and Arthur Calwell shared a very real axis with each other on this very point. Again, it is forgotten by most people in the Labor Party, but, my goodness, it was not forgotten by the people in the Labor Party around Australia in the 1950s&mdash;which was even before my time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very sorry that I was overseas when the funeral took place. I want to say to Margaret, Lawrence and the rest of the family how much I appreciated Fred personally and politically. He always had something decent to say to you. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), mentioned how he would knock on our doors, and he did not care which party you came from. Whenever I saw him in Sydney, he never failed to stop and talk to me, even though I am a Liberal. That says something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My sympathy goes not only to his immediate family but also to all his siblings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many other people in the chamber today, I first came across Fred when I tuned in and listened to the parliamentary broadcasts. The first time I saw him was at the joint sitting that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) mentioned. I think I was in my last year at school. All good people at De La Salle College at Cronulla, who leant towards the Labor side of politics, would go up and tune into those parliamentary sittings. There was Fred Daly introducing and passing the legislation that delivered one vote, one value to Australia. One of the great achievements of the Whitlam government was achieved at that joint sitting, and it was the legislation pioneered by Fred Daly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that legislation, I got to vote at the 1975 election in the electorate of Cook, which is the electorate of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). Despite the fact that I had turned 18 and had the right to vote, it did not make much difference in the electorate of Cook in 1975, but I did get the chance to meet Fred Daly at an election rally at which Fred was the guest speaker in the 1975 election campaign. Despite the fact that he had announced his intention to retire, he was still out there advocating and fighting for the Labor cause. And it was not just in 1975 that he did those things. As recently as early this year, Fred Daly was up in the state electorate of Peats opening Labor Party campaign offices. He was still keeping the faith, as one of the people said at the funeral mass at St Brigid's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh) mentioned the large number of people from Marrickville who attended the service at St Brigid's. But they were not just from Marrickville. Some people came all the way from the New South Wales central coast. I refer in particular to the O'Connor family, who were mentioned in the priest's homily. I am not sure whether Fred was the one who nicknamed Alwyn O'Connor `Rule Book O'Connor', but I know that Fred certainly remembered his days of dealing with and working with people from my own part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very touching moment when during the offertory procession the jumpers of the Newtown Rugby League Club and the Canberra Raiders Rugby League Club were taken up to the altar.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Daly was awarded life membership by both the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party and the ACT branch of the Labor Party, and I cannot think of a wider range of party branches throughout the scale of membership of the Australian Labor Party. For Fred to have received life membership from both of those branches says a lot about him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bumped into Jim Killen at the airport on the morning of Fred's funeral. He was obviously very distressed and sad about the fact that Fred had passed away. Someone in my electorate mentioned the other day that it was a very touching moment to see Jim Killen interviewed on television. The fact that there was that close friendship between Jim Killen and Fred Daly says a lot about the nature of Australian politics&mdash;perhaps particularly in those days. All of us in this chamber know that there are still friendships across the aisle today, and that is a good thing. I conclude by extending my condolences to Lawrie, Margaret and all the members of the Daly family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of increases in bank charges recently announced by the Commonwealth Bank? Are they consistent with the findings of the Prices Surveillance Authority's inquiry into fees and charges imposed on retail transaction accounts? What action has the government taken to ensure that banks respond positively to the PSA report?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="30" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the reports from the weekend of increased bank charges by the Commonwealth Bank. I must say that I found them quite extraordinary in the context of the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority, as an outcome of the report which we commissioned earlier this year. That followed concern expressed in the community around January about increased bank charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report by the PSA was available in July. It expressed the view that there was a need for restructuring the charges and that banks had essentially imposed these charges without too much regard to equity and fairness. In particular, the report was very critical of account keeping fees which were payable by people with amounts of less than $500 in their accounts. There was a view that this should be restructured in this regard in particular, but also in other respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included amongst this was the belief by the authority that there should be a removal of the inward dishonoured cheque charge. That relates to when someone hands you a cheque, you bank it and it bounces. At the moment, banks charge a fee of around $9 for that and the Commonwealth Bank has now increased that charge from $9 to $10. The view of the authority was that there was no real justification for that charge because the person was not only not getting the money from the dishonoured cheque but also getting a fee imposed by the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area of bank charges is obviously one of considerable difficulty, but the report by the PSA is one which I believed the banks were going to respond to in an appropriate way. There were certainly expressions of intention by the banks following the report that they would pay close regard to the recommendations and seek to carry out its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the Commonwealth Bank is not in the spirit of that outcome. The decision by the Commonwealth Bank in respect of the dishonoured cheque charge and in respect of another item&mdash;that relates to duplicates or the reissuing of statements, for which the costs were also increased&mdash;was also the subject of a recommendation by the PSA along the lines that such charges needed to be looked at very closely in terms of their fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, what the Commonwealth Bank has done is increase its fees across a range of items, including the two that I have mentioned but also on others which were not the subject of the PSA report. In general, they have raised those charges to about the highest level of any of the other competing banks, although in a couple of cases they have become the highest. In that respect, they have taken action which can be seen to be perhaps not in accordance with the spirit of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our intention that the banks should adhere to the spirit of that report. One of the PSA recommendations was that there should be monitoring of the banks' fees and charges for the next three years. We have accepted that report and we will be formally commissioning the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to carry out that monitoring over a three-year period. That does not mean nothing happens for three years. They will monitor developments as they occur. As appropriate, the competition commission will make recommendations to us about any developments that they believe the government needs to be informed about or take action on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also spoken with the chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank and have expressed my concern about these actions. I believe it is unfortunate indeed that the Commonwealth Bank, still being majority owned by the Australian government, has taken action which is, as I see it, not in accordance with the spirit of the report and which in fact flouts a couple of the recommendations. I think that is most unfortunate indeed. We would expect the Commonwealth Bank, above all banks, to adhere to the recommendations of the PSA report. We will certainly be doing our utmost to ensure that that is the outcome in terms of the actions by the Commonwealth Bank in the future.</PARA>

When the opposition was last in government we had no competition whatsoever in telecommunications, just as we had the sclerosis of the two-airline policy and no competition at all in railways.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's view that, if the introduction of one competitor will deliver these benefits to business and residential consumers, by moving to full and open competition we can ensure that even greater benefits are delivered to everyone who uses telecommunications services.

The only way businesses will invest in generating the content in Australia is if they can sell that product to Australians; if they can use the infrastructure that Telstra and Optus Vision are rolling across the country to deliver services to Australian customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we will ensure that we have that commitment to open access; that we have that commitment to continue to encourage the development of Australian made telecommunications equipment. We will ensure that we have that commitment while also protecting the rights of business and residential consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has made those commitments that will ensure that the price caps are toughened so that the benefits for residential consumers are guaranteed, and while we have ensured that there is a cap on local call prices until at least 1999, the opposition, in reaction to that, has simply said that the government's 1999 principles are too vague. So, while all these conversations are going on opposite, we are dealing with one of the most important micro-economic reforms that this government will implement this term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that reform is taking place, but the opposition says it is too vague. That is its reaction. But Optus has welcomed the policy framework for its many policy outcomes in supporting sustainable competition. Telstra has said that it is a most important basis for the development of a competitive and innovative telecommunications industry. The Consumers Telecommunications Network has welcomed the important safeguards for consumers. The Telecommunications Industry Association says it is a visionary policy that is supported by all of the equipment manufacturers. The Australian Telecommunications Users Group says that the reforms will make the industry more competitive. So all of the stakeholders in this industry support what the government is trying to do&mdash;lower prices, make the industry more competitive and lift exports. Members of the opposition are the only ones who are saying that it is too vague and that they are not happy with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that our two aims are more competition and open access. The only person in public life in Australia who is against those two principles is Senator Richard Alston, the opposition spokesman&mdash;the man who said that he wants closed access, not open access, on the cable, and the man who said that he wants regional monopolies, not more competition in broadband roll-out. Is it any wonder that the opposition's only reaction to this important micro-economic reform is to say, `It's too vague.' We know who is too vague.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="34" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. Yes, I have seen reports; various spokesmen for the opposition have claimed that real wages have fallen since this government has been in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering this question, I think one needs to go back momentarily to what happened prior to this government coming into office. Members may recall that, as part of the total failure of industrial relations policy at the time of the Fraser government, there was a wages explosion in 1981-82 which meant an 18 per cent increase in wages in the 12 months to September 1982. Of course, that meant that there was a level of wages which were totally unsustainable. In real terms, there was a big increase in inflation. By the time we came into government, we had double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was our inheritance. It was our first duty to try to get the economy back onto a growth path. That meant some control of the wages situation through the Accord, which brought us to a growth path quite quickly and then to dramatic increases in employment&mdash;which was what everybody wanted to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the increase in wages since that time against that background, there was some reduction in real wages at the start but then we got onto a growth path. There has been an increase in real wages of some 7.4 per cent over the period that we have been in office for those on average weekly earnings; that is, for real adult average weekly earnings. That 7.4 per cent itself understates the real increase in the welfare of workers because, in addition to that, half of the work force have achieved superannuation entitlements that they previously did not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who gained from award superannuation and subsequently from the superannuation guarantee, there has been an additional six per cent payable to them as of now. That amount will move to up to nine per cent by the year 2002. It is six per cent for large employers and five per cent for small employers this year. Eventually, all of them will be at nine per cent by the year 2002. With the other measures in the budget, there are even further benefits coming by way of the government's co-contribution for employees' own contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this point, on top of the 7.4 per cent real increase in real adult average weekly earnings, we have, for those who had no superannuation entitlement, a further six per cent increase in superannuation, giving them a 13 1/2 per cent increase in real earnings. Six per cent of that is being put aside for them. For those who had their superannuation first payable when the award superannuation began in 1987, this would mean that they would have accumulated in the order of $10,500 to this stage through these superannuation entitlements, and that amount of money will grow more rapidly in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a complete furphy to say that under this government there has been a reduction in real wages. What we have had under this government has been a sensible wages policy&mdash;a policy under the Accord, which has been economically responsible, which has given us good wage outcomes in terms of getting overall growth, and which has resulted in a much faster rate of growth under this government than the previous government&mdash;about a 3 1/2 per cent average compared with a 2 1/2 half per cent average under the previous government. There has been far greater growth in employment&mdash;about three times the growth of employment in the number of jobs per year during our period of office compared with the Fraser government's period of office. In association with that, as I have just explained, there have been real improvements in wages and, through superannuation, even further increases in real wages for those who previously did not enjoy any superannuation entitlement.</PARA>

Companies like British Telecom and AT&amp;T would rather have the parent company up there in Asia winning the orders rather than their part-owned Australian subsidiary.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter that the member for O'Connor might well listen to. It is a very important matter relating to Australian citizens and changes in their attitudes towards violence. The government policies are on the right track. Our community education campaigns are working. Eight years ago, when the government asked Australians what their attitudes to domestic violence were, the picture that emerged was sadly closer to myth than reality. In 1995, as a result of community education, we as a community have a much deeper and broader understanding of violence, particularly domestic violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to release today the report on community attitudes to violence against women. The survey recently conducted by ANOP found that the majority of people&mdash;some 93 per cent&mdash;regard domestic violence as a crime. That compares with only 79 per cent of people in 1987 who thought it was a crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that 94 per cent of respondents say that alcohol is not an excuse for domestic violence and 85 per cent know that wealthy neighbourhoods are not immune from it. I am pleased to say that 80 per cent agree that domestic violence is not a private matter. So it is no longer a taboo, but a lot of people are still saying that they will not intervene and they will not assist in the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, one in five Australians were prepared to condone domestic violence in some circumstances; they were prepared to make excuses for it. But I am pleased to say that this survey found that the number had halved. Fewer than one in 10 Australians believe that physical force is justified when a man is `provoked' by his wife. I am also pleased that most people recognise that tougher laws and harsher penalties are not the solution&mdash;something that I hope members opposite listen to, because most of their state governments appear to want to reach for these solutions&mdash;and that education and counselling should be given a higher priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have established a series of campaigns which are clearly working, and we will continue with those. A lot of the funds have gone to local community agencies throughout the country to develop campaigns, training materials and resources. But that is no reason to be complacent. Violence and the fear of violence are still of major concern to Australian women and, of course, to many men. Some 80 per cent of women are worried about violence and increasing violence. So it is very important indeed for us to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, sadly we do continue to be judgmental of victims. Some 77 per cent of respondents do not understand why victims do not leave violent situations. Sadly, a significant minority feel that women make false claims of rape, which suggests a reluctance to believe victims. Those figures outline the areas in which we still have further work to do. The government will continue to lead the way in developing a better understanding of domestic violence.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Flinders moving forthwith that this House is of the opinion that the Minister for Human Services and Health should stand aside forthwith from her ministerial duties pending the completion of the Marks Royal Commission in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing more graphically demonstrates what is fundamentally wrong about this government than the Carmen Lawrence affair. Nothing could demonstrate more clearly to the Australian public the arrogance displayed by this government, particularly the arrogance of this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his senior ministers. The Prime Minister is the very person who is not in the House today because of the contempt with which he treats the Australian parliament; the very same person who told&mdash;I thought this was a classic&mdash;his backbench to get on to the radio yesterday after his incredible performance with John Laws just a week before when he made that memorable comment `what are they on about' when people were complaining about the state of the Australian economy; the very same person who said of question time that it was an indulgence given by the government for the benefit of the opposition; the very same person who calls the people's representatives in the Senate `unrepresentative swill'; and the very same person who made the incredible statement yesterday that his government deserved to be re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We contest that statement. We say that the failure of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to step aside and/or for the Prime Minister to require her to step aside is a classic example of the rotten, corrupting, contemptible arrogance which is at the heart of this government, at the soul of this government and which the Australian people are so sick to death of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our basic point is that she should now step aside. There are basically four reasons. The first is one that she herself would now understand as a matter of commonsense. I call it the `you can't hold a doorstop without being pressured' syndrome. The reality is that this is a minister whose ability to perform her ministerial abilities has been totally prejudiced and compromised by the Penny Easton affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter&mdash;and it is related to that&mdash;is that we now have a range of interest groups interested in the matters for which she, particularly as the minister for health, is responsible, saying and making clear publicly that she is incapable of performing those duties for which she is assigned as a member of the government. I have here as a reference to this an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> from only yesterday, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the disability sector, the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Medical Association all issued strong statements criticising Dr Lawrence and government health policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence clearly does not enjoy the confidence of the three health lobby groups which chose the beginning of the first week of the Spring session of Parliament to launch their attacks.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a pertinent quote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> from the editor of the disability magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Link</EMPHASIS>, Jeff Heath, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence was the most elusive and disinterested minister since the magazine was first published in 1980.</PARA>
<PARA>He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a minister who always seems to be available to discuss women in politics, but is almost totally inaccessible to organisations representing the interests of aged or disability groups.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very strong statement of condemnation from that group and clear evidence that the minister is unable to perform her duties which obviously are essentially the reason for holding down that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recapping the first reason, the minister is clearly incapable of performing her duties. The second reason is that we now have a range of persons and interest groups from the health industry who are expressing their views to the effect that she is unable to continue in her portfolio. A third reason is that there is ample precedence for ministers under pressure similar to that which the current minister is under to step aside pending an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact if you refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> you can go back to the 1940s when Eddie Ward was subject to a royal commission inquiry into the Brisbane Line. Eddie Ward, again, in 1949&mdash;this is a relevant example and precedent because he was from the Labor side of politics&mdash;stepped aside and was relieved of his administrative duties during the royal commission inquiries into allegations of corrupt allocation of timber licences in Papua New Guinea. More recently, during the Fraser administration, in 1978 the Minister for Finance, Eric Robinson, was given leave from ministerial duties during royal commission inquiries into electoral redistribution in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back on the Labor side, we have precedents not just at the federal level but also at the state level. Again more recently, this time in the 1980s, Neville Wran, when he was Premier of New South Wales, stood aside during the conduct of the royal commission headed by Sir Laurence Street into allegations of interference in the running of New South Wales Rugby League. He stood aside; he did the right thing. There was no question in his mind, given the fact that the royal commission went to activities with which he was associated, that it was right and proper for him to step aside. A third, quite compelling reason is that there is ample precedent for a minister to step aside under these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also at the political level, I do not think there is any doubt that, from a Labor perspective, there is an assessment now that the Minister for Human Services and Health is extracting a very high price for her continued position in the ministry. Let us face it: in politics, the assessment of political damage to your own side is a legitimate basis upon which ministers have stood aside in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very clear case for this minister to step aside. For that reason, the standing and sessional orders ought to be suspended so that that motion can be put to the House. The truth of the matter is that the minister is a liability, obviously going to the matters which are before the Marks royal commission in Western Australia. I do not go to those matters. I am conscious of the sub judice rule. It is our basic position that those matters are properly before the commission. They ought to be properly addressed in the commission and the commission in due course will come to its own conclusions. But you cannot deny that there has been an avalanche of evidence in recent days, all of which has contradicted a statement which the minister herself has made. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say no more than that. I refer to question time today. I am sure that will not be sub judice. When the minister was actually asked to reaffirm her own statements, she was unable to do so. In fact, only yesterday she was asked on morning radio about the state of her recollections. She was saying, `Maybe I was and maybe I wasn't.' Out of her own mouth she is condemned as to the evidence which is piling up  against her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I think is critical and should be taken into consideration is the allied controversy about the processes which the government adopted to fund this minister's legal costs. I think it is an absolute outrage that this government has just abandoned all precedent. They have abandoned the ministerial guidelines, which establish the basis upon which ministers are funded, and have set up a process by which her legal costs will be funded on a discretionary decision of the Minister for Finance, a senior Western Australian whose political interests it is to serve by promoting her defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that she was not at the time of these matters a member of the federal cabinet, let alone a member of the federal parliament. These matters go well beyond, and are beyond, her current ministerial responsibilities and there is absolutely no basis for justification for the funding of those costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to this conclusion: this is a classic cameo performance from the Labor Party. When it comes to legal costs, as usual they cannot distinguish between the national interest and the interests of the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I do so because there are three reasons this matter is fundamental to the preservation of the status and quality of this place. Unless standing orders are suspended so that we can canvass the matter of the present Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) standing aside, I believe the integrity of this place is at risk. I will look at the two legal reasons first. Section 44(v) of the constitution says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">44. Any person who&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v.) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>While I know the advice taken by the government will ensure that there is no direct contract, in my view a benefit in kind is a benefit by way of a pecuniary return. Legal aid given to the minister in the prosecution of a case&mdash;not in the defence of a case&mdash;relating to her performance as Premier of Western Australia fits within those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second legal case relates to a view expressed by a legal academic who is a reader in law at Melbourne University specialising in constitutional law, Mr Geoff Lindell. He has questioned whether the cabinet decision fell foul of a High Court ruling in 1989, when the High Court ruled that the power of appropriation reposed solely in parliament. Our constitution assures to the people the effective control of the public purse through parliament. The government's answer to that is that the money has been provided through the Advance to the Minister for Finance, but the guidelines for the Advance to the Minister for Finance say that moneys under that item should only be used:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in an emergency such as a natural disaster, an unforeseen overrun of payments, a change in payment priorities or a transfer of spending from one approved purpose to another, or where some spending has been inadvertently omitted from the annual budget.</PARA>
<PARA>While my colleagues suggest that it may well be a national disaster, it is a national disaster for the Labor Party and for the integrity of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason&mdash;the political reason&mdash;is more fundamental. The political reason why the minister should stand aside is that successive prime ministers and premiers have accepted that, when a minister misleads a parliament, the minister has committed that fundamental political sin and should no longer occupy the position of minister. Neville Wran laid down that principle; Gough Whitlam accepted it; Bob Hawke accepted it; and Malcolm Fraser certainly pursued it. Remember Ros Kelly and the whiteboard incident? Paul Keating applied that dogma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should that doctrine not apply to the Minister for Human Services and Health? Because the matter is in Western Australia? This royal commission was constituted to determine whether or not the minister committed that fundamental political sin&mdash;whether or not she as Premier misled the Western Australian parliament. That is what the royal commission is all about&mdash;why, and on what basis, is the Advance to the Minister for Finance being used to fund that prosecution? Why, when successive cases launched by the minister have failed, should legal expenses still be paid? Mind you, the plot thickens, but I have not got the time to go into all the detail. It is interesting that the firm representing the minister is the same one that Senator Loosley, a former senator for New South Wales, has joined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of interest to note that the case seems more and more to be one which rouses the ire of the public. In the latest Herald McNair poll, 77 per cent of the public disagreed with funding by the government. It is also of interest that the government is not prepared to fund similar sorts of action being launched by Brendon Kelson and Michael McKernan with respect to the War Memorial. Each of those men are distinguished public servants. Their matters were launched in quite extraordinary ways by the Merit Protection and Review Agency, with the minister responsible, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), not even being advised of the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the matter is one which I believe goes more and more to the very integrity of this government. High-handed, inappropriate expenditure of public money does not enhance the stature of democracy in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of whether or not this constitutes a vast waste of public funds, I am prepared to concede the point that it does. There is no question about that. This entire royal commission is a vast illegitimate waste of public funds, and in the first instance the bill for the representation for our minister is being sent to the Western Australian government which has announced, but not yet responded to us, that it is prepared to meet legal expenses. We await a response from the Western Australian government in that regard before it activates any decisions made by the government in support of our minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that you have been wandering around the press gallery and in public saying that the royal commission is costing $10,000 a day and that you have an objection to the waste of taxpayers' funds of $10,000 a day. Try somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 a day, which is the cost of that royal commission&mdash;an absolutely outrageous cost imposed upon the people of Western Australia by the government.

When, for example, Premier Greiner, as he then was, decided that he would take the ICAC&mdash;which effectively is an ongoing royal commission&mdash;to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, did you all stand aside and say, `Nick, you carry the costs yourself?'

Given the serious damages that royal commissions can do unjustifiably to people's reputations and that they have a great propensity to take two and two and make five, what would have been left of the reputations of just about anybody who served along the Liberal Party front bench had that matter been the subject of a royal commission if we had decided to politically have a go at you for those particular considerations? If we had decided to do that, where would you have stood? Absolutely nowhere. </PARA>

So that is one thing that you ought to notice about the terms of reference for this particular royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Royal commissions are very serious institutions indeed. They are set up to examine issues such as corruption, issues where there has been an almost terminal breakdown in public administration because there is no capacity for an element of that public administration to investigate itself. There has to be an outside process that comes in after it. To go to what a person thought they were doing at the time, the state of their mind, on a matter of pure politics, is an extraordinary thing for the terms of reference of a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you take it a point further than that and say, `Okay, what the person was thinking about was a matter of some seriousness'&mdash;which of course it was not, it was pure politics that produced that, but let us just accept that for a moment&mdash;not to incorporate in the terms of reference of the royal commission all the matters that had been raised in that regard over time in Western Australian public forums, because all that petition which is the subject of the royal commission was was a rehashing from a different angle of matters that had been raised in parliament by Mr Court and successive other Liberals&mdash;exactly those matters&mdash;if your concern was the fact that those matters canvassed in the parliament ought to have been the subject of a royal commission, what you ought to be up there doing is demanding that the royal commission's terms be open. But you will not do that, because the simple fact of the matter is that this is an extraordinary political exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter obviously of the deepest concern and worry to all people who would be associated with the person. But let me say this: the royal commission is not inquiring into that. When those matters were raised, quite sensibly, the royal commissioner got up and said, `This is not a matter for me to inquire into.' So even though there is this constant juxtaposition in the media&mdash;this set of events occurred and then the suicide occurred&mdash;the fact of the matter is that there is no light to be thrown on that issue by the operation of the royal commission, and it is deliberately excluded. There was no coronial inquiry; there was an inquest which, as you know, is a very different matter indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to know, either extend the terms of the royal commission or put in place a coronial inquiry, which might go to establishing those facts; but they are not there. There are so many Banquo's ghosts at this particular feast in terms of the terms of reference of that royal commission that you could fill Glamis Castle where for centuries on so many of Banquo's ghosts are missing at this feast&mdash;a narrowly defined set of terms of references to target a Commonwealth minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you think for one minute this royal commission would be in place were she not a Commonwealth minister? Of course it would not. Do you think for one minute that, if some advantage had been perceived at the time by the Liberal Party, in the two years after he became Premier before he instituted this, when he had ex-Premier Lawrence before him in the parliament, if he thought it were serious he would have failed to have had the courage to raise it? Of course he would not. The simple fact of the matter is that politics drove him to do it. Politics underpins the terms of reference in this royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not respect the political motives that go into the underpinning of this royal commission. We reject the view that one of our ministers ought to be targeted by that royal commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I wish to be associated briefly with this condolence motion. I noticed in reading an item in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of 17 May 1992 that, in writing of Fred Daly, Elisabeth Wynhausen had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though it is difficult to imagine, there was a time when even Fred Daly was young. First elected to Federal Parliament in 1943, he was so raw, he said, that he took people who visited him in Canberra to the cafe in the main street for bangers and mash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He didn't know politicians were allowed to take visitors to Parliament House for lunch.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was an interesting observation to make about a person who took a great deal of time to help those who came to the parliament to get to know their way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I arrived here as the member for Parramatta in 1973 it was quite interesting that, although he campaigned vigorously against me&mdash;I even know at what booth I saw him on the day of the by-election; it was the Epping School of Arts&mdash;he was one of the first to welcome me to Parliament House. As I was elected in a by-election, he, along with then Speaker Cope, arranged a small function for people to meet me and to make me feel very much at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that he did say to my wife that, while welcoming us, he did not wish me a long stay. That sense of humour was well understood as I was holding what was seen then to be a marginal seat. I guess that he really did not wish me a long stay but, while I cannot say I am rivalling him, 20 years having passed, I feel I have in some way proved him wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense I followed what he did as a minister quite closely because he had responsibility for electoral matters. I note that he was the member for Martin and the member for Grayndler and at times had to contest a number of ballots, even after redistribution, to remain in the parliament as long as he did. Many of us who have suffered the vagaries of redistribution will have noted how adroitly he managed to achieve that and it is an example that some of us have tried to emulate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Daly was a person of remarkable skills and remarkable humour. He was one who did have a life beyond this parliament, which many politicians do not have. I noticed in my mail this week that I received an invitation to a function here at Parliament House organised by the aged-care community in which they, having printed their invitations some weeks ago, had included Fred as a principal speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having known Fred for a long time both in and out of the parliament, I wanted to be associated with this condolence motion and extend to his daughter, Margaret, and son, Lawrie, my commiserations and those of my family at this time of their loss. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Watson)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess one of my earliest political memories was when I was about 10 or 12 years of age helping my father hand out Labor how-to-vote cards at the Globe Kindergarten in Perry Street, Marrickville, for Fred Daly in a federal election. As I got a little older and went to high school I was in the same class as Lawrie Daly. I remember as a young lad at that school&mdash;De La Salle, Marrickville&mdash;that the nicest and most consistent person who worked on the school tuckshop was Mrs Daly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Fred's funeral, which was certainly not so much a time of unhappiness but a genuine celebration of a good person's life, the things that were said by Terry Sheahan, the President of the Labor Party in New South Wales, and the parish priest, Father Tom, were genuine heartfelt things about Fred Daly, who had been the local member for that area from 1949 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was very much an old-fashioned member of parliament. He worked hard in his constituency. Members of parliament in those days probably did a lot more electioneering than we do now. They did not have all the electorate secretaries that members now have. They did not have all the telephones, direct mail, faxes and all that. What they actually did was what members of parliament probably should be doing now, which was getting around the local area and providing a service to the people who lived in that area. Electorates in those days were a lot smaller and the Grayndler electorate was basically the suburbs of Marrickville, Enmore, a bit of Dulwich Hill and that area. Fred Daly was a byword in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Father Tom said at the funeral, the Labor Party and the Catholic Church in Marrickville were pretty much one and the same. The story told about a woman called Mrs O'Connor, who mistakenly genuflected when she came into a meeting of the central Marrickville branch, is probably true, because when I arrived at the church and walked in the door on the morning of Fred's funeral I was met by one of the church wardens handing out the order of service who happened to be a fellow called Claude Danzy, who had been a long-term vice-president of the Central Marrickville branch of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the people who were there at the funeral&mdash;the local people as well as the people who knew Fred both in politics and in other parts of his public life&mdash;the local people were the ones I think Fred would have been most glad to see there. It is a credit to the thoughts of his family that they had what has been the largest state funeral in Sydney in recent years not in the cathedral, where those things are usually held, but in Fred's local parish church, St Brigid's at Marrickville, because Fred Daly saw his role as the member for Grayndler as probably more important than any other job he had done in his life&mdash;other than maybe rugby league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I ought to set the record straight in one small way. There has been a lot of alluding here today and in the press earlier to Fred's love of the game of rugby league, which is certainly very true. People mention how wonderful it was that three of the pallbearers at his funeral were people who play for the Raiders&mdash;Laurie Daley and two other Raiders players. What they forget is that there were three other pallbearers at the funeral who were former players for the Newtown Rugby League Club. One of those pallbearers who was a particularly fond friend of Fred's was Frank Farrington, who was a long-term secretary of that club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting point for members to know that Fred, on the day he died, had come down to Sydney from Canberra to attend a fundraising function for the Newtown Rugby League Club, which was held that night down at South Sydney Leagues Club because Newtown is a much smaller club than it was in Fred's day and plays in the Metropolitan Cup competition. Fred still maintained his contact with that club, and a book they put out that night talked about the leagues club and its connection with the Labor Party. So the three things in Fred Daly's public life&mdash;the church, the Labor Party and the football club&mdash;are very much intermingled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred's family were very active at the grassroots level. Fred's son, Lawrie, rather interestingly followed me as the assistant secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales, as I had followed his father as the member for Grayndler. Since the division of Grayndler was formed in 1949 there have been only five members for Grayndler. Fred Daly was the member from 1949 to 1975; Tony Whitlam, from 1975 to 1977; Frank Stewart, from 1977 to 1979; me, from 1979 to 1993; and the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mrs McHugh, from 1993 until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred had 26 years as the member for that division and 30 years in the federal parliament. I do not think many of us here will do 30 years in the federal parliament and I doubt whether there will ever be another member for Grayndler who does 26 years as the local member. In that time Fred became an institution both locally and nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers on this condolence motion have said, Fred was someone whom we will not see the likes of here again. I think that is a sad thing in a lot of ways, because those of us who have been here for a little while probably miss the characters that there were in the parliament who do not seem to be here now. I know that if Fred were still a member of parliament he would not like this chamber. It certainly does not have the same intimacy as the chamber in the old building had which I think allowed that cut and thrust that made those great debaters perform better than this chamber allows us to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Daly is a person who is missed most particularly by the people who knew him down in Marrickville and by the people in the party in his area. Some of the people who were his lieutenants in the party&mdash;I got to know them as I grew up in Marrickville and as the local member&mdash;were people who stuck to Fred through thick and thin and were absolutely loyal to both him and the Labor Party: people like Reg Willard and a terribly interesting fellow, who probably in the past I have never called an interesting fellow, by the name of Jimmy O'Halloran, who had been the returning officer for Fred's electorate council for many years. O'Halloran always used to boast that no-one was ever going to beat Daly as long as he was the returning officer. Daly's enemies never quite knew whether they should try to get rid of O'Halloran first or Daly first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was a fellow who, over the years, showed young people in the party such as me that he had seen the hard times of the Labor Party. He had a brief time as a minister, when he achieved some of the things he looked forward all his political life to doing. Unlike a lot of us when we retire from this place, Fred was able to make the transition to retirement very well and was able to come back here and pass on to people some of the things that he had learnt as a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was also always able to pass on some good humour. As a couple of people have mentioned, he would burst into your office with people on his interesting tour and say, `This is so and so. I have known him all my life. You really want to meet these people, don't you?' You would think, `My goodness, of course I want to meet them, Fred. They are obviously your relations too.' He had that infectious ability to put people at ease and to impart, through humour, a very good message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Fred's funeral was a celebration of his life. I do not think his funeral could have been better if he had organised it himself. Some people suggest he probably was orchestrating it from heaven anyway. Fred Daly was certainly in that great tradition of Irish Catholic Labor members of parliament who have enriched both our party and this country. He will be missed by all those who knew him. Gone with Fred Daly's passing is not only a link with the history of Australia, with his link with the Curtin government, but also the little bit of light that used to shine into our lives as he went around the building from time to time. I used to argue with him and fight with him, and I will miss him terribly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fred Daly will never die, at least not until the last person touched by his life has passed on. I think all of us who were present a few days ago at St Brigid's for the requiem mass would appreciate the significance of some 600 to 700 ordinary Australians being present. Sure, at the top of the church there were former prime ministers, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Governor-General, a squad of ministers and numerous other mere mortals like us. But the hundreds of people that were there were not there to honour Fred Daly, former minister; they were there to honour Fred Daly, their friend, their mate and their supporter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have been told, throughout Fred's political life, some 30 years in parliament, he lived through, as did many of his constituents, some of the most difficult days that Australia has ever known&mdash;the Depression, the Second World War and the need to reorganise the nation that followed it. In all of that, Fred had 23 years in opposition. Having had nearly 13 years of my own in opposition, I sympathise deeply with people who have had that experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout those years Fred demonstrated a degree of sagacity, determination and reliability which is quite unique in political terms. There are very few of us in the chamber now who have any personal experience of working either alongside or opposite Fred Daly, member of parliament, minister, Leader of the House and colleague. I am one of those fortunate enough to say that I have been touched by Fred. He often gave us harsh medicine, but he did so with a smile and a joke. While many of us had to bear the brunt of his tongue on occasions, I do not recall anybody ever doing it without a smile. That is a very rare trait which he was undoubtedly able to demonstrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been pointed out by the government whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), at St Brigid's the other day, when we saw all those people, there was a celebration of Fred's life. It was indeed. One could go a little further and say it almost had, shall we say, the characteristics of an Irish wake about it. As the parish priest told us, in Ireland on that very same day a requiem mass was also being said for Fred, again to emphasise the linkage between his past, his present and no doubt his future. Fred was indeed an Irish Catholic of which the church could be very proud. He did in turn give of his best for his God, his faith, his party and his football team. All the things that were important to him, to his community and to the people he represented Fred stood for as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What touched me in the eulogy from the altar was the emphasis given to his wife, who, throughout the years which they lived together, was simply known as `Mrs Daly'. The respect shown to her epitomised in a very real sense the love and the devotion of that married couple on the one hand, and on the other the way in which both of them together had managed to forge in a political environment a relationship with their constituents which reached its fulsome totality at that mass at St Brigid's on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I owe much to Fred. He was always a friend to me, even though I was on the other side. Last May, when I faced my political Garden of Gethsemane, if I may use that term, Fred rang me up twice before the event and he phoned me once afterwards, which I thought was an extraordinarily kind, generous and sympathetic gesture from a fellow human being who understood the realities of political life and its ups and its downs&mdash;and for all of us ultimately it is a down. There he was, lending me his support and his hand at a time when I certainly wanted it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made, and I just want to reiterate it, that in the context of parliament Fred was a great reformer of parliament. He did certainly change the sittings of parliament and the conditions under which members of parliament have had to work since. I want all of those who have come in since Fred was here to remember that he was the person who made the changes from which we have all benefited. The conditions of parliamentary service were significantly improved because Fred realised, after having spent so many years here and seen what the benefits of ministerial service were on the one side compared with the obvious penury of being on the back bench on the other, that there needed to be a rebalancing, and he carried it through. In those two acts, while at the time he was criticised for them&mdash;of course, every time there is a parliamentary salary increase there is always criticism&mdash;nevertheless he realised that for the benefit of service of the parliament it was necessary that those who worked within it did so under reasonable conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was also the `King of Canberra'. He was loved in this his adopted town. His Canberra tours, especially to Parliament House, became popular for visitors to this city. If you came to Canberra and you didn't get in the bus and go with Fred on a tour of Canberra, you had obviously missed out on something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also his books, his speeches. Fred demonstrated that he had a very real and a very full life after politics. As I said, those who remember him were undoubtedly touched by his life and we are the richer for it. I thank his daughter, Margaret, his son, Lawrence, and his grandchildren for the contribution they made to the parliament by being part of Fred's family. I join everyone else who has spoken on the condolence motion on this occasion. </PARA>

He was a man of great commitment, of great humility and, at times, of excessive humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To many of us, when we first came to this place Fred Daly was a guide and a teacher. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat referred to Fred making assistance available to members. I came into this parliament as one of the Whitlam team in December 1972. When we first met in February 1973, there was none of the assistance available to members, particularly to new members, that is available to members and new members today. We were parcelled into a room, given a pad, some writing implements and a telephone and that was it. There was no guide for getting around the house. It was a feat to find your way around Old Parliament House. I asked for a map or for some sort of chart to find my way around the house because it was much more of a labyrinth than this place is, but there was no chart or layout of the parliamentary building available. We were just thrown in the deep end and sank or swam on our own efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only persons who took an interest in new members at that time were Fred Daly and Rex Connor. Fred Daly had a general approach to politics: what he wanted in the chamber, as he told a number of us, were generalists&mdash;people who could rise to their feet at any time and participate and support the then government in debates that may arise. He did not have much of a brief for the narrow specialists who were around at that time. He wanted more people with a generalist background who could support any issue that arose on any subject that arose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been thrown in the deep end, in the evening after the tea break often Fred Daly and Rex Connor, separately, would invite a number of us, including the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who was already here when the rest of us came, to their ministerial offices to give us some clues on where to find quite simple stuff, where to gather information from, what was expected of us in trying to put together a speech and how to find our way through the caucus committee system. They were the very basic things we needed to know to carry out the work that we were sent here to do. Those of us who were involved&mdash;John Kerin, me, the Prime Minister and Joe Berinson&mdash;and had that support and guidance benefited from it very much. We appreciated it very much because there was no other way. There were no word processors, as are provided now. You wrote everything in longhand and you did it by yourself. You did you not have the luxury of typists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield, said, in Fred's time he brought in the assistants, who were paid the princely sum of $8,000 per year to provide us with some sort of assistance around the chamber when we were down here. Fred Daly played a very important role in his great love; his great love was the parliament. He had a wonderful belief in the parliamentary process&mdash;the practising of parliament itself. Many members who came through this place have a great deal to thank Fred Daly for. I put it down to the fact that he had experienced hardship himself. He knew what it was like to start off without anything and he was passing on the benefit of his experience to those who followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the wonderful aspects of Fred's character was that as a Labor man he never forgot his roots. He never ceased to be a humble Australian. As a former member of parliament, he kept a very active interest in the political scene. It was not unusual to get a phone call or a visit from Fred in the old House or in this House and be told what was going on. I admired his faculty, his sharp grasp and his distinctive feel for what the public were thinking, what was a good issue, what was being handled well and what was not being handled well. Right to his last days, he retained that capacity. I thought that was a wonderful trait of character and he had a wonderful aptitude. It was part of his love for the political life, because it was his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Daly maintained that strong interest in political events. He loved the parliamentary scene, as I have referred to. You had to really see his humour in the old House to understand it. If you are looking for a speech that would be the most uproarious speech ever made in parliament, it was the speech he made in May 1973. I will go over the background of that speech made in the old House. The opposition had attended some kind of dinner or function during the tea break. We broke from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. The debate before the break had been a bit hot and a bit vivid. Fred came in after 8 o'clock to settle things down. Some of our colleagues on the opposite side of the House in the old chamber were a little relaxed. They were not tired and emotional, but a number of them were certainly a bit flushed faced and a little relaxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Fred came into the debate it was the most uproarious 20 minutes that one would ever hear in the parliament. In it he described the courtship of Vince Gair by Doug Anthony. Only he described it as the courtship by the National Party of the DLP. That was happening at that time. Fred managed to translate it and describe it as the courtship of the old whore by this shiny young man with this great blonde tuft of hair. What a handsome young man he was. During the debate, he became so agitated that he almost finished on the wrong side of the table as he walked up and down the chamber describing all of these events that were taking place. He said what a wonderful wedding it was going to be when finally the old whore was churched by this shining young man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend reading that speech very strongly. I was sore from laughing during that speech. It was Fred Daly at his absolute best. It is probably the classic of how humour can be used in a fun way. Underneath that humour of Fred Daly, there was an underpinning of serious business. He had a debate to cool down and an argument to cool down. He did it with humour, but undermined it completely in a way that nobody could take offence at. Both sides of the House were in continuous laughter at the argument that he put and the descriptions he made to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wanted to say that Fred Daly went to the  electorates of a number of us over the years in which he participated in fundraising exercises. He came along and told the gatherings&mdash;he was a very positive speaker&mdash;about his experiences and parliamentary life. On the last occasion in which he spoke in my electorate he talked about the ghosts of Parliament House. I am quite sure that the spirit of Fred Daly will long inhabit the old Parliament House down the hill. He used to tell us about the ghosts that haunt the corridors as he related all the strange events that had taken place over the many years that he had been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you walk around the provisional Parliament House and you catch that infectious laughter in the distant corridor, you can be sure that will be Fred as he walks around the building keeping check on the spirits and ghosts there. That building and the events in that building were very much part of his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the funeral at St Brigid's that most of us attended, I spoke afterwards with Jim Killen. Jim Killen said that Fred Daly stole his lines and his jokes. Fred Daly was sure that Jim Killen stole his jokes. I suppose I can say now&mdash;I am sure Jim Killen will not mind&mdash;that there was an occasion when I had a brilliant idea. I thought what a wonderful night it would be if we got both of them together on the one platform. They could regale the gathering with their reminiscences of their funny times and funny experiences of political life. But I learnt after that that was mission impossible. I learnt why it was impossible to get both of them together on that kind of platform. They had that rivalry and good humour between political opponents that we do not see in this place today. Today it is a much more dour parliament, a much more bitter parliament, a parliament without humour and certainly with much less of the goodwill that was the parliament of the time of Fred Daly and Jim Killen. At the funeral I said to Jim Killen afterwards, `Jim, you've lost your partner.' He said, `No, I've got an advocate in the place that you haven't got one.' That was the ultimate in Jim Killen and Fred Daly; that he had an advocate in the place that I did not have one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say to Lawrie Daly, his sister Margaret and to all the members of the Daly family that this nation has been fortunate to have had Fred Daly as a member of its parliament. It has been fortunate for the contribution that he has made over many years. As I said earlier, it is not just what Fred Daly did himself as a member of the parliament and as a minister of the government of Australia; it is the contribution that he made to the careers of so many other members of parliament in the parliamentary process, both in the provisional building and in the current building because that guidance and advice carried on. </PARA>

One I would like to refer to is this. Fred said, `If you want to be an expert you don't need to have gone to school; you just need to have outlived everybody.' He sought to do that himself, I am sure. He clearly pursued that objective.

That was a gracious gesture of goodwill by Ian Sinclair towards a person campaigning against him in his electorate. </PARA>

Fred had a great old English sheep dog that he called Sir John&mdash;after Sir John Kerr. I said that we would get more public attention and more media coverage if we got Sir John to officially open the campaign rooms. I said the headlines then were more likely to be `Man bites dog'.

The Leader of the House calling for a division? Someone said to him, `Fred, you don't have to call for a division on that; the government has the numbers.' His response was something like this: `I've been here for over 23 years, and for the last 23 years we didn't have the numbers. I just want to savour it.'

That a person could treat himself so lightly and with such humour as that indicates the measure of the man.

It was regarded as very hazardous for an MP in a marginal seat to go away on a long excursion. Because of this excursion, he acquired the sobriquet of `Dilly Dally Daly', which took him a long time to live down.

Fred Daly went down to see Haylen. When he came back, Evatt asked, `How did you get on?' Fred said, `It's all right. He was very excited. He said to say thank you, that he'd never forget it, that he was very grateful and that he would indeed make the speech of his lifetime.' Evatt said, `Good.

He had come all the way from Singapore at his own cost and without a visa to clear his name and he had all that excess baggage with him. What must he think of Australia? His life was endangered by high speed car chases in Commonwealth cars, his bags were searched by bearded investigators&mdash;as far as we know they were not false beards&mdash;and he was booked into a $23 a night room next to a shoe shine box, yet his bags were booked into a $33 a night international hotel.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very good passage that gives great memories of the flavour and the colourful character of Fred Daly and the sort of contribution he made in this place. I take a lesson from that, as I am sure all members of parliament do, that Daly's use of humour and ridicule with goodwill were very important. It gives an important lesson for today's parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflecting further on Fred Daly's life, one of the things I have tried to follow in my life&mdash;and I think members would relate to this&mdash;is the ideal of service to family, community and nation. Fred Daly did these three things so effectively, but he did so much more. This is the message I took from his state funeral in understanding his life&mdash;the faith, the loyalty and the service he displayed not only to family, community and nation but also to his party, the Australian Labor Party; to his union, the Federated Clerks Union; to his church, the Catholic Church; and to his football teams, Newtown and the mighty Canberra Raiders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He led a big life&mdash;a life that was full of faith, full of loyalty and full of service to each of those seven institutions. We now associate with Fred Daly all the best features of Australian parliamentary debate&mdash;the sharp wit and the goodwill. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) mentioned that wherever Fred is right now&mdash;and by his faith it is with his maker&mdash;he would be taking great interest in these proceedings. In spirit, he is sure to take great interest and pride in his son Lawrie's career, as he has always done in the past. I hope and trust, as do many other members, that Lawrie will soon enter the New South Wales parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel very privileged to participate in this condolence motion for Fred Daly and to extend my condolences to his family. It was a wonderful moment in my life when, on the opening of this parliament in 1993, I found myself being introduced to not only Gough and Margaret Whitlam but also Fred Daly. I was able to introduce my family&mdash;my husband, my mother-in-law and my two daughters. To come face to face with an icon, someone I felt privileged to listen to all the time I was growing up, and meet him was such a privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of days later I referred to this in my first speech. Some time subsequently, Bray Gray, the widow of former member for Capricornia George Gray, visited Canberra and went on one of Fred's tours. Most fortunately, Fred was taking the tour personally, as we know he did on so many occasions. Fred's comment to Bray was, `I knew you weren't dead because the little girl from Capricornia mentioned you in her maiden speech.' I took it as a great compliment that he had remembered me at all. Whereas I might bridle at times at comments such as that from some of my colleagues, from Fred, who I found to be an absolutely darling man, it was a great compliment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel quite sure that there were hundreds of women in love with Fred because he was the sort of man that women of all ages absolutely fell in love with without being able to help themselves. Certainly, whenever I would meet him around the parliament, he was always so delighted to meet you and he would say to his group of visitors, `We have finally found a member. They are so hard to find in this building.' He was making some comparison with the old parliament house, where you tripped over members. I really enjoyed those encounters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I am very sad about is that Fred had agreed to try to come up to my electorate to speak at a special dinner we had planned to honour the memory of Frank Forde, a former member for Capricornia who had been Acting Prime Minister and Minister for the Army during the Second World War. The most recent communication I had from Fred was a faxed letter on 28 July confirming his phone call to say that he was not able to come up to our proposed dinner because his health had not been so good. In this letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would indeed like to be able to join you all on this occasion to pay tribute to Frank. He was a man of complete integrity, loyal and dedicated to the ALP&mdash;a real true believer.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is what we could say about Fred himself. It has been a privilege to hear so many expressions, from both sides of the House, about the nature of Fred Daly. One of the things I was also very disappointed about was my inability to attend his funeral. It was something I would love to have done, but I had already a number of very important commitments in my electorate that related to issues such as the Australia Remembers program. I thought to myself that I know Fred would have valued the fact that I was putting off a personal need to attend what was obviously a marvellous tribute to him, his funeral service in Marrickville, to do what he would expect a Labor member to do; that is, be with my constituents and continue representing the Labor Party and continuing its finest traditions. I had to content myself with that thought when, personally, I would love to have been there to pay personal tribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His passing is a great sadness to us all. I think we tended to feel that he was quite indestructible and would be with us forever. That, of course, has proven not to be true. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he was that last link with the Curtin government. We will all be diminished by that loss, but for all that he gave to all of us personally&mdash;his wit, his good humour, his compassion, his humanity&mdash;we have all been enriched. I am sure that his family feels very proud by the contribution he has made to Australian public life. I am delighted and privileged to be able to contribute to this condolence motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bananas indeed. I had the happy circumstance of being the inaugural El Presidente of the Banana Republic&mdash;not the one that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has spoken about from time to time, but the real Banana Republic, which was the tourist promotion of Coffs Harbour some years ago. The special relationship with Fred was that he was my Raving Ambassador and Minister Plenipotentiary. We had a whale of a time together. He came to Coffs Harbour many times, particularly for the launch of the tourist promotion, which was a surprisingly successful one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very first time we got together officially was on the day of the launch. I can recall driving with my head sticking out of the cabin of a World War II truck with a lion draped across the roof of the cab of the truck as well. Mind you, it was only a 19-month-old lion and was very friendly and absolutely loved and adored me. I can assure honourable members that unless you have had your face licked by the sandpaper tongue of a 19-month-old lion, you ain't lived. It is quite an experience. Fred and I were involved in that. Of course, he was at his wonderful witty best in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did a number of promotions together. We both wore a funny sort of uniform&mdash;green and yellow with little plastic banana medals hanging off us. I can well remember the time we went into radio station 2UE in Sydney both wearing our banana medals and wearing these silly uniforms. The receptionist said, `Are you the two Ronnies?' I don't know which one was supposed to be which. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred was a wonderful man. Like the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who spoke before me and who was not able to go to his funeral, I was unable to attend his funeral. I would very much like to have attended. I do assure the member for Capricornia that Fred would have been happy that I was looking after my constituents, just as she was looking after hers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the night of his funeral, we did hold a wake for Fred in the Coffs Harbour Yacht Club, which was one of the venues where we used to have many exploits in the period of time we were working together to promote the tourism of that area. Quite a number of stalwarts who were involved in that promotion got together and we all had a drink or three. I didn't have very much; I only had soda water because I had to go back to a meeting at Macksville that night. The mob got together and said farewell to Fred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had the capacity to generate enormous affection for himself. He was well liked and loved everywhere he went. I will not tell all the stories; I will tell only one story. He gave me advice from his background. He said, `Of course, Garry, this is what you have got to do when the election is on and you have got a polling place where there is more than one entry or more entries than you've got workers to go and be at the gate. What you do is go out very early with your piece of chain and your padlock and you chain them up so that nobody else can get in.' I have never had to follow that advice because I have always had plenty of workers there to man the gate. That was just one of those wonderful little bits of advice that Fred gave out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very warm human being, a wonderful Australian. I really am thrilled that I had the opportunity of working with him so closely. I can remember his dog, Sir John, who used to come to Coffs Harbour, too. He used to hop in and out of the back of our Nissan Patrol. I also remember meeting Margaret, his daughter, who came to Coffs Harbour at that time, too. I send her the good wishes of all of the people of Coffs Harbour who were involved in that particular promotion.

Fred was a great Australian and a great advertisement for Australian politics. That was very much the impact he had in the community. I was very pleased to be able to be part of bestowing that honour upon him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995, which emerges from a case known as the Ridgeway case, which was recently determined in the High Court. Essentially, as I understand them, the facts were that a person, a Mr Ridgeway, was in prison for other matters and he met there another person who, I believe from memory, was a Malaysian national. They entered into a scheme to import heroin from Malaysia into Australia. Unknown to Mr Ridgeway, the person with whom he entered into the scheme was in fact a police informer, who, on his return to Malaysia, informed the Malaysian police of the scheme. They, in turn, informed the Australian Federal Police, who then entered into a scheme to import heroin into Australia to, in effect, enact the intended parts of the crime in order to ensure that Mr Ridgeway could be apprehended and charged with the relevant offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What followed was that the matter ended up in the High Court, where the court determined that the existing administrative arrangements that applied to giving exemption to police conducting these sorts of activities in order to apprehend an offender did not provide sufficient basis for immunity, nor did they effectively enable evidence to be admitted that was illegally obtained. Therefore, the obvious consequence of this decision was that a legislative basis needed to be established to ensure that activities of this nature could continue to be conducted by the police in order to ensure, ultimately, that people could be apprehended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that the Australian Federal Police commissioner, deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner, or a member of the National Crime Authority, can provide a certificate of authorisation which would permit members of the Australian Federal Police to engage in activity, which would otherwise be criminal, in order to bring about the arrest and conviction of a person engaged in, or intending to engage in, activities in contravention of section 233B of the Customs Act 1901&mdash;in other words, the importation of prohibited substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of tests apply with respect to the provision of this certificate. It is only available, obviously, if all relevant information is provided to the decision making party. It applies only where the person concerned is `likely to commit an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or an associated offence whether or not the operation takes place,' the operation being, of course, the police intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third limb of the test is that the controlled operation will make it `much easier to obtain evidence' with respect to that offence. Finally, it is required that the illicit substances that are the subject of the operation will at all relevant times remain under the control of the police officers involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, the Minister for Justice must at the earliest practicable opportunity be notified of the operation that is proposed and he or she is also required to table annually in parliament a report specifying all certificates that have been issued and all of the relevant details. Obviously, the details would be included in this report only after the full conclusion of a particular operation, including charges having been laid, a trial having been completed and convictions having been obtained or acquittals having been arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that this situation caused some interesting debate within the government about the appropriate response to the dilemma that had been raised by the Ridgeway case. I was an active participant in that debate. There were a number of concerns about how the government should proceed. I still share some concerns about this legislation; I will get to those in a moment. But I do not believe that some of the concerns that have been raised have any great foundation, and I would like to comment on a couple of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I concur with the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) who in his earlier contribution said that retrospectivity is not really a concern. Although there is a technically retrospective aspect to the legislation, it is not such that it would give rise to concern of the usual type which most of us do raise when issues of retrospectivity are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there has been some suggestion that in some way this legislation may be unconstitutional. I do not accept that suggestion. I see no basis on which this legislation could be challenged in the High Court as being in breach of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it has been suggested that, rather than the Australian Federal Police commissioner, deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner having the responsibility for issuing certificates authorising the relevant behaviour, it would be better if it were performed as a judicial function. I have some serious concerns about that suggestion. First, it would have to be handed over to the states, because chapter III of the constitution would prevent the federal judicial bodies from conducting that sort of activity because it is a non-judicial activity, and there would be significant problems in making arrangements with the states to do that. But, more importantly, it starts to blur the role of the judge, the role of a court, and it almost tends to drift into the area of giving advisory opinions, so that, in effect, what you would be doing would be asking a judge to give a preliminary opinion about whether certain types of conduct by the police would be within or outside the law with regard to a particular drug operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, to take these sorts of things to the courts to obtain certificates appears at first glance to be very good protection against potential abuse. But we need to keep in mind that ultimately the role of the courts is to make judicial decisions; to decide actual cases, live matters. If you start loading up the courts with administrative functions of this nature, a gradual perversion of the role of the court potentially threatens. So I do not have concerns about those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, there are some concerns that I would like to raise. The first is the question of entrapment. In my view, the Australian legal system, in the various state guises and federally, has always on balance got the issue of entrapment reasonably right. It is a very difficult and complicated legal issue. Clearly, at one end of an extreme spectrum we do not want to have a situation where virtually the whole of an offence is committed, caused or provoked by a police officer, undercover or overt, in order to obtain a conviction. Equally, at the other end of the spectrum we do not want to see obvious wrongdoers getting off scot-free because of some technical exclusion of a piece of evidence because it is seen to be entrapment. The view that the Australian courts have adopted generally on this issue has been reasonably balanced and accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty in the Ridgeway case, on my understanding of the facts, is that, had the police not intervened, the crime could not have happened. The reason it could not have happened was that the co-conspirator was a police informer and his role was essential to the commission of the crime because he was to obtain the heroin overseas and bring it into Australia. So, without the intervention of the police, the offence concerned would not have been possible; it could not have happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an analogy, if you want to look at this from another angle, consider these circumstances for argument's sake. Suppose I express an interest in committing a bank robbery and the police then say, `Well, okay, we'll give you a gun, we'll provide you with a getaway vehicle and here's a map of the layout of the bank; we'll give you a bit of help to make sure that we can then get there and bust you for that particular crime.' Obviously people would be extremely unhappy if the police were engaging in that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a serious public policy question here: to what extent should the police intervene in such a way that, even if there were to be an apprehension at the end of the process, their intervention actually causes something to happen which otherwise would not have happened? The critical test or issue in providing a cover for police to conduct illegal acts is that question of whether or not the offence still would have occurred. There is an old problem in criminal law with these types of things: at what point do you intervene? The equivalent problem, for example, may be found in the law of attempts: the issue of impossibility. The most classic illustration of that is the fact that you cannot charge with murder somebody who stabs a corpse because, even though they clearly have intended to kill the person, it was impossible to do so because they were already dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation is read broadly and is intended to cover the specific situation that prevailed in the Ridgeway case, then the criminal offence which would never have occurred will, in effect, be extended as a result of police intervention to actual eventuation. There is a critical issue involved in this, and that is in what circumstances where you have little more than an expressed intent and, ultimately, what otherwise would have been a frustrated attempt to bring that intent into actuality should police intervene to ensure that the crime actually happens so that the perpetrators can then be apprehended? It is not clear in my mind how far the bill goes and whether it really does cover this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15M(b) specifies that an authorisation certificate can only be given where:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the person about whom it is intended to obtain evidence through the operation is likely to commit an offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 or an associated offence whether or not the operation takes place . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The critical question is: does this mean any offence of this type or does it mean this particular offence? Using the heroin importation example, does it mean that in order for this certification to apply the police have to convince the commissioner, deputy commissioner or whomever that, even if they do not intervene, this particular contemplated offence will still happen? Or does it mean that all they have to do is convince the commissioner et cetera that, even if this particular offence will not happen, an offence of this nature will happen at some future time? In other words, the person concerned is clearly somebody who has a long-term agenda of importing heroin and, if this scheme does not come off, they will be back in a few months with another scheme with somebody else doing roughly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If read broadly, this provision would ultimately, in my view, lead to prosecuting people in effect for exhibiting a propensity to commit a criminal offence. In other words, by initiating one attempt to import heroin which otherwise clearly would have failed at first base, that person has demonstrated a propensity to engage in that sort of criminal behaviour. Therefore, what the police will do is conduct a pre-emptive strike, intervene, to make sure that what otherwise would have failed will actually happen in the case of the original scheme, and they will then apprehend, charge and convict the person concerned on the basis that, if they had not done so, the person would have gone ahead and attempted to do that sort of thing at some other time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we have to ask ourselves in this issue is: how far should this extend; to what extent should police take the role of flushing out likely offenders? If you have lost your licence, for example, and have been placed on a bond which includes a requirement not to drink, would it be appropriate for the local cop to go down the pub with you and shout you a few beers to try to get you to break your bond so that he or she could then go to the magistrates court and say, `Well, look, they've broken their bond, they shouldn't be allowed back in a car.' This goes dangerously close to deeming criminality and then orchestrating events to produce the anticipated criminal outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, clause 15M(b) is read narrowly, then it is a different and much more appropriate story. But we should remember that if it is read narrowly then, in my view, the facts in the Ridgeway case are not covered&mdash;that in that particular situation, a certificate would not be available. The explanatory memorandum, which is attached to the legislation, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the authorising officer must be satisfied that the suspected criminal activity to which the investigation relates would have taken place without the involvement of law enforcement officials.</PARA>
<PARA>That to me suggests that the narrower interpretation of that particular limb of the test is probably the correct one. I suspect that this ambiguity will probably end up in the High Court as subsequent litigation of the Ridgeway situation. But if it is the narrow limb that is involved and, in effect, the whole scheme of controlled operations has effectively been wiped out by the Ridgeway decision, and the government is endeavouring to resume that scheme but not specifically to target the Ridgeway type situation, then I have no problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue where I have a concern about this, particularly if the broad interpretation of that provision will apply, is the question of police corruption. Obviously none of us needs to say very much about this issue; it is a substantial problem not only in this country but in many other countries. There is a big risk that, by extending to the police the scope of controlled operations to include exclusive control over virtually the entire process of drug importation, a number of opportunities for corruption will be opened up. For example, when drugs are purchased, particularly overseas, a police officer may decide to siphon off some of the purchased drugs, falsify the amount purchased and then sell the difference and continue with the controlled operation. They could set up a drug running operation under the cover of such operations. They could even go into collusion with an alleged suspect in order to run such an operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the current New South Wales inquiry indicates, police corruption is a major problem and it is vital that we pursue prevention strategies as well as retribution strategies in dealing with police corruption. This means police being well trained, well paid, under independent scrutiny, and also having appropriate powers which do not unnecessarily create opportunities or temptations for police corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is on the broader issue, which ultimately is the cause of this situation being a problem for the government in the first place&mdash;and that is, the so-called war on drugs. This is yet another example of long established principles of criminal law being altered in order to fit with the imperatives of the so-called war on drugs&mdash;the prohibition framework to try to stamp out the use of illicit drugs in our society. It is not the only circumstance in which those sorts of changes occur&mdash;motor vehicles is the other prominent area&mdash;but it is still the major area of perversion of the criminal law. A classic example of that is the issue of deeming of trafficable quantities so that the onus of proof is reversed: if you have a certain quantity of a particular drug in your possession, you are deemed to be trafficking, unless you can prove otherwise&mdash;a clear perversion of a basic principle of the criminal law which is there for very practical reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to come to terms with the fact that the prohibition model has failed and that it has produced massive organised crime problems and substantially increased police corruption. The major problems of drug abuse tend to have a connection with the prohibition model&mdash;impurities and variable quality&mdash;and also widespread middle-level and petty crime, robberies and things of that nature to fund the very high prices that a black market in drugs produces. There are enormous costs to the government through policing and to the real economy, the legal economy, because of the diversion of huge amounts of consumer dollars out of the real economy into the black economy to buy drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are signs in the community&mdash;including those coming from the other side of politics, which I applaud&mdash;that a rethink is occurring. I certainly applaud the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for his recent decision with respect to the reduction in the criminalisation of cannabis and the Chief Minister of the ACT for the proposals with respect to controlled heroin use trials. Various other figures in the coalition, I think, have been quite courageous in adopting some strong positions on this. I also applaud the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for taking some very constructive and worthwhile positions on these issues as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, this will be a test of our maturity as a community and as political parties. Unfortunately, in this House it seems to be very difficult to talk about drugs without getting either redneck knee-jerk reactions or sniggering schoolboy reactions. Every time in question time there is even any vague sense of marijuana being mentioned you get the sort of public schoolboy sniggers bursting out all over the place&mdash;and not only on the other side. It is long overdue that we tackle these issues in a serious way. They are major problems in our community in a lot of respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not favour full legalisation. If we allowed the advertising industry to get its hands on many of the drugs that are currently illegal, consumption would increase, which would be a problem. Somewhere between the current war on drugs and the prohibition model, which clearly has not worked and is causing enormous problems, at one extreme and full legalisation at the other is an appropriate model which ensures that we can tackle the health problems, minimise consumption&mdash;not criminate people for basic things that affect only them and hurt only them&mdash;and also get rid of some of the outrageous problems we have with organised crime and the massive costs to the community. I would certainly urge members on the other side to give serious consideration to this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995 has my full support in spirit. I hope that members on both sides of the House will work as hard as possible to ensure that legislation is agreed upon and put in place urgently. I say that for a number of reasons, and I will try to keep them simple and short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason is that the illegal drug trade is an insidious evil trade. No-one would dispute that. The second reason is that it has destroyed and is destroying many lives and has had a serious impact on many areas of society in the world, including in Australia&mdash;thankfully, not so much in Australia but, as far as we know, it is still a very serious problem in certain quarters. We must never close our eyes to that. We must never relax in respect of that. We are aware that in some countries the illegal drug trade has been used for political purposes&mdash;for example, in connection with the transportation of illegal drugs from South America to the United States&mdash;and is used for political purposes with a view to fomenting disruption in society and for other agendas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to make is that the police force often works in very dangerous circumstances to try to stop the illegal drug trade. It is a fact of life that members of the police force work under cover in certain circumstances, in very dangerous circumstances, and sometimes their lives are lost as a result of their working in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fact that since the Ridgeway case, as I understand it, a number of very serious charges have been laid and trials are to proceed against people who allegedly have been involved in the illegal transportation into Australia of drugs of substantial quantity. If legislation is not agreed upon in this parliament quickly, it is possible that those trials may not proceed and that people who are alleged to have committed serious crimes, if the evidence is there to establish those crimes, will walk free. So let us keep that in context. That is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, obviously, is very keen to see the law clarified and appropriate procedures put on the statute books to enable the fight against this evil, abominable criminal activity to continue and to succeed. That is the issue. Therefore, it should be possible for us to work together to resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the legislation has in it a procedure which is designed to enable police to enter into undercover operations, if I may call them that, in order that the necessary evidence eventually is available on the arrival of the drugs into this country. I might be oversimplifying it, but that is roughly the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there is a divergence of views among some members as to the procedures that need to be undertaken in order that all the necessary safety controls and measures are available as far as is reasonably possible to achieve by legislation. It is always very difficult in legislation to dot every `i' and to get it right, but goodwill should be the paramount factor between us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and the shadow minister for social security, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), on behalf of the coalition, have foreshadowed that we would like this legislation to be quickly referred to an appropriate all-party committee of this House in order that the legislation can be quickly assessed and certain concerns discussed, with a view to coming in with a very urgent report so that the parliament can then resume the debate and get on with passing the legislation. Then it can go into the other house, having gone through this House, with whatever changes have been achieved, I am sure, with bipartisan cooperation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The comments made by honourable members, including the last speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), can also be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr Cleeland</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anything for a reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I for one would be particularly interested to hear the comments of the member for McEwen, who will speak after me, because of his unique position as the chair of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. So I see a valuable process being open to us, and I think it is very important that that process be facilitated as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I also say that I honestly do not think&mdash;and it seems that it is not an issue any longer with anyone in this House anyway&mdash;that this legislation is retrospective legislation. The offence of importation of drugs that are illegal is not in any shape or form altered by this legislation. For those people in the 10 or so cases in Australia that I understand are awaiting trial, the offence that they are charged with is in no shape or form altered by this legislation. So I see no retrospective alteration to the nature of the offence. If it were retrospective, then all of us would be wringing our hands because of the concern that we have, in the system of justice that we all support, that retrospective legislation creating a criminal offence in that area is to be resisted unless there is the most overpowering evidence. Thankfully, we are not being asked to consider that. I do not look forward to the day when we are, quite frankly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation attempts to put into statute law an appropriate authorised controlled operation procedure that is a step in the way in which the criminal enforcement agencies can cope with the insidious criminal activity that we know exists in the world. It is in that area that I have noted the comments of other members and the concern of the member for Melbourne about the involvement of judicial oversight. I for one at this stage, subject to the consultation and advice and input that would come from a parliamentary committee, lean towards having judicial function because of a number of factors. I will spell those out now, but not exhaustively, just to give an indication of some of the areas that I am attracted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, regrettably, the present operation of police enforcement in the drug area of Australia is subject to very serious public concern. Without in any way wishing to pre-empt the New South Wales royal commission into the New South Wales police force and certain activities, it is a matter of grave concern that we see evidence being reported in that commission involving, allegedly, a large number of serving officers of the police force in New South Wales and the alleged acceptance and payment of bribes in connection with the trafficking of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, one alarming piece of evidence has alleged that, as a consequence of an officer being killed in the line of duty in the drug enforcement area&mdash;I choose my words carefully because I do not want to transgress the orders of the House in respect of royal commissions&mdash;the officers investigating the murder of the investigating police officer were allegedly persuaded by bribes to abandon those investigations. I cannot think of anything more stark or frightening than that sort of allegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not in any way wish to reflect on the integrity or the efficiency of the federal commissioner, who I think it is proposed in this bill will be the one responsible to deal with the proposed authorised controlled operation procedures. I do not do that. I know honourable members will understand that I am not doing that. I am talking generally about the community concern and perception that exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot prove this, because I have not actually asked any serving officer of the police force about this, but I have a gut feeling that good, honest police officers&mdash;and there are many of them, thank goodness&mdash;in the state and federal police forces of Australia would welcome this parliament spending a bit more time, through a joint parliamentary committee, to scrutinise the authorised control operation proposals and would welcome the suggestion that there be judicial involvement and even perhaps that some evidence be taken as a matter of urgency at the committee level from officers who are serving in this area by asking them what they think. I have a gut feeling that a good, honest police officer involved in this war against those who are involved in bringing these drugs into Australia would welcome the appropriate mechanisms involving judicial function oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are problems with it. I know that some schools of thought advance the view that judges increasingly involved in this function take on an administrative role and that that is not their role. As a lawyer, I do not want to see anything occur at all which undermines the judiciary or in any way makes it more difficult for it. Above all, I would like to see that the separate functions of the judiciary are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact of life that the issuing of warrants&mdash;to use a simple example&mdash;is part of the legal process and is sanctioned by judiciary. The permission to issue a warrant is often obtained as a result of a judge or a magistrate being involved at the first level. Under the telecommunications interceptor law, as the member for Tangney has outlined, there is involvement of the judicial function in connection with gaining the right to intercept telecommunications signals. Of course, that right is an invasion of privacy, and judicial involvement is accepted as necessary because of this parliament's concern about the right to privacy, the fact that it is precious and it is not to be interfered with lightly. If it is to be interfered with, then let us make sure that it is done with great care and only where there is satisfactory oversight at the first level anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation appears to involve those who are involved in the law enforcement side, who are then involved in the very delicate setting up of operations&mdash;undercover and overseas operations and with undercover people&mdash;being satisfied amongst themselves that the process should be authorised. It seems to me&mdash;again, I am oversimplifying it; never mind, I think I am right&mdash;that a joint committee of this parliament should have a look at that to see whether it is desirable to allow, if I may say, Caesar to Caesar type operations&mdash;that is, the initiation, the authorisation and the supervision&mdash;or whether to add to the strength of the whole procedure and to provide necessary safeguards to have some judicial function at that level, because of the benefits that that judicial function would bring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the judicial issue can also be tested at the joint committee level, and it may be that one of the judges could give evidence to guide the committee in matters as important as this. So for that reason, firstly, I hope the legislation can be enacted quickly&mdash;I think it is urgent legislation&mdash;and, secondly, I urge the minister to consider the suggestion of the coalition that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs be asked to urgently report on it. I realise that if the minister does not accept that then the matter will go to the Senate and, without wishing to pre-empt what our colleagues in the Senate will do, it is pretty clear that the Senate would carry out its own investigation and refer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure about the workload of the Senate committees; I have heard of these magical Friday committees, and I understand that the Senate Friday committees are very burdened with work at the moment. I think that we really ought to have a joint discussion; I have said this before when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and we did an inquiry into labelling here and reported. Then the Senate had its own inquiry into the same legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said what a pity it is that in this House in 1995 we have got this rather odd, strange situation where the two houses cannot meet informally to decide whether it is necessary to have two committees to look at the same piece of legislation. Why can't we set up a joint committee, by motion of either house, initially, to look at the legislation for both houses, rather than have the process of two? That is not in any way to diminish the work of the Senate. I support the work of the Senate. But it seems to me that we could get a little bit more with it, streamline the procedures and have in place a situation that would enable the ministers, such as in this case, to deal with their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, as I read it, both sides of the House want the legislation to go through quickly. Both sides of the House have got some concerns about the legislation. Both sides of the House seem to be agreeing that an examination by a committee is appropriate provided it is done quickly. This side of the House says, `Why not do it by a House of Representatives committee because it can be done speedily?' I think the government minister has said, `No. Do it in the Senate because the Senate will want the inquiry anyway and, if you do it here, the Senate will still want its own inquiry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were the Prime Minister for the day&mdash;heaven forbid!&mdash;I would adjourn the debate for half an hour and call in the minister, the shadow ministers and the leaders in both houses and say, `Right, within half an hour, I want you to resolve this. I want one joint committee or one committee to deal with this situation, and I want you to decide which one it is going to be.' Then I would go back and inform you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;I hope you are still presiding&mdash;that we had reached an agreement. Then we could get on with the job and do what we should be doing&mdash;that is, bringing in legislation quickly and accommodating the police and the prosecutors, who must be terribly concerned about this hiatus that exists as a result of the Ridgeway case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And for ordinary John Citizen&mdash;imagine the anger and concern of the ordinary citizens of Australia when they hear that 10 people, who might be guilty, are facing alleged serious offences and trials in Australia and they might walk free because this house of parliament and the Senate could not quickly deal with the matter&mdash;they both agree on it; it is only a matter of the detail. I hope that something will happen quickly. If it does not, we will persevere. The coalition wants to help the government get this thing right. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="72" SPEAKER="Cleeland Mr P.R." NAMEID="KF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MCEWEN" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME><ELECTORATE>(McEwen)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (6.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you would think, listening to members in this House debating the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1995, that we have a large document in front of us with lots of words and lots of complex issues to be resolved. It is 10 pages long. It is a small bill. It is in language which even non-lawyers could read and understand without difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It introduces the concept of a controlled operation in proposed section 15H. It has only three subsections in the definitional part which applies to section 3(1) of the Crimes Act and it is not very complex. Yet we have heard a whole lot of reasons why it should be delayed and a committee should examine it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the arguments for delay seem to be based on a proposition that, rather than a serving police officer with senior rank authorising a controlled operation, it should be a judicial function. It is seen by some members as similar to the issue of a warrant for search, arrest, or telephone intercept under the telephone interception provisions, yet it is not. We are talking about an administrative, not a judicial, function. It is an operational function, not a judicial function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Warrants are issued by courts because they involve the taking away of liberty of individuals. They involve a judicial decision to take away those rights to allow a police officer to do something which is unlawful without the warrant because of the privacy or private rights of the individual. Police officers of senior rank make operational decisions on a daily basis without recourse to judges or magistrates. They are fundamentally very different matters. Indeed, there are arguments for the fact that, should it be the will of the House that it be a judicial function to authorise operations known as controlled operations, it could well be a breach of the separation of powers because it involves two totally different functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect I draw the attention of the House to a 1994 Federal Court decision in the case of Grollo v Bates, reported in 125 Australian Law Reports at page 492, where Justice Einfeld held that certain functions conferred on judges and magistrates by Commonwealth legislation are administrative and not judicial. He held that those functions could not validly be exercised by judges or magistrates because of the separation of powers required by the Commonwealth constitution. The provision in question was a Victorian provision allowing the extension of time for which a suspect could be held prior to Commonwealth investigation under Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a simple answer to say that we should refer this matter to a committee so that it can look at whether a warrant should be issued by a judicial person before a controlled operation can take place. There is a case right on that point already in the law reports and, to me at least, there are some major complications in going down that track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other things that maybe only those of us who have had the privilege of serving in the police force can say about this type of operation, and that is that the bulk of crime is detected and convictions secured by the use of information obtained other than by brilliant detective work. Very few major cases appear before the court because the police are brilliant detectives. Major prosecutions and convictions occur because there is an informer somewhere who leaks information to police officers, who then set up an operation to drag in the evidence based on the information provided and get the brief together to secure a conviction. The bulk of policing occurs like that. They are operational decisions and operational matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bulk of convictions secured on major importations of drugs into Australia are achieved because of information received from our overseas posts. Australian Federal Police officers in listening posts around the world, cooperating with overseas police forces and sharing intelligence, hear of operations to import into Australia. But, unless they can operate to allow that transaction to take place, they will never get the people into Australia and be able to charge them before Australian courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not much use, frankly, stopping operations in some countries where the intelligence is gathered, because you can buy your way out of those situations in most of the drug source countries. It would seem to be much more satisfactory, if we are really going to do something about this major drug trade, to get the offenders into Australia and make sure they are properly dealt with by decent laws and go where they belong&mdash;into Australian gaols. You have to understand that that is the way it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Christmas I spent some time in the United States looking at organised crime and that country's position on crime. I met with a number of Australian police officers who work from our embassies in the United States and I met with many major US police bodies, including the FBI and the DEA. I spent an engrossing four weeks looking at the American situation and the problems it faces with drug importations. This House also has to understand that we are not dealing with amateurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the importation of drugs around the world is controlled by a very intelligent corporate-type organisation. The methods being devised to get through Customs and the very tight controls the world is getting over target countries are very sophisticated. Some of them are so sophisticated that I do not want to talk about them in this House and tell people just how easy it is with the sophistication now available to breach the Customs barriers. If we are going to be successful, if we are going to be really serious about getting these people and slowing down the trade&mdash;in my view, it is impossible to slow down because the profits are too high&mdash;and making any dent at all on the trade, we will have to be as devious and clever as they are. We will have to be more so, if possible, if we are going to get them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about kids committing street offences; we are talking about the second largest trade in the world. It ranks with the defence trade, which is huge. It is a multibillion US dollars business. The profits are enormous. You could go to Bangkok tomorrow and it would not be difficult to buy one kilo of No. 4 heroin, pure white, the highest grade you can buy on overseas markets. Its price varies but with anywhere between $10,000 and $12,000, given the state of the market and supply at the time, you can buy yourself a kilo of pure heroin. If you can get it past the borders and into this country, you have got yourself $250,000 in cash. That is the market we are talking about. No matter what laws we pass there are people who will try to get $12,000 converted into $250,000 tax free in cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our laws just have to get cleverer. We have to do things which might go against the grain for civil libertarians and which otherwise I would not agree with. But, when you look at this measure, which really is not much of a breach of individual liberties, you must remember that we are talking about people who are intending to import into Australia a drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation permits a police officer, properly authorised by senior command, to assist in a surreptitious way an already determined activity to import into Australia in order to ensure that evidence of importation is obtained by the police so that, one, the drug does not get into the marketplace and, two, the offenders are put before a court with the evidence necessary to convict them. This legislation operationally allows the police force to set up a sting, as the Americans would call it. It is not entrapment because the offenders already have the intention to import. There is nothing complicated about it. It is simple legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is easy enough to say that we can refer it to a committee. I listened with interest to the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) talk about what he would do if he were Prime Minister for a day. He would get the minister, he would put them all together and he would get the Senate to agree. You only have to read what the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Evans, says. I do not think you could ever expect any agreement out of the Senate on anything to do with this House. So joint committees set up so quickly are an impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it goes to other committees, you are simply delaying the passage of the bill for no legal or sensible reason, as much as you say otherwise. As has been clearly demonstrated with Grollo's case, it is a no-no. So I do not accept in any way, shape or form that there is a legitimate reason presented so far to this House why a committee should be put up to look at the legislation when any member of this House can go and read Grollo's case, have a good look at the law for themselves, come back and vote and support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing we should look at is the matter raised by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Like the member for Melbourne, I have long been a member involved in trying to get more sense into the whole drug debate in this country. The member for Melbourne and I agree on this particular area. My view is clear: until we take a pragmatic, sensible approach about the illegal drug market in Australia, we are not going to solve the problem. The reality is that any person who wants to buy an illegal drug in Australia can do so. I do not care how many laws this parliament or a state parliament passes, they are not going to change that very simple fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been 40-odd years or more since the UN, through American pressure, forced the rest of the world into creating an illegal drug regime on drugs which were once not unlawful. Up until 1953, I think it was, heroin was not unlawful in this country&mdash;a drug which was widely used in childbirth; a drug which has an enormous number of human factors to it. For example, we deny terminally ill cancer patients access to one of the best analgesics known in the world. We are saying in Australia, `So what? Put up with the pain,' because some people use it unlawfully. I cannot wear that argument. I find that a nonsense argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the experience I have had and the years I have spent on the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have come to the conclusion that we are talking about a social health problem. Those who use illegal drugs have a health problem&mdash;no more or less than an alcoholic and no more or less than those people who are addicted to legal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not forget in this House that the biggest drug problem in Australia is the abuse of prescribed drugs. There are more people addicted to tryptanol, serepax, valium, rohypnols and mogodons. More people present themselves to casualty centres in Australian hospitals because of poly-drug abuse of the legal drugs than because of illegal drugs. We treat those people as a health problem, quite properly; yet if you happen to use cocaine or heroin you are a criminal. The logic escapes me. It is a matter which we really have to talk seriously about in this country, because until we get to the stage of removing the demand we will never control supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say to this House that my experience in looking at this problem around the world has been very simple. The Americans have spent billions of dollars. They have gone down to South America with the CIA, they have used aeroplanes and they have had operations of dubious legality in trying to stop the problem. They have failed. There is as much cocaine in the world today as there has ever been and the growth of the product is growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that in South America today the Cali cartel people, the Columbians, the Peruvians, the Chilians and now the Mexicans are growing heroin as well. There is a new source of heroin coming into the United States, which is one of the problems we now see in Australia. There is an oversupply of heroin. Our young users of heroin are getting purer doses and overdosing and they are dying. That is our fault. We should all take the blame for what is occurring in the street. The fact is that in South America heroin is now being grown, is coming into the market and is competing with the Asian and the Pakistani heroin growers, so the price is dropping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard about a horrible reality when I was in the United States. The San Francisco narcotics squad were telling me that they had a seizer of cocaine in San Francisco several years ago. They seized six tonnes of pure cocaine&mdash;six tonnes! The mind boggles. They thought they had a great success, a major breakthrough. They had got six tonnes of pure cocaine. So they watched the street prices, which is the only way to measure the success in these areas, and the street price of cocaine did not vary; it did not blip. In other words, the supply of cocaine was greater than the six tonnes they got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that does not tell us something about the nature and the size of this trade, then it does not tell us anything. So we have to be clever, and I really want to get these people. Whilst I want to see changes on the street and treat people who use drugs as a so-called health problem, not a criminal problem, it does not mean to say that we need to stop the attack on international organised criminality, which the drug trade now is and which corrupts right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the issues about corruption that the member for Melbourne raised. He said that one of his concerns was that if you have controlled operations there is the potential for police corruption. He said that that could allow police to siphon off part of the shipment and it could allow police to use a controlled operation to be importers of illegal drugs in their own right. They can do that now. This legislation will not make that any easier or any more difficult than it is now for any corrupt police officer in this country to do. You can get a corrupt Customs person and a corrupt cop and you can do it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not going to create corruption by itself. Corruption is created because of the nature of the trade. As I said, you can go to Thailand and for $12,000 buy yourself a kilo of No. 4. You can ship it in and make a quarter of a million bucks. That is where the corruption comes from, not because of this sort of legislation. As long as people can do that, there is going to be corruption. We ought to admit that and understand that that is the problem we face with corruption&mdash;the sheer profit, the sheer greed of the people who are involved in this trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened carefully. I have heard nothing, frankly, that convinces me that this House should not pass the legislation now. I have heard no reason why this House should not pass the legislation rather than try to defer it to a committee which will be told about the Grollo case and which will be told that there are difficulties in separating administrative and judicial functions. They will agree and it will come back to this House. It will be a waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this House cannot control what the Senate does. We cannot control the views of Mr Evans, as much as I wish I could. There are those in the Senate who believe that they are the functioning house, that they can have as many committees as they like and that they can delay the government's legislation. That is a fact of life that this House has to live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Senate committees are chock-a-block with reports. The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority suffers because we cannot get senators to it. There is not one joint committee at the moment in this place that is not suffering because senators are overworked. There is nothing I can do about that and there is nothing we in this House can do to make the Senate become more efficient in the way it processes legislation. Having an inquiry on this legislation in this place will not help, because the Senate will still do what it wants to do, no matter what we do in this House. Even if we do have an inquiry, the Senate will still have its own inquiry because the Democrats and the Greens are all trying to be important in functions and the National-Liberal Party coalition is trying to play its own politics with the Democrats and the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us get the legislation through. Let us not let those people who are currently awaiting hearings before a court on controlled importations into Australia off the hook. The longer we delay, the greater the risk that these people will not face justice in the courts. The longer we wait, the greater the risks are that nolle prosequis will be issued. I have heard nothing in this debate today to convince me of any logical or legal reason why we should delay the passage of this bill. I urge the House to do the right thing and get it up to the Senate as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions in the debate on the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill. There are a number of points which have been raised, and I should respond to a number of those. Firstly, there is the question of retrospectivity. I am happy that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has put that in a proper context. The bill does not impose any retrospective criminal liability. The rationale for the principle that laws should not be retrospective is that a citizen should be entitled to rely on the law as it stands so that they can conduct their affairs accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis there is nothing repugnant about this bill, unless it is supposed that narcotics traffickers were entitled to assume that they could import narcotics without being prosecuted. The transitional provisions have been drafted as narrowly as possible without jeopardising the 10 outstanding prosecutions which rely on evidence obtained as a result of an importation which would otherwise not be able to be established on the Ridgeway principles. The transitional provisions apply to only future cases. Cases in which a court has already decided to exclude evidence are not affected. Without the transitional provisions, the evidence available to prosecute a number of pending cases relating to allegations of serious narcotics trafficking offences will be in serious jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also should discuss briefly the issue of judicial authorisation. There has been some discussion regarding the view that operations should be authorised by the court. This bill has been structured, in my view, to appropriately balance broad questions about law enforcement, accountability, preventing abusive powers by police and maintaining the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the decision in a specific case regarding an authorisation of a police operation, that is a quite different matter than the issuing of a search, arrest or telecommunications interception warrant. In those latter cases, an individual's liberties are being balanced against the interests of the community as a whole. Their house is being searched, their liberty restricted or their conversation recorded. In other words, there is a balancing operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a controlled operation, there is no civil liberty to import narcotics free of police involvement. The decision whether to authorise an operation rests on an assessment of the likely effectiveness and security of the operation and a judgment about whether or not that person would be likely to have pursued that course irrespective of the operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are essentially operational questions and require judgments addressing the whole issue of what resources are available to law enforcement and the capacity of that operation to protect the community as a whole from any diversion. All those issues are ones which are simply not appropriate to pass from the person who has the correct responsibility of making a judgment to a court official. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to have a system in which responsibility rests with the person who takes a decision. When it comes to whether or not a particular police operation is to be commenced, the decision is one in which we would expect the blame for any failure to be attached to that person responsible for taking the decision. It is hardly appropriate to place such law enforcement possibilities into the hands of courts, which are essentially charged with an adjudicative function rather than a function of operating as part of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason and the issue of the separation of powers, there are real constitutional reasons why operations should not be authorised by judges and magistrates. Courts have made it clear that it is contrary to the separation of powers and hence constitutionally invalid for judges and magistrates to perform administrative functions. Already in the Grollo and Bates litigation the Commonwealth's reliance on Victorian provisions that required a magistrate's authorisation to extend a period of a suspect's detention have been held invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far the Commonwealth has managed to steer around these constitutional problems. We have done that by conferring on persons, as persona designata, powers of this administrative nature on persons who also hold judicial office. But the powers in this bill, were they to be conferred on a court, would move very substantially further from traditional notions of judicial function than any previously conferred on judges. It is quite possible that they would cross the line, delimiting the kinds of functions that judges might validly exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one final point on this issue. There has been a tendency in Australian law enforcement to load functions onto judges and magistrates. Judges and magistrates in both state and federal courts have bitterly complained about the workload that this has created and that they are becoming law enforcement adjudicators instead of judicial officers. At best there would be lengthy delays in securing the agreement from states and territories to allow their judges to perform these functions. In the interim, federal judges would face a significant workload in this area if it is appropriate as a matter of principle to confer that responsibility on the court. I simply do not believe that that is a desirable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to decision making criteria, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has suggested two additional decision making criteria. The first is that an operation should be a last resort where other methods of investigation are not open. The second is that the seriousness of the offence should be taken into account. The first point is already covered by the bill. Proposed section 15M will require that the authorising officer be satisfied that the operation will `make it much easier to obtain evidence' leading to the prosecution of a Commonwealth narcotics offence. In other words, where other methods of obtaining evidence are reasonably available the legislation will not facilitate a controlled operation to be authorised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the suggestion that the seriousness of the offence be taken into account, an operation can be performed only to obtain evidence of a narcotics trafficking offence against section 233B of the Customs Act 1901, or aiding and abetting, attempting, inciting or conspiring to commit such an offence. In a rare case where the trafficking concerns a very small quantity of narcotic goods, it is hard to see what incentive there would be for law enforcement officers to devote to a minor instance substantial resources that would be required. That is particularly true given that senior officers whose authorisation is required are also responsible for making the most of the law enforcement budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say too in respect of the argument that safeguards have not been adequately built into this legislation, I think it is instructive to contrast this legislation with that passed by the South Australian parliament and introduced by the South Australian Liberal government. Any person who suggests that this bill is not hedged with an appropriate regard to the matters that are appropriate by way of safeguards needs only look to the South Australian legislation to see a manner of addressing the Ridgeway decision, which builds in remarkably fewer safeguards&mdash;indeed, none of those which have been counselled by members in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I just mention a couple of other points. The issue of risk for arrest by state police has been raised. I would say to the member for Tangney that we are seeking to continue the close coordination between state and federal agencies in a wide range of matters. Controlled operations have existed a number of times under the administrative arrangements which were thought to authorise them adequately in the past. Cooperation between state and federal agencies will be necessary, as again they have always been. I would add, however, that the bill will make one significant difference: in an instance where an authorisation has been granted under this scheme there will be a clear and available certificate which will demonstrate on officer's bona fides in the unlikely event that an officer is arrested in some other jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the issue of the committee: I do accept that it is inevitable that this matter will go before a parliamentary committee. I believe, however, that it is in the interests of this parliament that we move it through this process quickly and now. The government has given this bill category T status, which means the most urgent status which legislation can be given in the parliament, in view of the significance of the issue and the importance of it being passed by the House and the Senate as rapidly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of substantial interest in this legislation in the Senate. I understand that interest is not confined to the coalition parties and is also an interest which is held by the Australian Democrats and other members of that chamber. In that circumstance, it seems to me not improbable that whatever course was adopted in this case the Senate might revisit the issues. It seems to me, given the need for this matter to be dealt with as a matter of genuine urgency, it is wise to accept the reality that the matter will be addressed in the Senate and proceed in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra ought to be aware of my views in relation to those matters. A similar process has happened in the past where I have indicated to the member for Berowra that, where legislation is timed urgent, I would normally seek an assurance that there will be an undertaking across the Senate that the matter would not be revisited. Whilst that may be the case of the coalition parties, I have certainly not had it in a general sense that would extend to an undertaking that the Senate would not revisit it in those circumstances. Whilst I will not decline leave for the member for Berowra to move the motion that he proposes, we will be voting against it. </PARA>

<PARA>I will not detain the House by reiterating my arguments again, save to say that I have not been persuaded. I encourage the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to read the thoughtful speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) on his side in relation to the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill because it raised some additional matters that I had not covered. I thought it demonstrated the nature of the submissions that might well be received on this legislation. I accept that there may be a basis for argument on some of the issues that I pressed, even though you did not persuade me. I was particularly interested in the honourable member for Melbourne's comments because they were not picked up in your comments by your advisers. They put a new dimension on it and showed the way in which members of this House can contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am not in a position to say that the Senate would not revisit the matter, I can certainly say that, so far as my colleagues are concerned, our view was that an inquiry by a committee of this chamber of the parliament would suffice. I recognise that there may well have been views by others in other parties over whom we have no influence, but it would certainly give great credit, particularly to the House of Representatives, if the government was prepared to acknowledge that good work can be done in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the legislation dealing with paedophiles that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considerably improved the government's bill. My recollection is that the Senate did not seek to revisit that particular legislation after it had been improved. I would certainly counsel the government, even at this late stage, to reconsider its position and support the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone), who is in the other place, indicated that, even though we appreciate the urgency that the government attaches to the Senate, the Senate committee does have a very heavy workload. It was more likely that a prompt consideration would be possible in this place. While we would not be seeking to impose any capricious delay in the Senate, the workload it has is more likely to lead to a delay that the government says it does not want than if we were to proceed with the matter before this House's committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). Firstly, I do accept that this House and its committees can play a very valuable role. I think the legislation that I as minister referred to the committee is the first instance in the history of this parliament under the new standing committee arrangements where that did occur, and I think it can work very well. I simply reiterate that where a time limited matter of some urgency is before the parliament and where there can be no assurances that the Democrats will not raise this issue and where there is an arrangement known to the government where either the Democrats or the coalition parties seek to have a reference to a Senate committee, that will be supported by the other parties unless we do have an assurance that we will not be duplicating a hearing process, both in the committee of the House and in the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All public opinion polls on issues of public moment indicate very clearly that law and order is an issue of very high priority with the general public. More and more people are becoming victims of crime, in particular of break and enter offences. Only those who have experienced this can know the anguish it causes. In the case of my own electorate, which has a large number of elderly people, I have heard stories where the consequence of break and enter of an elderly person's home has been nervous breakdown, subsequent admission to a nursing home and, effectively, the end of that person's life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Homes have become fortresses, and it is insurance company requirements that have partly caused this. It is very common for insurance companies to require that all doors have deadlocks, that all windows have security screens, as well as other similar requirements before they will renew insurance policies on homes. The fact that these may enhance a building's safety from break and enter but reduce personal safety from fire is something that nobody seems to be prepared to come to terms with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, there has been a growing fear in the community on the subject of home invasion. In Queensland, within the last few days, we have all learned of a horrendous crime where a man of 59 was attacked in his own home&mdash;it appears by two people&mdash;and stabbed to death. A few weeks ago an elderly lady in a nursing home was murdered for the contents of her purse&mdash;the princely sum of $20. Whilst these home invasions may be relatively few in number, the great fear that they are invoking in the community is very real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my experience, without a doubt, the greatest deterrent to crime is the fear of being caught. These days there is plenty being said in the newspapers and on the airwaves on the subject of the leniency of the legal and sentencing system. I appreciate that that is not a responsibility of the Commonwealth government. However, I have been dismayed to learn that the Commonwealth government denies cooperation to state law enforcement agencies and is effectively assisting perpetrators of crime. Specifically, suspected offenders for whom an arrest warrant has been issued are sheltered by the Commonwealth government from detection and apprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told by police officers that warrants for arrest have been issued&mdash;for example, in the state of Queensland&mdash;for people who are suspected of multiple offences. These people skip off interstate. It is suspected that they are receiving social welfare. But the Department of Social Security, by not providing the information as to where these people may be living, absolutely denies cooperation to police forces. The police may suspect that offenders are living in a particular state. They may be able to say to the Department of Social Security that they have good reason to believe that these offenders are receiving social welfare benefits and are in a particular state, but the department refuses to give the police addresses for the service of arrest warrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this absolutely incomprehensible, and I think the average honest citizen would do likewise. Surely it must be the ultimate offence to honest, hardworking members of the community who have been victims of crime&mdash;who, for example, have had savings stolen or who have had stolen from them goods they have worked hard to pay for&mdash;to have to pay taxes which provide social welfare benefits for the very people who committed those crimes against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to look at this issue with a high degree of priority. All too often the Commonwealth government says that law and order is an issue that it is not properly involved in&mdash;or, if they are involved, only at the fringe. Surely this issue goes to the heart of the possibility of apprehending, and therefore stopping, criminals. One can surely imagine the lark for these people who must think the rest of the community are fools: not only are these criminals being sheltered behind provisions of an act which were meant to protect innocent people, but they can go on robbing their victims by claiming social welfare, secure in the knowledge that the police force in the state in which they have committed their crimes simply cannot reach them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis on Badu Island, in the Torres Strait in my electorate. In April this year, the first reported cases of illness from Japanese encephalitis were identified on Badu. Three members of the community of Badu presented with this disease. Tragically, two of these people, one a young boy, later passed away as a result of this infection. I extend my condolences to the community and particularly to the families of these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The virus has been isolated from the mosquito Culex annularostris, the common mosquito for this region. The preferred breeding habitat for this mosquito is ponded stagnant water with high organic content&mdash;for example, decaying vegetation or animal or human faeces. A study of the island revealed prolific breeding sites for these mosquitoes, particularly along the esplanade and the foreshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The virus is borne by animals, and pigs are known to be the amplifying hosts with the spread of the disease. All the pigs on Badu Island were identified as carrying the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of a control group of approximately 200 people tested on the island, about 35 were identified as having been infected with the virus&mdash;although only three presented with symptoms. There are about 800 people living on Badu, so as much as a quarter of the population may already have been infected. However, Badu Island is not the only place the disease has been identified in the Torres Strait. All northern islands&mdash;Boigu, Dauan and Saibai&mdash;have had infection in both people and animals. People have been infected in Badu, Mabuiag and Moa, and the disease has been identified in animals on Yorke, Stephen and Darley islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of environmental health determinants that should not be understated in the spread of this disease. Badu Island and the other Torres Strait islands have a unique environmental, social, cultural and economic structure that is found nowhere else in the world where this disease has been identified. Of particular concern is the concentration of vectors&mdash;that is, mosquitoes&mdash;amplifiers&mdash;that is, stagnant water&mdash;and housing and people in small areas confined by beaches and hills. That is exactly the Torres Strait terrain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Badu Island community is built over soils with a high water table. There are indications that this water table is between seven centimetres and 70 centimetres beneath the surface. This is a serious concern for two reasons. Firstly, water ponding within swampy surface areas and within existing defective drains gives rise to numerous breeding sites for mosquitoes. Secondly, this high water table increases the opportunity for surface pollution from household septic tanks and subsequent breeding sites from surface ponding of nutrient-rich water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several septic tanks and effluent disposal systems situated around the community were inspected and found to be defective, also resulting in surface ponding of nutrient-rich breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Irrespective of Japanese encephalitis, this ponding of partially treated human sewage should not be acceptable in the 1990s. There have been a lot of reports and discussion about the lack of infrastructure such as sewerage in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pigs and horses that currently live within the community also present a large problem. Pigs, particularly, produce a large amount of manure and effluent which will promote potential breeding sites during the wet season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is believed that the disease may have first entered the Torres Strait either through birds or on wind-borne mosquitoes from Papua New Guinea. There is no indication at the moment as to when the disease, which appears to be a natural phenomenon, as opposed to an imported problem, will again re-enter the Torres Strait, but the likelihood of the problem recurring during the wet season creates a need for urgent action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the current sittings, I will be speaking to my parliamentary colleagues the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) to assess the level of assistance that can be provided for this medical emergency. The responsibility lies with all levels of government. I know that the Badu Community Council&mdash;and I have spoken to the chairman, Joey Nona, and his deputy, Jack Ahmat&mdash;is willing to help in any way, but the resources of such community councils are limited. </PARA>
<PARA>I must praise the community council for its concern in the matter and its vigilance in raising the problem, which is definitely a concern for Badu and also a concern right throughout the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility for primary and preventive health care clearly lies with the Queensland government, and the Queensland tropical health unit is certainly on the job, but all levels of government will need to act as soon as possible to ensure that the people of Badu do not suffer any more tragedies such as this. The disease has already led to the dreadful loss of two members of this tight-knit community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 March 1995 I wrote to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) concerning allegations in a report, `The hidden cost of fashion', that the use of exploitative outwork was rife in the fashion industry in Australia. The report, commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations, cited a figure of 300,000 outworkers and painted a picture of Dickensian dimensions. Accordingly, I asked the minister to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . investigate the level and extent of sweated outwork, determine whether any government industries were using outworkers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>there were plenty of claims accordingly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and reassess the effects of tariff cuts on the TCF industry.</PARA>
<PARA>It came as no surprise when the minister responded with claims that his data implied that there were around only 30,000 persons employed in outwork and that he did not consider that an independent inquiry would help in dealing with what he described as a complex matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is such a complex matter, why is the state member for Pascoe Vale&mdash;five months after I wrote to the minister and raised the issue in the parliament&mdash;running around the place claiming that TCF outworkers are being exploited, essentially because of the abolition of state awards? I know that the member for Melbourne would not believe that. The reasons are obvious. The facts are that right-wing Labor apologists such as `Toady' Thomson are too scared to point the finger at the federal government and demand an industry policy designed to help the unemployed in the old heartlands with real employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim that exploitative outwork is the product of the abolition of state awards when neither the union nor the minister for industry believes it to be the case is fraudulent. Even Joan Kirner, despite the fact that she was Premier at the time, had enough courage to tell the Keating government that its tariff policies were opening the way for an increase in TCF imports and a decline in employment in that sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funnily enough, the member for Pascoe Vale is the same bloke who, prior to the Wills by-election, was saying privately, as he chewed on my ear, that tariff cuts were a big issue locally and the reason why TCF workers were being retrenched in their droves. It shows what an opportunist the member for Pascoe Vale is and how little he cares for the working people of the northern suburbs. He knows that the real reason why TCF workers are being exploited is that their jobs are diminishing and that the government has failed to provide alternative employment for those who have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that, although TCF exports have increased, imports have increased to record levels and factory based employment has decreased while outwork has increased. If the member for Pascoe Vale is going to be nothing more than an obsequious apologist for free market policies and the excesses of free trade, he has no right to represent working people. I hear the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) saying, `Hear, hear.' Furthermore, if he is so concerned about outwork, why is he not taking up the issue with the federal minister and telling him that his figures of 30,000 are wrong? If the jobs in the TCF are not going to come back, apologists like the member for Pascoe Vale and the right-wingers ought to stop deceiving working people and demand federal policies designed to give people secure work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason Mr Thomson does not take a more critical and objective position on the developments in the TCF sector is that he does not want to raise the ire of the party bosses. In the 1988 state election campaign, Mr Thomson went on record as saying that tariff reductions would only make the industry more competitive. Surprise, surprise! He should try telling that to a retrenched textile worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that he wants to blame Jeff Kennett for unemployment in the TCF sector. It is no wonder that Jeffrey Kennett is the best thing the Labor Party has going for it in Victoria. It is no wonder that Jeff Kennett gets blamed for absolutely everything. I agree with the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) that Jeff Kennett is terrible and shocking and is doing great harm to Victoria&mdash;his Tower of Babel on the Yarra is an absolute disgrace&mdash;but, dear me, the federal Labor Party has to take some responsibility for unemployment in the TCF sector and take some serious responsibility for putting those people back into serious work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise what I consider to be a very dubious use of public money. It involves funds contributed by the Commonwealth government which appear to have been partly used for political purposes by the National Association of Forest Industries. The funds consist of a grant from the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation of $25,000 to NAFI for research on `public perceptions of independent certification', which involves labelling timber with respect to environmental sustainability criteria. With NAFI to provide $23,000, the overall project costs roughly $48,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation are to invest in research which may develop or enhance sustainability, stimulate value adding, enhance market opportunities, improve technology and promote best practice, et cetera. They are all perfectly reasonable. It is funded by an industry levy and $1 from the Commonwealth for every $2 raised from that levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation funds projects on a joint venture basis, usually providing 30 to 60 per cent of the total cost. This project is entitled `independent certification' and is described thus in the corporation's annual operational plan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation is supporting a project to look at the form such a certification system might take to maximise the advantage of the outcomes from the sustainability indicators project. The certification project is being managed through the NAFI Certification Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, thus far, the project has consisted of one major opinion poll on attitudes to forest issues. I have a copy of a report on the outcomes of this poll which was presented to the NAFI board on 16 May. Most of the questions which it refers to are purely broad political questions designed to elicit information to assist NAFI in campaigning against the environment movement. I will give some examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 83 per cent of those questioned said that the government should come out publicly with a balanced forest policy and implement this policy. Some 67 per cent responded that the government should set up an independent inquiry into forest issues headed by a prominent Australian. Some 52 per cent said that most forest management in Australia is better than what happens in other countries. Some 52 per cent said that the Commonwealth government should take over the prime responsibility for forest conservation management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 36 per cent said&mdash;no doubt this is even more alarming for NAFI&mdash;that environmental groups should be given the responsibility of managing Australia's forests. Perhaps those last two responses give some indication as to why the results of this opinion poll have not to the best of my knowledge been publicly released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `research and development' in the act allows funding to be spent on activity that is incidental to the primary focus. It includes things such as marketing and marketing analysis. However, the detailed project application of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation specifies that the project must be of net benefit through cost savings or general economic benefits, through the provision of new export markets or environmental improvements, or through a reduction in land degradation. That is something which I do not think the opinion polling to which I have referred really has much connection with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The connection is very tenuous at best. Even if the opinion polling was only about the specific purchasing of timber products that are labelled in a particular way&mdash;which it was not&mdash;the connection is obviously a little bit remote from the primary purpose of the corporation. One could well ask why it did not deal with the real issues associated with certification, such as ISO 14,000, the Montreal process and the Forest Stewardship Council&mdash;all of which are very worthwhile initiatives relating to the question of timber from sustainable sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though a minority of Commonwealth funds are involved in the project&mdash;roughly about $8,000&mdash;and clearly some of the questions do have some tenuous connection with the charter of the research and development corporation, it seems clear to me that the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation funding has in effect been used to bolster political opinion polling by NAFI. Given that NAFI is represented on the board of the corporation which makes the decisions and which approves the funding, this in my view is a very dangerous commingling of public and private moneys and may constitute a possible misuse of government money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Worldwide Fund for Nature and I have written separately to the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) asking him to investigate and to ensure that this sort of thing will not happen again and that these sorts of things are clearly separated. People who support the timber industry often attack the environment movement when it gets funding to undertake research, but in this case we have a situation where funding, in my view, has been misdirected and misused by NAFI in order to assist its political purposes. I call on the minister to ensure that this situation is properly investigated and that these things do not occur again in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter on behalf of the people in Australia, especially the children, who suffer from cystic fibrosis. As you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Cystic Fibrosis Association has been endeavouring to persuade the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the government and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to include on the available health care pharmaceutical benefits list a drug that is having a dramatic and beneficial effect in respect of the treatment of this disease. It is particularly helpful to children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drug is known as pulmozyme. If you have any knowledge of cystic fibrosis, you will know that the average life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis is 30 years of age. Children with the disease spend an enormous amount of time in hospital. They develop pulmonary infections and pneumonia. This is very disruptive to their education and their lifestyles. I am not an expert, but I am told by families with children who have used the drug that the effect on their lifestyle is dramatic. The children are able to stay out of hospital and enjoy life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current cost of this drug is prohibitive to most families. In fact, regrettably it costs $1,300 per month. The fact is that the pharmaceutical board has not issued any new medication for cystic fibrosis sufferers in Australia in the last 30 years. The sufferers of cystic fibrosis have been endeavouring to have this drug considered and approved by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have been anxious to raise this issue tonight is that I understand the committee is meeting on Wednesday this week. I am hoping that the committee and the minister for health will at last make a decision that will support the inclusion of this drug on the list and help these kids who deserve help. I am quite sure that the cost of $1,300 a month would not be begrudged by Australian taxpayers. I have spoken to a lot of people about this.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9T4">Mr Walker</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Details on Commonwealth owned office, commercial and industrial properties managed by Australian Estate Management, a part of my Department, are contained in the attached spreadsheet. They include information on leases by other portfolios in these properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For your information, the floor area of a property defined as vacant consists of all parts of the Net Lettable Area not currently exclusively leased to a specific tenant. The rental per square metre is an average derived by dividing total building income by the total occupied area. Total building income includes rent received for office and storage space, some common areas, car parking and signage rights, but excludes payments received from tenants for outgoings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will note that there are no capital valuations for the Terrica Place and Kununurra offices. These buildings have only recently been completed and valuations are under way. Furthermore, in a number of single-tenanted buildings the average rent has not been provided where the tenant considered that the disclosure of that information might have an adverse effect on current or future property dealings by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reason for withholding of information is fully in accordance with the "Guidelines on the Disclosure of Commercially Sensitive Property Information" which I have recommended to all departments and agencies. The Guidelines are based on the principle that details of rents paid by Commonwealth agencies and information on capital valuations of specific Commonwealth-owned properties should be withheld as commercial-in-confidence where disclosure might have an adverse effect on current or future property dealings by the Commonwealth. They identify particular circumstances where that principle may apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Details on properties leased by my Department and portfolio agencies from non-Commonwealth owners are shown in the attached spreadsheets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details are provided in an aggregated format at building level because of the commercial-in-confidence nature of the property data. Where a building is occupied by a single Commonwealth business unit, the rental rate is withheld in accordance with the Guidelines referred to in my answer to Part 1 of the question. The particular circumstance applicable in these cases is that where disclosure of rentals paid by Commonwealth businesses would allow competitors to draw conclusions about cost structures, thereby placing the Commonwealth at a commercial disadvantage.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No, residual harvesting is not a term normally used to describe State and Territory harvesting operations. The production of pulpwood is a by product of operations intended to produce sawlogs. The amount of pulpwood that is generated varies depending on the type of harvesting undertaken and the proportion of sawlogs to pulplogs in forests to be harvested. There is no single term which describes all the harvesting methods by which chips may be derived.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Roundwood will be used for the production of woodchips when production of sawn timber of a saleable quality is not technically and economically feasible. A proportion of trees harvested will contain faults or other characteristics which render them unsuitable for use as sawn timber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situations in which a party may withdraw from a treaty which contains no provision for withdrawal are set out in Section 3 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) (Australian Treaty Series, 1974 number 2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A party may withdraw from a treaty which contains no specific withdrawal provision where it is established either that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal, or where a right of denunciation may be implied by the nature of the treaty. A party withdrawing from such a treaty is required to give at least twelve months' notice of its intention to withdraw from the treaty. This procedure covers so-called unilateral withdrawal from a treaty. The Convention also provides for withdrawal where all the treaty parties have been consulted and consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties also deals with certain exceptional cases in which a party may claim that it is not bound by the treaty. Those cases relate principally to situations where there was a defect in the party's consent to be bound, or where the party alleges the treaty is invalid. In such cases, the Convention requires the party wishing to withdraw to notify the other parties of its claim to the right of withdrawal. If no objection to the claim is raised within three months, the party may withdraw from the treaty in question by communicating an instrument indicating its intention to the other parties. If another party does object, the parties are required to seek a solution to the issue in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</PARA>

This occurred in September 1994 during the ground conversion training of Ansett pilots by Qantas. Personnel attending the course were accommodated at the Sheraton Sydney Airport hotel. Ansett developed new operating procedures related to push-back, starting and taxiing of aircraft and associated checklists. Ansett intended to hand the new procedures to the trainees for their use at the next session of training.

However, the concern was allayed when Ansett announced its decision to use former Qantas and Air New Zealand Boeing 747 captains under contract to conduct the line training of Ansett crew and to act as training captains on flights for the first few months of line operations.</PARA>

The joint statement provided that entering into an international treaty is not a reason for raising any expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been incorporated into Australian law. The High Court in the Teoh case made it quite clear that any legitimate expectation arising out of Australia becoming a Party to a treaty could only arise if there had been no executive or legislative indications to the contrary. The joint statement of 10 May constitutes such an executive indication and since that date no treaty to which Australia is a party should give rise to a legitimate expectation for the administrative law purposes identified in Teoh's case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. As the issues raised in the later parts of the question impact on the earlier answers, he has addressed the question in the following sequential order:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In accordance with its international obligations as a party to the Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs 1961, Australia is required to exercise certain controls over trade, cultivation and use of cannabis (or hemp). Whilst the Convention specifically exempts the growing of cannabis for industrial purposes from its control, parties to the Convention are obliged to adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the misuse of, and illicit traffic in, the leaves of the cannabis plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Departments of Health are responsible for authorising persons to possess and cultivate cannabis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, through the Department of Human Services and Health is responsible for the issue of licences and permits to import and permits to export cannabis including seeds and resin. These controls apply irrespective of the level of active constituents and licences and permits cannot be issued without evidence of compliance with the relevant State or Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As outlined above, matters relating to the production of hemp are a State responsibility. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth, as a general rule, is supportive of value adding activities and is funding, through the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), research into the prospects for a viable hemp industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RIRDC is currently finalising details for a feasibility study aimed at providing accurate technical information and an assessment of the agronomic, industrial and marketing potential of an Australian Indian hemp industry for fibre, oil and biomass production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study will concentrate on the Australian context and will involve extensive consultation with other interested groups. In particular, it will explore how hemp will compete with, or complement, other traditional fibre sources. It will also be looking closely, in a commercial sense, at whether returns are likely to cover the substantial costs of establishing facilities to extract and process the new fibre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RIRDC study will complement research being carried out in the States. Until recently, licences to cultivate hemp had only been issued in Tasmania where two crops totalling around 2 hectares per year have been grown on a trial basis. The University of Tasmania is responsible for the majority of production with the Tasmanian Hemp Company also involved. These licences include a stipulation that, inter alia, plantings would be used to test viability for production for fibre for both paper and clothing manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Australian Minister for Health has now also authorised Primary Industries South Australia and the South Australian Research and Development Institute to grow hemp under strict security on 3 small sites to evaluate several imported cultivars which are deemed to have the best potential under South Australian conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Implementation of China's one-child policy at the local level can result in coercive practices which the Australian Government does not in any way condone. Such coercive practices are however, on the whole, rogue applications of the one-child policy by over-zealous officials at the local level. Through provincial regulations, fines are commonly applied as a sanction to families with more than one-child. But application of the fines, and the one-child policy, is becoming more difficult as social controls in China ease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's new Maternal and Infant Health Law which came into effect on 1 June 1995 includes provisions that couples with certain medical conditions may not marry unless they undertake long-term contraceptive measures or agree to sterilisation. In the case of certain prenatal diagnoses the physician may advise the parents to terminate the pregnancy. However, the law stipulates that any termination requires the signed consent of the person concerned. The need for consent is welcome although the way the law is implemented is clearly critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government has made clear on many occasions that coercion has no place in family planning programs. We support the provision of safe, voluntary family planning services in the interests of women's health and family well being. Australia will uphold these principles at the forthcoming World Conference on Women as we have done at previous international forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. The People's Republic of China is a Member State of the United Nations and has equal rights with other Member States to host a United Nations Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government supports the right of all women, including Taiwanese and Tibetan women, to attend the Fourth World Conference on Women. The Australian Government has made representations to the United Nations to ensure that the process of accreditation of NGOs, for which the United Nations has responsibility, is a transparent one and that the criteria are applied consistently to all organisations seeking accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the 39th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (March/April 1995), Australia co-sponsored a resolution calling on the United Nations to ensure that its NGO accreditation process was transparent. Later, the General Assembly, with the support of Australia, passed a similar resolution. The United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is formally responsible for accrediting NGOs to the Conference. The ECOSOC is currently meeting to consider NGO accreditation. Australia will continue to pursue at ECOSOC its support for the right of all women to attend the conference.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr Baldwin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian and Greek Governments have been discussing a social security agreement periodically over the past five years, during which both sides have been working hard to assess whether an agreement is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been four rounds of talks during this period. At these meetings Australia has expressed its concern about the lack of reciprocity of benefits and the limited social insurance coverage of Greek-Australians under the Greek social security system. Reciprocity is one of the fundamental principles on which our agreements are negotiated. The type of agreement that we are able to offer Greece depends on the extent to which these principles are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a meeting in Athens in May 1994, the Australian delegation presented the Greek delegation with the text of a draft agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The negotiations have been protracted for a number of reasons. Greece conducted a survey of former Greek-Australians in Greece and Australia in an attempt to determine the extent of coverage by the Greek scheme. The results of the survey and its `interpretation' took two years to complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations were delayed when talks scheduled for July 1994 in Canberra, following the meeting in May, were postponed by Greece at short notice because the leader of the Greek delegation became ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia agreed to resume talks in October 1994, again in Canberra. However, these talks were again postponed by Greece at short notice because the leader of the delegation was required for parliamentary duties in Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When negotiations finally resumed in April 1995, the Greek side informed the Australian delegation for the first time that it had difficulty with a fundamental provision in the Australian draft agreement; that is, the draft agreement presented almost one full year before in May 1994. The provision in question concerns the rate of pensions Australia would pay to people who already live in Greece. It does not affect people who live in Australia or pensioners who have already returned to Greece with their Australian pensions, or who will return to Greece in future with their pensions. The Greek side was informed that the provision was fundamental and it agreed to re-examine its position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I hope the matter will be resolved when Greece appreciates that the proposal that we have offered recognises the imbalances between our social security systems and is an attempt to address them in a fair and reasonable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The major point of difference is, as I have mentioned earlier, the issue of the rate of pensions payable in Greece under the Agreement. Each Australian agreement is different because it must recognise the particular features of the different social security arrangements in each country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian proposal took into account the level of Greek payments into Australia, both before and after a proposed agreement, the population flow between the two countries and the nature of the two countries' social security systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agreements with overseas countries do differ and there are substantial differences between the Agreements with, for example, the United Kingdom (Australia does not grant its pensions in the UK); New Zealand (where each government has agreed to mutual reimbursement for pensions covered by the Agreement); the Netherlands (where currently only age pension is included); etc, which reflect the differences in the social security systems and the capacity of the respective countries to reciprocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed formula on the rate of pensions payable in Greece is considered appropriate for an agreement with Greece because it protects Australia to some extent from the imbalance of payments under the two existing systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia already pays over 8,000 pensions into Greece at a cost of close to $60m a year. With an agreement along the lines preferred by the Greek side, this would increase by some $50m a year. At present, Greece pays very little pension into Australia (some 100 pensions). I do not believe that this figure will increase by much under an agreement because of the basic nature of the Greek pension system. This is borne out by information we have received from one of Greece's other agreement partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is nevertheless prepared to have an agreement with Greece based on the formula proposed by Australia which itself adds some $18m to the cost of pensions paid into Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the proposed model is different to some other existing agreements, that difference will not affect people who go back to Greece taking Australian pensions that have been granted in Australia under the normal provisions in the Social Security Act 1991. It could only affect those people who are already living in Greece when they claim a pension under the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must emphasise that, with or without an agreement, Australia will continue to meet its obligations to Greek-Australian residents and those who have returned to Greece with their Australian pensions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Occasional Paper entitled "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in the Australian Labour Market 1986 and 1991" was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in early June 1995. The figures in the report showed that, at the date of the 1991 census, indigenous Australians were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as other Australians and had a lower self-employment rate. The data also indicated that indigenous Australians were more likely to be working in unskilled occupations and that 44 per cent of those employed worked in Public Administration and Community Services compared with 23 per cent of other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report noted the fact that between 1971 and 1986 there was a four-fold increase in the proportion of indigenous people who were unemployed but also pointed to a reversal of this trend between 1986 and 1991. Between 1986 and 1991 the proportion of the indigenous population of working age recorded as employed rose from 31.3 per cent to 37.1 per cent while the proportion unemployed fell from 17.1 per cent to 16.5 per cent. The paper also noted the effects of the Community Development Employment Program (CDEP) and labour market programs in improving the employment to population ratio for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people between 1986 and 1991. (ABS Census data show an increase of over 16 per cent in the indigenous working age population over this period.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government is concerned about the disadvantaged labour market status of indigenous Australians. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have received benefits from policies aimed at increasing control over their own affairs and from substantial increases in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as priority access to regular labour market programs under which the majority of program assistance is provided indigenous people receive special assistance under TAP&mdash;the Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Program. Extra mainstream program places have been provided under the Government's Working Nation strategy. The TAP budget for 1995-96 has also been increased significantly (from $44.8 million in 1994-95 to $50.4 million in 1995-96). In 1995-96 TAP will be funded from the main Labour Market Program appropriation, thereby increasing the funding flexibility and program options available to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service levels in excess of Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) register share are being achieved for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients under Working Nation. To the end of May 1995 4.5 per cent of job placements were for the client group, compared to their 3.7 per cent share of the CES register. Around 6 per cent of clients under case management and 5.4 per cent of case managed outcomes were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients, compared to a 4.2 per cent share of the register of long term unemployed clients. Some 5.4 per cent of all labour market program places were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status is one of the characteristics used during the CES registration process to identify clients at risk of long term unemployment. Such clients are then assessed in more detail to determine the severity of their disadvantage and the need for case management and other forms of assistance. To assist indigenous people in remote areas with limited employment prospects, additional funding has been made available for CDEP places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indigenous Australians are major beneficiaries of the Remote Area Field Service (RAFS) which provides employment and training services to remote area employers and unemployed jobseekers with limited or no access to a CES office. RAFS teams operate from 30 CES offices, mainly in northern and central Australia, providing employment and training assistance to an estimated 16,500 unemployed jobseekers, including 11,500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander jobseekers. The RAFS teams are cooperating with other Commonwealth agencies servicing remote communities to streamline servicing arrangements and to maximise the employment opportunities available to remote jobseekers through infrastructure projects. Through the use of Mobile Office Information Technology and satellite telephone and communications equipment, the RAFS teams are able to match the client service standards provided by CES offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mid 1994 the results of a review of the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy were released. Following extensive consultations during 1995 the Government will be considering revisions to the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation also established 62 Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) to increase local community input to the delivery of programs and services to employers and jobseekers by the CES. Membership of ACCs is drawn principally from industry to enable ACCs to fulfil their role of generating employment initiatives, increasing the responsiveness of the CES to regional labour markets and linking Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) programs with regional development. A typical ACC comprises employers, unions, community and regional organisations, government representatives and major education and training providers and is chaired by an industry representative.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government has always maintained a policy of recognising eligible service by members of the Australian Defence Force and other entitled persons or groups by the awarding of an appropriate medal. Prior to 1975, this recognition was through the medium of the Imperial system of honours and awards. Since 1975, indigenous Australian awards have been available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Since the end of World War II subsequent campaign awards under the Imperial System for service in South East Asia, including Vietnam, have been common to all three services, that is, service afloat, service ashore and service in the air. Entitlements are, therefore, determined by the environment in which members operate rather than the service to which they belong. This means that a RAAF pilot would become eligible under the same conditions as those for a Naval pilot and RAN clearance divers would be under the same qualifying conditions as other ground forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As indicated in the response to question 2, the conditions applying to the Vietnam Medal are common to all three services; that is, entitlement to the medal is determined by the environment in which members operated rather than the service to which they belonged. Those conditions were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) service of twenty-eight days, continuous or aggregated, in ships or craft employed in operations on inland waters or off the coast of Vietnam:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) one operational sortie over Vietnam or Vietnamese waters by aircrew on the posted strength of a unit allocated for direct support of operations in Vietnam; or</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards (CIDA) recently conducted an extremely comprehensive review of awards for defence and defence related activities. The Government believes the Committee achieved a remarkable result considering the range of awards reviewed and particularly as recognition for some periods of service has been achieved after many years. For example, the changes in eligibility for the award of the World War II medals, the 1939-45 Star and the Africa Star have resulted in many Australians being granted these medals in time for Anzac Day 1995&mdash;some fifty years after the event. However, the Government appreciates that, even with such an extensive review, anomalies will and do occur. To ensure adequate review of such matters, the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Honours and Awards chaired by the Department of Administrative Services has, and will continue to review anomalous situations brought to its attention.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Widowed person allowance provided short term assistance, usually up to 14 weeks, for both women and men without children in the period immediately following the death of their partner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As at 23 June 1995, the number of widow allowance recipients was 8,912.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Women in receipt of widow allowance would otherwise qualify for JSA/NSA or another social security payment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) (a) The Department of Social Security does not have data available to provide a reliable estimate of the number of additional recipients or the cost of lowering the age qualifications as indicated.

No equivalent estimate is available for lowering the qualifying age to 45 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)  If women who become eligible for widow allowance because of a lower qualifying age transfer from JSA/NSA or other social security payments there would be no additional cost. However, providing earlier access to a non-activity tested payment could be expected to reduce the incentive for these women to participate in the workforce. This may ultimately result in increased expenditure on social security income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Government is not considering lowering the age qualification for widow allowance to 45 or 40 years. The Government considers that women who lose the support of a partner at a younger age will generally be more able to participate in the workforce and would benefit most from other measures designed to assist and encourage their workforce participation. For this reason, JSA/NSA remains a better option than widow allowance for these women because it provides access to a full range of labour market programs including the Job Compact. The Government is committed to encouraging and supporting women to participate in the paid workforce to best ensure their financial security.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The assessment of drought exceptional circumstances in NSW was based on a submission from the State Government which did not indicate that conditions in Division A were worse than in the other Divisions of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board (RLPB). Indeed the NSW State drought declarations for all divisions of Nyngan RLPB were lifted at the end of March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Division A of Nyngan RLPB was not included in the area declared to be in drought exceptional circumstances on 29 May 1995, because it did not meet the threshold meteorological criterion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Section 909 (1) of the Social Security Act provides that Parenting Allowance cannot be paid to a person receiving income from a Commonwealth funded employment program. The Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Scheme is defined as such a program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision is based on the multiple entitlement exclusion principle which provides that it is not possible to receive more than one income support payment at any given time. It also provides consistent treatment with the exclusion from the CDEP that operates with Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance, Youth Training Allowance, Partner Allowance, Widow Allowance and Mature Age Allowance. The exclusion from Parenting Allowance only operates when a person is receiving income from the CDEP.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Commonwealth Government demonstrates its commitment to ensuring that students with disabilities are not disadvantaged by lack of wheelchair access to educational institutions through two programs&mdash;the Special Education Component of the Access Element of the National Equity Program for Schools (NEPS) and the Capital Grants program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the Special Education Component are to improve the educational participation and outcomes of young people with disabilities through the provision of targeted assistance. The Component supports the provision of capital facilities, such as wheelchair access, which are integral to providing educational and therapeutic services for students with disabilities. The primary responsibility for special education rests with State and Territory governments, the Commonwealth's contribution to special education is a supplementary one only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Administrative Guidelines for the Commonwealth's Capital Grants Program for schools, the Government states that it expects all new buildings (and where possible, all buildings being refurbished) to be designed to facilitate access by people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government has implemented programs to help State and independent schools upgrade their classrooms and libraries to ensure wheelchair access via ramps or lifts. Under the NEPS Special Education Component it is usual for priority to be given to physical access ramps. Significant numbers of government and non-government schools are being made more wheelchair accessible using Commonwealth funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Responsibility for the administration of NEPS funds and the implementation of programs rests with the schooling authorities. Representative committees determine spending priorities based on student needs at specific schools and within the policies of the schooling authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the Capital Grants Program block grants are made to both the Department of School Education and the Catholic Education Commission in New South Wales. Each Block Grant Authority sets priorities for capital projects and forwards recommendations to the Commonwealth for Ministerial approval.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All new NSW State schools and schools undergoing major upgrading and refurbishment are designed to provide access for staff, students and community members with disabilities.
