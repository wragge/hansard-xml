<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A best kept secret&mdash;report on the role and effectiveness of group training</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FG4">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which has just been tabled deals with the role and effectiveness of group training companies. The success of these companies is possibly Australia's best kept secret. Group training is a uniquely Australian system of providing people with the skills necessary to become productive members of the work force. They occupy a particular niche in entry level employment and training in small and medium sized businesses in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group training companies employ apprentices and trainees and place these employees with host employers on a rotation basis for the duration of their indenture or traineeship. Group training companies interview, assess and select employees and match them with host employers. The group training company remains the employer and responsible for the payment of wages, payroll tax and on-costs which are then charged to host employers through charge out rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The natural market for group training is small and medium sized enterprises. By reducing the time and costs associated with employing apprentices and trainees, group training offers considerable benefits to these enterprises. Group training companies are particularly effective in assisting with the school to work transition for young people. By monitoring the performance of the apprentice and trainee, providing pastoral care, intervening in disputes or rotating the apprentice or trainee when necessary, the companies are able to assist young people at risk and maximise completion of training contracts. In addition, group training can create positions for people who, for a variety of reasons, find it difficult to secure apprenticeships and traineeships with individual employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenges of increasingly competitive and domestic markets are transforming Australia's attitude to vocational education and training. Australia has embarked on a process of change which recognises that employees must be multiskilled and adaptable and aware that learning is a lifelong process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms recognise the need to strengthen the links between schools, training providers and the workplace. What disturbs the committee, however, is that employers, teachers and the general community have a lack of understanding of the reform process. The clear statements of objectives in the reform agenda are confused by a bewildering array of acronyms and a maze of agencies, boards and committees. There has been insufficient commitment by some sectors and enterprises to the more complex components of the reform proposals. The committee believes that the overall objectives of the training reforms will not be achieved without fundamental changes in approach and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group training companies form a network which has a better understanding than others of the reform agenda. This understanding and commitment must be fully utilised if the reform process is to meet the targets set by government. Group training companies are the largest employer of apprentices and trainees. This makes them one of the most powerful forces for the implementation of change. The committee believes that the group training companies have responded to the challenge of a radically changed approach to vocational education and training and possess the potential to be an even more influential force in driving the reform agenda. Group training companies are ideally placed to be major players in the training reform and employment initiatives. They have community based structures operating in every region in Australia and work closely with thousands of small and medium sized businesses across a wide range of industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of this, group training companies are ideally placed to persuade individual enterprises to undertake  structured training, identify training needs, and feed this information into the development of competencies and course modules which are relevant to the individual enterprise. They are well placed to bring the job seeker and the employer together for the benefit of both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My committee found that group training companies can play a significant role in getting the unemployed back to work. Although the data is limited, our discussions with individual group training companies indicate that group training and labor market programs have better outcomes than other programs. The committee has recommended that for successful group training companies the normal DEET tender processes for labor market programs should be waived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the group training companies visited by the committee were critical of the quality of some labour market programs. It a dispiriting use of human and financial resources to provide training for people who cannot find employment so as to utilise the skills which they have gained. Also, it is exasperating if these skills gained do not meet the industry requirements in a particular region. Group training companies, through their field placement officers and through contact with their participating host employers, are well placed to ascertain local needs and to give advice to funding providers. Government departments must be in close consultation with the employer organisations and employers and take advice from those who know the needs of a particular area. It is essential that the training provisions be structured to meet these needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was told that there was a trend to shorten the trade skill content of courses and to concentrate on the life skills content. While this may be appropriate in some instances, it can in many cases lead to reduced skill level outcomes to the disadvantage of trainees as well as prospective future employers. The committee believes that group training companies need to be more closely involved in both the development of labour market programs and initiatives and the practical formulation and content of labour market training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that group training companies need to be more closely involved in both the development of labour market programs and initiatives and the practical formulation and content of labour market training courses. The committee agrees with the views of the Employment and Skills Formation Council that some of the funding now directed to labour market programs should be directed instead to group training companies to enable them to employ disadvantaged job seekers in mainstream apprenticeships and traineeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also examined the financial management of group training companies. While we found that many group training companies had sophisticated financial management systems, in many instances planning, budgeting and financial management skills of companies were relatively rudimentary. The committee agrees with earlier reviews which concluded that the planning, management, financial and marketing skills of group training companies be improved. The committee believes that it is largely up to individual companies to determine the financial system which best suits the company. However, the company should be encouraged to adopt a system based on best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted that many group schemes have accumulated significant reserves. State governments consider that large reserves indicate self-sufficiency and ability to operate without continued government support. However, the committee considers that significant reserves should not be confused with excessive reserves, as some companies also have significant liabilities. Inconsistent accounting practices made it difficult for us to measure and analyse the level of reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that it is appropriate for governments to discuss with group training companies priority areas of vocational education and training where these reserves could be directed. However, the committee's view is that governments have no right to direct companies to allocate reserves to particular aspects of vocational education and training, nor should the level of reserves affect the level of government funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite their national spread and effectiveness, group training companies are poorly represented on policy and advisory bodies. This is to deny governments the wealth of experience and local knowledge of the 1,000 business and community leaders from all areas of Australia who constitute the boards of group training companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in my statement I noted the lack of commitment to the training reforms because of the remoteness of the decision making process. Group training companies are ideally placed to bring a sense of local ownership to the process of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a trend for governments to reduce the number of apprentices and trainees which they employ. It is the committee's view that governments have the same obligations as other employers to contribute to the expansion of Australia's skills base. Group training companies are ideally placed to assist government in achieving the twin objectives of smaller government and a well trained work force. The link with government enterprises will also increase the training opportunities for apprentices and trainees employed by group training companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group training companies have shown their potential to adapt to changing circumstances, notably through the diversification of activities in response to changed funding arrangements. It is essential that governments and employers recognise the ability of group training companies to deliver quality employment and training outcomes and utilise their vitality and unbounded enthusiasm for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I thank the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), all committee members and the committee secretariat for their work, inspiration and cooperation in the presentation and delivery of this report. I have great pleasure in commending the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity this morning to speak to the committee's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A best kept secret&mdash;report on the role and effectiveness of group training</EMPHASIS>. Late in the 1980s, I first became aware of the group training concept as an employer in the building construction industry. On some occasions, I utilised carpenter and plumber apprentices for a short period of time in my business in order to fill a shortfall and in order to give the young people some varied experience which was different from the experience they normally had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 I ran into group training again in a more comprehensive manner in the House of Representatives, when it came to my attention that the Hon. John Dawkins, the then federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, had made a decision to slash the recurrent spending for group training companies. At the behest of people from the duly to be formed organisation Group Training Australia and other organisations around Australia, I went to John Dawkins with their request and said, `I believe that this is a unique mechanism for training apprentices and trainees in Australia. We should continue the funding'&mdash;because the funding was very small&mdash;`and not destroy a unique Australian institution which is dedicated to giving a high level of skills to young Australians to use in the work force.' I was unsuccessful but, with the efflux of time and with increasing pressure on the minister, eventually the funding cuts were put in abeyance. So, funding for the administrative side of running group training companies has been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years, with the help of Group Training Australia and with some real initiatives by some very strong leaders in individual group training companies, this unique Australian mechanism of training young people has really come to the fore. We have seen some very innovative and modern approaches to training people and giving them the kinds of skills that are relevant in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great range of bureaucratic mechanisms and operations in the training market today. In fact, there is a bewildering array of organisations and acronyms. The cover of our report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A best kept secret</EMPHASIS>, shows group training in the centre of a maze&mdash;a maze which represents Australia's training mechanisms&mdash;and I think that is highly appropriate. I thank the artist who drew that and, in particular, I thank the committee secretary, Mr John Cummins, for that concept. They have done well to recognise the place of group training in Australia&mdash;in the centre of something that is very confusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strength of group training companies comes largely from their diversity, their independence and the fact that they are not dominated by the bureaucracy. That is one of the things that make them work. They have the opportunity to decide for themselves whom they hire. So, they hire young women or men based on the qualities they are looking for, and they discover who has those qualities from aptitude tests, intelligence tests and discussions with the young people about their attitudes to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies then hire the best people and give them up-front training as an induction into the real world of work. They arrange for their training at TAFE or, increasingly, at a private institution and then find them jobs with host employers in their particular trade category. With a bit of luck, over time the young people are moved from employer to employer so that they get a range of experience in different kinds of operations in their work category. That is important, because it enables them to get a range of experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers grow on-the-job. Those who leave the group training system as apprentices who have graduated and done their time&mdash;it makes no difference whether they are hairdressers, carpenters, plumbers, metalworkers or mechanics&mdash;are highly valued by industry, to the point that any young person who finishes an apprenticeship with a group training company is almost guaranteed a job at a good rate of pay. That speaks miles for the quality of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that help make group training companies successful is the fact that they frequently conduct prevocational training. When they bring young people in from the outside, they tell them what industry is all about. The craft subsidy helped give the group training companies the money up front in order to be able to conduct the prevocational training. One of our recommendations is to restore those subsidies to give the group training companies the additional funding they need to make sure their young people are well aware of the health and safety requirements at work, that they are aware that they need to show up on time, that it is a good idea to have a shower, use a bit of deodorant and brush your teeth before you show up at work because their colleagues at work will appreciate that. These sound like simple and stupid things, but frequently we find today in the real world of work that these bits of information may be missing from many young people, and that is a shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group training system itself has proved particularly innovative over the last few years. We saw this as we travelled around Australia to visit both schemes that were dedicated to one trade, represented by a major city or state area, and schemes that represented a region out in country Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia or, indeed, Tasmania. Some of them have done some very innovative things and have implemented some new practices or some new mechanism for imparting skills to young people that industry really wants. All of this bypasses this huge bureaucratic network that the government has set up, which has largely done nothing to support increased training but has in fact thwarted efforts to increase the number of apprenticeships and the number of traineeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me this morning if, after the budget release last night, I did not make mention of the fact that the budget forecast a 30 per cent cut in Commonwealth funding for skills training at a time when we still have in excess of eight per cent unemployment. When unemployment for young people is still in excess of 20 per cent, we are now going to cut the allocation for skills training by the Commonwealth to young people. I think that is a bad mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of recommendations we have made in this report that I think are particularly important. Some of them will require some money. The first is that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments agree to maintain funding for the core activities of group training companies. I will not go on and read the other recommendations because time is short, but the implementation of the recommendations will require some money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone else in the training system will now have to suffer because the committee is determined that group training companies shall survive. The movement should survive. In fact, we would like to see it grow, increase and become the basis, really, of imparting apprenticeship and traineeship skills to young people and of managing the transition from school to work for young people throughout the width and breadth of Australia. We have made 37 recommendations. This is a serious, comprehensive report&mdash;the first report ever into this unique Australian institution of group training companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish, on behalf of the committee, to once again thank our very excellent committee secretary, Mr John Cummins, for the fantastic work he does in relation to this field of employment, education and training. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to speak on group training as one of the very few tradesmen in this place, which is a bit of a shame. I think there are under 12 people in the whole of the federal parliament who have done their apprenticeship. That is a shame because I think apprenticeships are something this nation needs. That is one of the reasons for this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish the group training scheme had been around when I did my apprenticeship at Coxhead Industrial Engineering Co. in Lower Dandenong Road, Mentone. It put the old whip on our back. Never has an apprentice worked so hard or made so much money. Back in those days we worked in the one shop. We did our apprenticeship&mdash;I am a turner and fitter by trade. We only knew the machinery and the tools that were in that shop. This idea of group training, spreading the apprentices around, is a great idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the driving forces behind the group training scheme is in the gallery today, Mr Tom Quinn. I am glad to see him. He is someone who pushed very hard for the scheme in Queensland. I remember going to have a look at apprentices working on the houses up there. They upgraded a derelict house to an excellent condition. It was sold and that funded the group training, and it went from there. To me it is a great scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I wanted to do was to make certain I got one in Frankston. I am pleased to say that I have an agency there and we have a person working there full time. A lot of arm twisting was involved. Not mentioning names, the Victorian government cannot get away with it. It did not want another group training scheme. It would not put in its little bit to have another secretariat. I convinced the Dandenong-Westernport group training scheme to have an agent in Frankston. It has a person there. He started before Christmas. We now have 70 new apprentices on the peninsula. This is a huge increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dandenong-Westernport training group has 200 apprentices under its control now. I was speaking to the manager of the training group, Barry Smith, just recently and he told me this. He was very pleased. I said, `Why have you got only 200?' So he is now going for the 300 mark, and I hope he can achieve it by the end of the year. I would like to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think apprentices are vital to this nation. It is low pay. My daughter is an apprentice. She works in the horticultural industry. I think she gets $150 a week as a first-year apprentice. However, the skills that she will learn will set her up for the rest of her life. I am very pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group training is a great scheme. It is uniquely Australian. It is something we can export overseas. Let us show the world how it is done. I really believe that we should put a lot more money into this particular scheme. It is something good, something worth while and it is great for our kids. I am very pleased to be associated with this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the few minutes remaining in this presentation I, too, would like to congratulate the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for their leadership of the committee and Mr John Cummins, the secretary, for excellent work. Unlike some honourable members, I did not do an apprenticeship, but I was an inaugural member of a group apprenticeship scheme and have served on a group apprenticeship scheme ever since the early inauguration in the early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the preamble of the report, we said that the system was uniquely Australian and was one of Australia's best kept secrets, as indeed it is. Group training companies, in providing structured training, are contributing massively to Australia's skill base. They are the largest employer of apprentices in Australia, being responsible for nearly 12 per cent of all apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Queensland nearly a quarter of all apprentices are trained through group training schemes. One can imagine the huge hole that that would leave in structured training in Australia if group apprenticeship schemes were to wind down or to fall out of the system. I share with the member for La Trobe a concern that the cutbacks announced in yesterday's budget do not impact on group apprenticeship schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three very interesting aspects of this report. It recognises that group training companies are very close to small and medium business, and further on the report recommends to government that this be a mechanism by which small business training takes place. It recognises that group companies have been responsible for responding to the needs of industry in delivering training in innovative and in some cases quite spectacular ways. I have no more time left but I would like to acknowledge the presence of the chairman of Group Training Australia in the gallery and commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite timely that, after the announcement of the government's 1995 budget last night, we are debating these cognate bills&mdash;Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995, Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1995 and Dairy Produce Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;and, in so doing, we are talking about one of the more competitive and dynamic rural industries that we have got in Australia; albeit not the largest, but certainly the most efficient. Listening to the speakers who participated in this debate yesterday, and those who will speak today, I am sure that nobody will argue that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the world stage in this industry, we are probably only just behind the New Zealanders as far as efficiency is concerned. We all know that there are a couple of underlying reasons why that situation exists currently. Certainly, we would hope they might be addressed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These bills put in place the mechanisms which will replace the all milk levy which was introduced originally as the Kerin plan, and then subsequently as the Crean plan. The changes have had to be made so that this mechanism will now be GATT legal. The government found that the previous support mechanisms were GATT illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That still raises a number of concerns. It should raise concerns with all Australians in relation to Australia's participation in what was the Uruguay Round of the GATT which, with the passing of the world trade organisation bill late last year, is moving Australia into a supposedly open and free market across the world in this industry. That certainly remains to be seen. In recent times we have not seen much indication of good faith from some of the other trading nations in dairy products around the world; namely, in the United States of America with the announcement of the enhancement program for its dairy products which are coming into one of our major markets in South-East Asia. It is something that the government and the bureaucracy really need to be quite vigilant about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This legislation replaces the old dairy legislation that was considered GATT illegal. It continues the phase-out of assistance at the same rate, ending in the year 2000. Under these cognate bills the support mechanisms will be GATT legal. The legislation that the dairy industry was operating under, which phases its assistance down to the equivalent of a five per cent tariff by the year 2000, was considered GATT illegal because it was seen as a subsidy to exports. The industry, the government and the coalition agreed that this legislation should be removed and replaced by legislation which would continue the same phase-out but on a GATT-legal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is worth highlighting at this point that the opposition is not opposing but supporting this legislation, including the amendment that the government will move. I might cover that a little later in my address. I certainly would have thought that, after the government had to move amending legislation to the previous system last year to cover those import provisions, the government would have covered that element when it drafted this bill instead of drafting the bill and then having to bring in a late amendment with the bill. Evidently, it did not learn its lesson then or it was not covered properly in the drafting of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old legislation worked on a levy paid by dairy farmers on all milk. This money was pooled and then used to assist export returns. It was on a sliding scale downwards to the year 2000. This assistance to exports kept companies exporting and prevented them from dumping their product on the home market, forcing the price down. Honourable members will recall that in the mid-1980s and early-1980s there was always great competition for market milk supplies into particularly the Sydney market between the New South Wales dairy farmers and the Victorian dairy farmers. I suppose we will never stop hearing from the Victorian representatives about how fantastic and how large the industry is in Victoria in comparison with New South Wales, Queensland and the rest of Australia. We all acknowledge that fact but, looking on an industry-wide basis, I think we all need to acknowledge how vital and how important the dairy industry is to our export income. Many of our rural industries, having led with their development of technology and improved breeding programs, really are at the forefront of world competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation sets a levy on market milk which will be no more than the current all milk levy but which will be based on protein and fat rather than just on fat. This levy will be paid by farmers supplying milk. This is GATT legal because market milk is not exported. Instead of farmers paying a levy on the milk being used for manufacture, as they now do, there will be a levy on domestic manufactured products paid by manufacturers. These funds will be redistributed to farmers based on the amount of manufacturing milk they have supplied. This means the assistance will now be clearly identifiable as a domestic market support scheme rather than an export subsidy scheme. This makes it GATT legal and the phase-out continues in the same way as the old or the previous system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new scheme will terminate on 30 June in the year 2000 with any surplus of funds at that time going to the Australian Dairy Corporation. It will not cause the price of dairy products to rise, because it is simply taking the levy that was previously paid on all milk and placing it on market milk product. It is interesting to note&mdash;and it should be recorded&mdash;that the proposed new scheme has the support of the dairy industry, the Australian Dairy Corporation, the state bodies and the opposition in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the reason this legislation has had to come before the House. Honourable members will recall that at the end of last year the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 was passed through this place terminating the current scheme on 30 June 1995. It was proclaimed on 30 December 1994 to enable signing onto the World Trade Organisation agreement on 1 January 1995. At that point we became committed to the World Trade Organisation, which has taken the place of the GATT. The new support arrangements will meet Australia's commitment under the Uruguay Round to reduce its domestic aggregate measure of support by 20 per cent from 1995-96 to the year 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that it is all very well that we are saying we are heading down this path and we are going to be competing on a level playing field where a lot of our rural products are concerned, but our commitment under the Uruguay Round of GATT was to reducing our domestic aggregate measure of support by 20 per cent. If that were drawn across all the participants that are signatories to the GATT agreement, that would be fine. We may say that we are all heading down the same path toward the year 2000 or into the future with reduction in support mechanisms, but it will depend on what base we start from in trying to achieve that 20 per cent reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some countries, in particular in Europe and the United Kingdom, the support mechanisms are absolutely frightening. Australia is leading the pack as far as reducing our support mechanisms and reducing our protection are concerned by reversing tariffication. We may be saying we are all going to reduce our domestic aggregate measure by 20 per cent, but it depends on where we start from as to how competitive we will still be in the year 2000. I have said on a number of occasions in this place that that is all well and good but the support mechanisms and the tariffication mechanisms in some of these countries are so high that those countries will still be way out in front in the future as far as their support mechanisms are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For us to compete in the future on what is loosely termed a level playing field, we will still have to be far more competitive than some nations we will be competing against in the marketplace.

Come the middle of this year, when we all get serious about where we signed off on GATT and when the World Trade Organisation gets into stride, it will be interesting to see how fair dinkum these countries are when they fly in the face of the spirit of that agreement with the support they provide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I will make a brief comment on the government's amendment to the bill. As I said earlier, I suppose it is good that we are introducing the amendment now instead of in two months time when we find the anomaly arises. But it was something that was addressed with the previous mechanism. There was an amending bill moved last year to pick up those import offset provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration of import offsets will be improved by moving to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis of levies and support payments. Import offset provisions are designed to protect the amount of dairy market support flowing to manufacturing milk producers. Without these provisions, anyone could obtain a financial gain by exporting dairy produce that has been imported or displaced from the domestic market by imports and then claiming an export rebate without paying any manufacturing levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, an import offset levy payable by direct importers and an acquisition offset levy payable by a manufacturer who acquires product from an importer who has not paid import offset levy will be imposed on an annual assessment basis. The levies are not a surrogate import levy as they are applied only against the export rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That anomaly surfaced under the previous arrangements. I know, because one manufacturer in my area draws a lot of raw product out of the area but this still was not enough to satisfy export requirements as far as manufacturing products were concerned. It is all locally labelled stuff and a lot of it is being exported to New Zealand. The manufacturers were actually buying raw product&mdash;buying milk in from New Zealand to process. That gap had to be plugged, and I believe this is the intent of the amendment the government has moved to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we are supporting these bills. They are necessary so that we comply with some international arrangements that we have made. I commend the industry for its attitude and its foresight in developing the industry so that dairy produce is one of Australia's major export earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by highlighting the importance of this industry. The industry is a bigger export earner than the car manufacturing industry. We can talk about secondary manufacturing industries, but we still must focus on and nurture the primary industries in this country. In the future they will be the industries that will continue, hopefully, with good government, to reduce the current account deficit and increase exports. I hope that the government and the bureaucrats who have been involved in GATT are very diligent in signing off on that agreement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It has been part of a bipartisan approach adopted from the very start of this whole process. The harmony that exists in this debate is very much a tribute to the dairy industry itself. In recent years the dairy industry has organised itself into a very effective and united lobbying force on government and oppositions alike. The industry has adopted a degree of professionalism and thoroughness that I think some other industries could very well emulate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for the legislation has been well detailed by previous speakers, not least by my colleague the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). In essence, the legislation before the House is necessary to terminate market support payments if Australia is to comply with the final commitments under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. In other words, if we are to enact the provisions of the GATT then we need to alter the arrangements that presently exist under the so-called Crean plan for the dairy industry. It is important to stress that the legislation will provide the same level of support for the industry as is presently in place but at the same time be consistent with GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current market support scheme acts to raise domestic returns for the industry and is therefore, under the GATT, regarded as an export subsidy. The re-instrumentation process, consequently, is designed to ensure that the level of domestic support provided to the dairy industry, which has been estimated to be approximately $135 million, continues but is framed so as not to be linked to exports. The Australian Dairy Corporation advises that when the new scheme is implemented, from 1 July this year, farmers will find several changes to their monthly milk cheque. Instead of paying the all milk levy on total production, farmers will, from then on, pay a levy only on their market milk, approximately 1.9c per litre. Farmers will also receive a direct payment based on the level of manufacturing milk produced of approximately 2c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the gross farm gate price for manufacturing milk in 1995-96 will fall by up to 4c per litre from the previous year's levels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get onto Gippsland can I speak generally about the Victorian industry, which you know better than anybody else is the dominant force in the Australian dairy industry. We produce over 60 per cent of the milk, 75 per cent of the manufactured dairy products and over 85 per cent of the exported dairy products. The Victorian dairy industry is not only vital to the nation but also earns over $800 million for the state in annual exports&mdash;the state's largest agricultural income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, dairy products represent the largest single component of the Victorian food industry. There are 8 1/2 thousand dairy farmers in Victoria producing some five billion litres of milk from herds totalling a million cows. Approximately 11 per cent of the milk is directed to the liquid milk market whilst the rest is used in the manufacture of products such as butter, cheese, milk powder, and the like. Of Victoria's total milk production, 55 per cent is exported to Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific region. The current farm gate value of production is $1.2 billion, and a further $1.8 billion is added by manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a hollow claim that dairy farmers in Victoria produce milk at a lower cost than those in Europe, the United States, Canada or Japan. I do not know of any other country that can produce quality dairy products as cheaply as Australia. Australian consumers buy the very best dairy foods at prices lower than, or at the very least as low as, anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing about the Victorian dairy industry, and about the industry in Australia as a whole I would think, is that its productivity has increased spectacularly in the last 10 years. In Victoria the average productivity of 4 1/2 thousand litres per cow has increased by 32 per cent since 1985. Total milk production has increased even though the dairy farm work force has halved in the past 15 years&mdash;and isn't that the story of rural life. As well, there has been a 50 per cent reduction in the dairy herd over the last 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have we made tremendous gains in production in the last 10 years but also there are enormous gains in production ahead of us in only the next five years. Production in the year 2001 is predicted to be about 5 1/2 billion litres, which is an increase of 60 per cent since 1985. Quite a  remarkable achievement. My own electorate of Gippsland has participated strongly in this growth in Victoria's premier agricultural industry. In 1993, Gippsland produced 1,520 million litres and in the year 2001 it is forecast to increase to 1,825 million litres. </PARA>

Although I have to concede that he might have marginally more dairy farmers, I believe that Gippsland is the flagship of the Victorian dairy industry and, therefore, the flagship of the Australian dairy industry. I must confess that I do expect retribution from the member for Murray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have dairy farmers in West Gippsland, East Gippsland, Central Gippsland, North Gippsland and South Gippsland.

The Leongatha factory, which is part of the Murray Goulburn Co-operative, is producing about $90 million worth of export produce and $150m worth of domestic produce. Some 850 dairy farmers&mdash;members will appreciate that that is 10 per cent of the total dairy farmers in Victoria&mdash;supply milk to the Murray Goulburn factory in Leongatha. The factory in turn employs about 450 of the 5,500 residents of Leongatha. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can immediately see the importance of the dairy industry and the dairy factory to this medium sized regional town. The story is the same at the Bonlac Foods factory in Toora, which is a small South Gippsland town of about 600 people. The factory has a turnover of approximately $45 million and 80 per cent of its product is sold in the Asian market. This picture is replicated in the Maffra Irrigation Area, where there are some 500 dairy farmers employing over 800 farming families.

I visited Tasmania last week. Tasmanian dairy farmers have peculiar problems because theirs is an island economy, which this government fails to recognise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also would touch on my own electorate which has been hit very hard in the last four years by drought, with the dairy industry in that area having been particularly hard hit. The dairy industry in Queensland and in my own electorate is driven mainly by natural pastures and irrigated crops. Dairy farmers have been forced in the last four years to supplementarily feed their dairy cattle in order to maintain production.

So, whilst they are prepared to bring about pain in the process of change and in the interests of fairer trade rules, it is a great pity that the current federal government from their side of the House will not bite the bullet on other obviously sacred cows. </PARA>

We have to look only at what was in the budget papers last night to see that we desperately need those foreign earnings. Even with the current budget predictions for 1995-96, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said that we will see another deficit in our current account in the next 12 months to the tune of $27 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry's contribution to our export market is extremely significant, and it is also a great provider of jobs, particularly in rural Australia. It is a very efficient industry by world standards. It is a major industry that is geographically spread right across the nation, and it provides substantial jobs and much needed export wealth for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the farmers are very disadvantaged by external factors&mdash;that is, those factors outside their control. It is a pity that the efforts made by farmers in accepting the change is not rewarded by the federal government. Some of the factors that are beyond their control include the labour market, transport costs, the inefficient waterfront and the very closeted and featherbedded coastal shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on Tasmania, and I hope that the Minister for Justice, who is from Tasmania, listens and takes on board some of the concerns of the Tasmanian dairy farmers whom I saw last week in my visit to Tasmania. It is important to understand that Tasmania is very much an island economy. It is not attached to the mainland but is separated by Bass Strait. It has problems which are peculiar to Tasmania. One such problem is the electricity industry, because Tasmania is not able to participate in a national electricity grid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not have it today, and that is the point. We do not have a Bass Strait cable today which allows the Tasmanian electricity industry to participate in a national grid. Tasmania generates an electricity surplus for its requirements, but it cannot export it to anyone. That is one of the problems associated with an island that is separated from the mainland by Bass Strait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity to meet the members of the Tasmanian dairy council at Smithton in the north-west of the state. The north-west of Tasmania is one of the great centres of the state's dairy industry. I had the pleasure of meeting John Oldaker, who is on the Tasmanian dairy council. It is interesting to note that 40 per cent of Tasmania's milk is produced in Circular Head, a region in north-west Tasmania, and 65 per cent is produced in the north-west. The interesting thing is that only 15 per cent of total production in Tasmania is consumed in Tasmania. The rest of it&mdash;85 per cent of their production&mdash;has to be exported, either to the mainland or to overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the district's dairy industry in the north-west of Tasmania is going through very difficult and tough financial times. They have had to contend with high interest rates, inefficiencies on the waterfront&mdash;because they have to export the bulk of their product&mdash;and the drought. At the moment, many of these dairy farmers are wondering why they continue to carry on. Many of them told me that if it were not for a welfare payment they would not be there today. What a sad situation. We have an export industry producing $1.4 billion of our export income, yet the producers are dependent, in many cases, on a welfare payment to put food on the table for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price for milk earned in Tasmania is on average 33c per litre cheaper than that received across Bass Strait in Victoria. As the member for Gippsland said earlier, the industry in his electorate is important and Victoria, as a whole, is a major dairy producer. The point that the Tasmanians made to me is that they receive less for their milk in Tasmania than they do on the mainland. That creates another problem for them in terms of the income they receive, notwithstanding the inefficiencies they have to contend with in getting their products to the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was certainly very disappointing to see so many hardworking farmers in Tasmania really concerned about their families' futures. When I asked them what their main concerns were, straightaway they mentioned transport costs and interest rates. After last night's federal budget, I guess they will be more concerned today than when I was down there last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal budget brought down last night by the Treasurer, using mirrors, smokescreens and snake oil medicine, is certainly going to put increased pressure on interest rates over the next 12 months. No financial commentator in this nation, when they start to delve into the bottom line figures of this budget, is going to believe the snake oil medicine that was dished up here to the Australian people last night. Of course, interest rates is a big factor for farmers, particularly the dairy farmers that I spoke to in Tasmania last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the factors the farmers are very much concerned about is freight costs. They have to contend with exporting the bulk of their product across Bass Strait. It costs as much to freight milk products across Bass Strait as it does to transfer the products between the domestic and the international terminals at the port of Melbourne. That is an appalling indictment on this federal government. I will repeat that point: it costs as much to freight the product across Bass Strait as it does to move it from the domestic terminal to the international terminal at the port of Melbourne. These are the sorts of cost pressures and inefficiencies that the dairy farmers of Tasmania have to contend with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy farmers have already said that they are going to support this bill and take some more pain. What they would like to do, and what they would like see the federal government do, is bite the bullet on waterfront reform and coastal shipping reform. That is why they are so depressed down there: they have a government that does not understand the problems. The farmers are prepared to play their part; the federal government is not prepared to play its part in reforming many work practices and inefficiencies that impact on the daily lives of our dairy farmers. That is why they are wondering whether they will be there next year. They certainly have been asking those questions of themselves and of their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme across Bass Strait, but it is to Tasmania. That is the point they make. I also spoke with dairy farmers from King Island. The minister at the table mentioned King Island during the speech of the member for Gippsland. I think it is acknowledged not only on this side of the House but also on the other side of the House&mdash;in fact, it is acknowledged world wide&mdash;that King Island produces a product which has a worldwide reputation. King Island has also been hit by the inflexible and expensive shipping arrangements. Tasmania is an island economy, but after talking to the people of King Island you realise that they have other problems again because King Island is a very small island off another island. That creates massive problems for the dairy farmers of King Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that when you have a product that has gained world acclaim the federal government would be keen to ensure that the dairy industry could expand operations to increase exports, and that it would make it easier for these producers of King Island to expand their production. The dairy farmers of King Island, like the farmers in Tasmania, are being hit by the inflexible and expensive shipping arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have already pointed out to the minister at the table that once the goods get to the shipping port of Melbourne it costs as much to move them from the domestic terminal to the international terminal to export. The cost to freight across Bass Strait is equal to the cost of moving it probably 50 or 100 metres across a wharf in Melbourne. Who pays? The bottom line in this is that the farmer pays. In this case, it is the dairy farmers of Tasmania who pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers also want to know why they should support the federal government's national competition policy while they are being asked to accept reforms under the national competition legislation which would include exemptions that would add to their costs. Coastal shipping, the waterfront and the labour market are three of the very great impediments to the competitiveness of our exports, small businesses, large businesses, dairy farmers and the farm sector and are two significant impediments to greater efficiency and reducing costs that the federal government will not attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to certainly pay very careful attention to these issues. If he wants to see a dairy sector and an agricultural sector contributing to the export wealth of this nation in the future, these are issues that must be addressed. Quite clearly, if the minister fails to address these issues, particularly in the case of Tasmania, we are going to see our friends across the Tasman, the dairy farmers of New Zealand, who have made these reforms, who have bitten the bullet and gone through the pain and suffering, taking more and more of our markets. We are going to see in Tasmania, and perhaps more broadly across our nation, a situation where our dairy industry will become less and less competitive in this global shopping village as a result of the federal government's inaction in this vital area of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a sad day it will be if we start to see fewer and fewer dairy farmers in this nation when we have wide acclaim for our products, such as the King Island product, and an acknowledged industry which is world class by any standard, disappearing from this nation because the federal government is failing to bite the bullet on three very vital areas of reform which impact on the cost competitiveness of our dairy industry. Those three areas, I repeat, are the waterfront, coastal shipping and transport. I can only hope that the Minister for Transport listens to this. Let us start talking about a level playing field for all, rather than a level playing field with some exemptions for the holy cows that the Labor Party still will not bite the bullet on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill, which is before the House. I am very pleased to be able to speak today on this legislation. This legislation is very timely, given that currently negotiations are taking place internationally on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. I must say as an aside that it is very disappointing that some countries are seemingly wishing to back away from some of their previous commitments to nuclear non-proliferation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that this legislation does not in any way directly flow from those negotiations; rather, it is an attempt&mdash;an attempt we are making in Australia and certainly one which has also occurred in other countries&mdash;to close loopholes in relation to our surveillance of international trade in weapons of mass destruction. The legislation attempts to tie up those loopholes that have not been covered by the customs legislation to prevent Australians or Australian companies from dealing in weapons of mass destruction. That is an aim that I expect all members of this House would support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly flows, as I am advised, from Australia's commitment to and membership of international groups that both monitor and regulate trade in weapons. I am advised the Zangger committee, which was formed in the early 1970s, was formed by countries which are suppliers of nuclear materials with the aim of interpreting the general provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which deal with the control of exports of equipment for use in the production of special fissionable material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand another group called the nuclear suppliers group, which was formed in 1974, has developed guidelines for the export of nuclear aided equipment and technology aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Another group is the missile technology control regime, which was established in 1987. A fourth group known as the Australia group was established by Australia to facilitate the establishment of the chemical weapons treaty and deal with the export of material for the making of chemical weapons until such a treaty comes into force. The group first met in September 1987 and now comprises 25 members constituting 80 per cent of the world's chemical suppliers. The group has developed a list of chemicals which require export controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has certainly been at the forefront in this area. It is clear there is a need for legislation like this simply to close off loopholes that have not been covered by the customs legislation. It has to be emphasised that the customs regulations have so far held us in good stead in this regard. The minister's office advises me that to this date, if any Australian company has been unwittingly dealing in weapons of mass destruction or involved in some sort of incidental trade in that area, it has been very quick to cease that activity when advised by the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would expect that from Australian companies and would not be surprised if that continued, but there is still need for this legislation. I think the best example that has been given to me of what this legislation covers is that, if some Australian company sends a fax overseas for, say, a plan for a nuclear weapon, nothing in Australian current legislation will prevent that. Clearly, we need to prevent that sort of activity, and that is what this legislation is designed to prohibit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is great concern that individuals or terrorist organisations will obtain weapons of mass destruction. I think it is worthwhile stating what the bill defines weapons of mass destruction as. We are talking about not only nuclear weapons, which are probably the first things that come to mind, but also biological and chemical weapons. Those who perpetrated the recent outrage in Oklahoma in the United States would no doubt see no moral bar to using nuclear weapons for their crazed ends because of the way they used conventional weapons in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is very important that we prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In the recent example in Japan, it seems that an urban terrorist group used chemical weapons against a civilian population. Unfortunately, there seems to be a greater proliferation of these weapons. They seem to be coming into the hands of fringe groups more and more, and it is ordinary people who suffer at the hands of these extremist groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while going over some of the detail of the legislation, because it is important. I have to emphasise that the bill enhances the existing customs powers, which have been very effective. It is not a matter of trying to stop the flow of something that is already occurring; it is simply a preventative measure, but it is important. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clause 9</EMPHASIS> provides that where a person supplies goods to another, believing or suspecting on reasonable grounds that the goods may be used in a program for the development, production, acquisition or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction (a `WMD program'), the person is guilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of 8 years. The person is not guilty of an offence if the supply of goods is authorised by a permit granted under<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> clause 13</EMPHASIS> or the Minister has issued the person with a written notice under<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> clause 12</EMPHASIS> stating that the Minister does not believe or suspect that the goods may be used in a WMD program.</PARA>

In the future, Australia will not be exempt from the sort of terrorism we have recently seen around the world. I would love to say it will be, but it will not. We have to play a part to prevent the proliferation of these weapons. Technology, in the production of weapons and with the development of things like fax machines, which make transactions easier, means that wherever you are in the world you will not be able to escape this threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s we were all under the threat of global nuclear war. That was certainly something that was serious. I think everyone would accept that that threat has passed. I would suggest that it has not completely passed, but with the end of the Cold War it is a fair assessment to say that the threat of global nuclear war has passed. However, I think we are under a greater threat from small groups obtaining nuclear and chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, since the end of the Cold War we have also seen an increase in small conflicts. If small nation states do not adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, we may well be in a situation where again certain sections of the population are threatened by the use of nuclear weapons. It is very significant that there has been no use of nuclear weapons in the world since the two bombs were dropped in Japan in 1945. Some credit for that is owed to both the United Nations and the whole plethora of international organisations that have been set up under its auspices to prevent that. Nevertheless, it is a continuing threat that I think we all have to be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might take the opportunity to say a little about delivering weapons of mass destruction. This is something that has concerned me for some time. I welcome the opportunity to say something about it in the House. In the era of the Cold War, emphasis was rightly placed on the issues of deterrence and strategic balance. As I said earlier, everyone was very conscious of the possible horror of nuclear war. It was no exaggeration to say that that could have meant the destruction of civilisation as a whole. But I think what is often forgotten is that the phenomenon that we feared in those times&mdash;that is, the mass destruction of cities&mdash;was not commenced by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The first destruction of a city that occurred in war was perhaps the destruction of Guernica in the Spanish Civil War. Then came the Blitz in London in World War II, and then the Allied bombing of Europe which resulted in fire-bombing of some cities. Dresden, of course, is an example that comes to mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so-called strategic bombing&mdash;and I will get on to that word in a minute&mdash;caused a great deal of destruction. In some ways the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki just followed on from that. Obviously nuclear weapons are weapons of a different sort and contain far more horror, but the reality is that even the bombing by the Allies in World War II caused a great loss of life. Women and children&mdash;innocent people&mdash;were affected. It is something that concerns me and that I think should concern the whole of humankind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are currently celebrating&mdash;if I might use that word&mdash;the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. It is interesting to think about how that war affected people. I recommend to honourable members a book by a British historian, Paul Fussell, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wartime</EMPHASIS>, which sets out the effect of World War II on America and the United Kingdom. It is worth quoting in relation to the question of strategic bombing because it is very significant that the so-called strategic bombing in World War II was not as strategic as people thought: it was very inaccurate and very indiscriminate&mdash;and therefore, of course, affected civilian populations. That is the point I am trying to make. I quote from the book to illustrate the point that the bombing was inaccurate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact was that bombing proved so grossly inaccurate that the planes had to fly well within anti-aircraft range to hit anywhere near the target, and even then they very often missed it entirely. As the war went on, "precision bombing" became a comical oxymoron relished by bomber crews with a sense of black humor. It became obvious to everyone except the home folks reading <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Life</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saturday Evening Post</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is an American reference&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that although you could destroy lots of things with bombs, they weren't necessarily the things you had in mind. Navigation through winds and clouds and turbulence presented such problems that as early as August, 1941, it was clear to even the most naive in RAF Bomber Command that on a typical mission "only one in ten of the bombers found its way to within five miles of the assigned target." In the first German raids on London, when 500 tons of bombs were dropped, only half fell on the land at all, and only 30 tons hit London. The popular broadcaster J. B. Priestly imagined egotistically that one of the main German targets in this raid was Broadcasting House, where he performed, when actually the Germans were lucky to hit anything in London at all.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have concentrated on the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, biological and chemical weapons, which are easier to make and cheaper to build, are being built right now. To an aggressor these weapons are much superior and considered to be very good weapons. Nuclear weapons destroy everything, kill everyone and create a lot of mess. If you have a biological or chemical weapon and all the infrastructure remains intact, an aggressor can walk into the community and take over. In a sense, they are superior to nuclear weapons. </PARA>

I believe our defence forces are training to protect themselves, which is important. I will read part of a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which was written after the gas attack in Tokyo earlier this year. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terrible incident in Tokyo brings to mind a visit that I made to the army's School of Military Engineering in Sydney's southern suburbs in 1982.</PARA>

<PARA>Since this bill was introduced in November 1994 we have had the Oklahoma bombing, the Tokyo gas attack and, in the last few days, there has been a suggestion that France might resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. There are examples of what we are talking about now happening all the time. No-one actually knows the full cost of producing nuclear weapons. In a speech I gave on 31 August 1993, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Sunday program recently&mdash;I think it was the week before last&mdash;it was reported that four nuclear smugglers had been caught with 600 grams of radioactive material. The material was uranium 235.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This television program showed an army officer from the Russian military selling this material. It costs approximately $1 million per kilogram for weapons grade material. The material was independently analysed. It was not just taken to be that type of material. Independent government analysis found it to consist of 70 per cent uranium 238, 10 per cent uranium 235 and 20 per cent plutonium 239. It was weapons grade material.</PARA>
<PARA>A terrorist group can, if it wants, make a nuclear bomb if it can buy the material. That material is being sold in Russia right now. It does not take too much engineering skill to manufacture, so I have been told. However, that is the expensive way. The cheaper way is to go into biological and chemical weapons, which are cheap and easy to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a couple of examples of the type and cost of weapons available. In the biological area there is a weapon called ricin toxin, derived from the seeds of the castor oil plant. It kills by poisoning the blood, causing the circulatory system to collapse. Anyone in any sort of research institution who has this plant available can produce it. It costs about $10,000 to $20,000 to produce 800 kilograms, enough to kill people within a one square mile area. Botulinum toxin, which is produced in a laboratory, causes respiratory paralysis leading to death. Eighty grams will inflict heavy casualties over a one square mile area and costs about $10,000 to $20,000. With anthrax you only need eight grams, costing about $10,000 to $20,000, to kill people in a one square mile area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we have heard about sarin nerve gas being used in Japan. You need about 800 kilograms, costing about $10,000 to $20,000, to kill people in a one square mile area, and it causes death within 15 minutes. You can buy the ingredients of this particular gas anywhere and mix them together; you only need a chemist. Tabun nerve gas kills by suffocating, paralysing the chest muscles and interfering with the chemical signals that pass between nerve cells. Eight hundred kilograms of tabun nerve gas kills people within one square mile. Once again you can buy the ingredients for that nerve gas today&mdash;they are quite legal. They are available to anyone with any sort of chemical knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a new phenomenon. Back in 1972 an American fascist group called the Order of the Rising Sun&mdash;I do not know why the rising sun comes into it; a lot of these fascist groups have a fixation with it&mdash;had 36 kilograms of typhoid bacteria which it was going to place in the water supply of mid-western American cities. So the problem is not new; it has been around. It will be hard for governments to stop these extremist groups from obtaining these perfectly legal commercial products which can be used in the production of nerve gases. I have never taken the time to bother to find out, but if I were some sort of a terrorist group it would be quite easy to find out what I could buy&mdash;I think they are fertilisers and other things&mdash;mix them together and come up with these gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nerve gas, or chemical warfare, was not extensively used in World War II against the troops. However, the Germans used it against the Jewish people and other people throughout Europe. I believe that the British had, as a last resort, a whole pile of chemical weapons or nerve gases to be used if they were overrun. The British, Americans and Russians, I believe, still have these chemical weapons. They are starting to destroy them. Russia has the largest stockpile of chemical weapons of any nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, chemical weapons are not as bad or as lethal as biological weapons. We do not hear much about these biological weapons because I think perhaps everyone is too terrified to look at them. It has been stated that if a virus, such as Ebola Zaire, were able to be made into a weapon, it would kill 90 per cent of the human race within a few weeks. If this one virus were spread around at various spots, 90 per cent of the human race would be killed within four to five weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great concerns about chemical and biological weapons. They cannot really be controlled. None of us can stop the manufacture of them. We cannot control them&mdash;and ratbag groups throughout the world will undoubtedly use them. As I said, we only have to look at what has happened in the last few weeks. This particular bill calls on the government and industry to make certain they do not supply these materials or ingredients to these groups. But how we really police that, I just do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel that, even though it is a sort of taboo subject, and no-one likes to get into chemical or biological weapons, we should be doing a lot more research here in Australia. We have the scientists to enable us to do it. I do not know whether we have the facilities, but perhaps we have. We should be looking at this issue and trying to come up with some sort of antidotes and countermeasures to these particular viruses and to chemical or biological weapons that are well known and can be produced by these terrorist groups. If we come up with a solution, it should be given to the whole world freely. In that way, these ratbag groups that are around the place would be countered, and there would not be that incentive to manufacture these things, because they would be neutralised, as I said, by some antidote or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a major problem. We have been very lucky: we have had 50 years of non-use of weapons of mass destruction&mdash;that is, nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs. But that has come about because governments have been able to control the technology and the supply of the material, which is usually uranium or plutonium, and because most countries have not had the money to be able to produce these sorts of weapons. No-one knows what it costs to make a nuclear bomb. As I said before, there have been some figures. You can buy the material, but there is quite a lot of engineering and other work involved in the manufacture of these weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These other forms of mass destruction are easy to produce and are well known or could be well known; if people put their minds to it, they can find out. I believe that now you can plug into the Internet and find out how to make these things. So we have to do a lot more research. I trust this bill will assist in a small way in controlling the making of these things. I hope that the government will look to research being done in that area and, as I said before, if it comes up with an answer, provide that research freely to the whole world. I believe we could do that here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important bill. The other issue about which I know discussions are going on at the moment is the non-proliferation treaty. Even though the non-proliferation treaty was signed back in 1970 and we hear about the reduction which has occurred in the nuclear arsenal, the actual weapon states have increased their arsenals by a huge amount. Since 1970 there have been 75,000 new nuclear weapons deployed and hundreds of nuclear tests conducted. So we have to look at that area. It is not something that has all been solved and is all sweetness and light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is only a couple of months away. Huge populations were killed when those bombs were dropped. Some of those populations had a connection with the war that was under way at that time, but the majority had nothing to do with it. Yes, those nuclear bombs which were dropped back in August 1945 put an end to the war in the Pacific, which was good. But they also killed thousands and thousands of people unnecessarily&mdash;and people are still dying from the effects of those nuclear bombs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive Australian governments, both Labor and Liberal&mdash;we should give credit where it is due&mdash;have entered into international treaties and, in what has usually been a bipartisan atmosphere, have gone on to enact legislation in the parliament that has the full consent of the Senate and the House of the Representatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government is committed to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. One example of that commitment is our part in working actively to strengthen and extend indefinitely the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Indeed, we have taken a leading role in urging the early completion of the comprehensive test ban treaty&mdash;the CTBT.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 Australia took a leading role in gaining consensus support for the CTBT resolution for the first time, which, as anyone who knows the UN would realise, is no small feat. This allowed negotiations on this treaty to commence.

It is obvious that Australia has played a significant role in securing peace and this bill continues that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is already a party to three international treaties which are concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was ratified by Australia on 23 January 1973. It is substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxic Weapons and on their Destruction was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977 and is substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these three treaties and their associated legislation, which place limits on the use and transfer of chemical, nuclear and bacteriological material, Australia is involved in at least four international groups which aim to control the international transfer of such materials. The first group of which Australia is a member is the Zangger Committee, which was formed in the early 1970s. It was formed by countries that are suppliers of nuclear materials and has the aim of interpreting the general provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which deal with the control of exports of equipment for use in the production of `special fissionable material'. It has developed a list of equipment the export of which should be subject to safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group is the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which was formed in 1974.

In 1992, the group agreed on guidelines for transfers of nuclear related dual use equipment, material and related technology.

The Australia Group first met in September 1987 and now comprises approximately 25 members constituting 80 per cent of the world's chemical suppliers. The group has developed a list of chemicals which require export controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to meet its international obligations imposed by both treaties and these more informal international groups, Australia has enacted legislation as mentioned above to deal with nuclear, chemical and bacteriological material within Australia. However, it is impractical to require export permits for common commercial exports which have legitimate uses in other countries but which may also assist in the construction of weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is designed to fill that gap by putting the onus on exporters not to export such goods if they know or suspect on reasonable grounds that they will be used to assist in the development of weapons of mass destruction. The bill also covers the provision of services, such as expertise and the technology necessary to make such weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, clauses 4 and 8 provide that the bill will extend to the external territories and that it will bind the Commonwealth as well as the states and the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island. This will help to close a loophole in the legislation that might otherwise allow the external territories to be used as a base for the export of weapons technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 provides that the bill will apply not only to acts or omissions in Australia but also to acts or omissions done outside Australia by Australian citizens, people who ordinarily reside in Australia and bodies incorporated in Australia. In international law, Australia would not have the jurisdiction to legislate in relation to things that happen outside Australia unless it had this connection with Australian citizens, residents or companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general prohibition on the provision or export of goods or services is also covered in clause 9 which provides that, where a person supplies goods to another, believing or suspecting on reasonable grounds that the goods may be used in a program for the development, production, acquisition or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction, better known as a WMD program, the person is guilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of eight years. A person is not guilty of an offence if the supply of goods is authorised by a permit granted under clause 13 or the minister has issued the person with a written notice under clause 12 stating that the minister does not believe or suspect that the goods may be used in a WMD program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 attributes the belief or suspicion of a director, employee or agent, acting within his or her authority, to the relevant corporation, unless the corporation proves that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct. If a corporation is convicted, section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 allows the court to impose a fine upon it up to five times the maximum fine which could be imposed on an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person wishing to supply the goods or services suspects that they might be used in a WMD program, clause 12 provides that that person can request the minister to provide a written statement as to whether the minister believes or suspects that this is the case. The minister must provide such a written statement as soon as possible. If the minister states that he or she does not have reason to believe or suspect that the goods or services may be used for a WMD program, then the person providing the goods or services is protected from prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, the minister does have reason to believe or suspect that goods or services may be used to assist a WMD program, the person who wishes to provide such goods or services may still apply for a permit under clause 13 and the regulations. If the minister is satisfied that the supply or export of the goods or services would not be contrary to Australia's international treaty obligations or national interest, he or she may grant a permit for the supply or export of the goods or services. The permit may be subject to conditions and may be revoked. A permit is also protection against prosecution under clauses 9 to 11. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notice prohibiting the supply or export of goods or services is also covered. In addition to the general prohibition on supplying or exporting goods or services which may assist a WMD program, clause 14 allows the minister to send out notices prohibiting a person from supplying or exporting the goods or services to a person or place, or placing conditions upon such activity. The minister may only issue such notices if he or she has reason to believe or suspect that the goods or services might be used to assist a WMD program and the minister considers a permit could not be given under clause 13. A notice lasts for some 12 months. It is an offence for a person to knowingly supply or export goods or services contrary to a notice. The penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There  are  provisions  for  the  forfeiture of goods. In addition to criminal penalties, clause 17 provides that if a person exports or supplies goods contrary to this bill they will be forfeited to the Commonwealth. Clause 20 provides that the Attorney-General's consent must be given for the prosecution of an offence under this bill. This does not prevent a person from being arrested, charged and remanded in custody for such an offence. However, if proceedings are not continued within a reasonable time, the courts may discharge and release the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill imposes an additional burden on companies to become aware of the ultimate use of goods or services that they might provide or export. Although the criminal provisions require a level of intent of `belief or suspicion', a jury could attribute `suspicion' to a company if it held or had access to information which indicates that the goods or services might be used for a WMD program, even if no-one in the company had actually turned their mind to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company must also take care that one of its directors, employees or agents does not hold such suspicions without alerting the responsible person in the company; otherwise the knowledge of the director, employee or agent could be attributed to the company, resulting in conviction, a fine and confiscation of the goods. This burden on companies should be balanced against the importance of limiting the capacity of countries to construct weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not obvious what is a `reasonable ground' for suspicion. Is it enough that the country to which the goods and services are to be exported is rumoured to be developing weapons of mass destruction? At least under this bill a company can get a definitive statement from the minister to clear up any grey areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I acknowledge that this added burden may present something of a problem for a company, I do not think it should be used as an impediment to this bill. Indeed, a responsible company should want to know&mdash;or at least be reasonably certain&mdash;that its product was not going to be used in a weapons program. The principle behind the bill far outweighs these small problems associated with its enactment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to identify and describe, for regulatory purposes, all items that might be used in a WMD program. Some items may be identified but, because of their widespread commercial application, it would be impracticable to control them under the customs regulations. Once in regulations, all exports of these items will require a permit, which would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the licensing authority as well as for industry. However, the government would still want to have the authority to stop such items from being exported to a destination considered to be a WMD proliferation risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The customs regulations also cannot control the supply of goods and technology by an Australian overseas, or the provision of services or other assistance to a WMD program. Services or assistance could, for example, take the form of a consultancy contract to provide technical, operational or management advice to a WMD program, as well as financial assistance, brokering the supply of materials, or specialised training. It would also cover the transmission of information by telephone, fax and other forms which cannot be covered under the customs regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I guess this will cause the greatest problem for those companies it will affect. A number of similarly placed countries have responded to this problem by the development of the `catch-all' or `safety net' provisions as an element of the barriers to WMD proliferation; for example, the United States and Germany. Although it can take different forms, essentially it works in two ways. It puts an onus on a person not to export goods or provide a service or other assistance intentionally or recklessly to a WMD program. It also provides the government with a mechanism to prevent the export of goods or the provision of a service or other assistance to an actual or possible WMD program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there is a wide range of goods and services that can be used in a WMD program and which have legitimate commercial uses and are not specifically controlled under existing legislation, it would be inconsistent with Australia's strong support for the international non-proliferation regimes and strong opposition to WMD proliferation for the government not to have all necessary authority to prevent the provision of goods and services to WMD programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a theoretical problem for Australia. It is important to note that there have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD programs, and these activities were not specifically covered by Australia's existing non-proliferation legislation; hence the need for this bill before the House at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) introduced this bill in the Senate, he did mention that the companies involved had been cooperative and had ceased the activities in question when the government informed them of its concerns, which is appreciated. But leaving it up to the discretion of the company is an inadequate safeguard. We cannot conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly as involvement in a WMD program can bring significant financial benefits to a company. Hence the need to provide clear legislative backing for the government's comprehensive WMD non-proliferation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The prohibitions under the bill would apply where the person involved knows of or suspects a connection with a WMD program. The bill provides for a ministerial certificate to be issued prohibiting relevant activities in cases where government authorities are aware of the risk of the potential contribution to a WMD program but the exporter is not aware of the connection or has either ignored or not appreciated warning signs. An important element of the bill is the provision for a mechanism to be established for companies and individuals to obtain written guidance from the government on the risk, or not, of a particular planned transaction contributing to a WMD program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not meant to be the prime or sole barrier against possible Australian assistance to the proliferation of WMD. The customs regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation of WMD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this bill will ensure the continuance of Australia's proud record in working for peace in the global environment. It is a record built on a commitment to the principles of freedom and peace. I think most, if not all, Australians would applaud the intent behind this legislation and would not want to see their country, unwittingly or otherwise, assist in the growth of such terrifying weaponry, particularly with the somewhat uncertain international situation in place around the world today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peace agreements have been reached in several of the world's hot spots like the Middle East and others. These developments are very welcome, but the world must be on guard against the growth of other threats with the capacity to use nuclear weaponry in their own arsenals or to gain access to weapons or the technology required to manufacture weapons. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to support this bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to debate the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill&mdash;a bill that I note has broad support across the chamber and also in the other house. The area of weapons of mass destruction is complex, as speakers have noted today. A range of different weaponry has to be considered&mdash;nuclear, biological and chemical. We are also looking at the systems of delivery, such as missile systems, and how they can be utilised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing about a lot of these weapons is that, as technology improves, the devastation that can be caused also improves. Many of these weapons, as more is known about them, can be made from many and varied substances. Often these substances are easily gained and often they have legitimate uses, but in circumstances when they are used incorrectly by people with malevolent intent they can lead to the development of weaponry which can cause extreme devastation. A recent example of a terrorist act&mdash;although not occurring on a country basis&mdash;was the incident in Japan. Effectively, a weapon of mass destruction was used in a domestic situation and the devastation was appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a party to three international treaties which are concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was ratified by Australia on 23 January 1973. It is substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, which was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, is substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, which was ratified on 6 May 1994 and on which I spoke in this chamber, has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these three treaties and their associated legislation, which place limits on the use and transfer of chemical, nuclear and bacteriological material, Australia is involved in at least four international groups which aim to control the international transfer of such materials. The first group of which Australia is a member is the Zangger committee, which was formed in the early 1970s. It was formed by countries which are suppliers of nuclear materials with the aim of interpreting the general provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which deal with the control of exports of equipment for use in the production of special fissionable material. It has developed a list of equipment, the export of which should be subject to safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group is the nuclear suppliers group, which was formed in 1974. It comprises most European countries, the US, Canada, Japan and Australia. The group has developed guidelines for the export of nuclear related equipment and technology aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In 1992 the group agreed on guidelines for transfers of nuclear related, dual-use equipment, material and related technology. These guidelines are aimed at controlling material which has legitimate non-nuclear uses, but if diverted could make a major contribution to nuclear explosive and unsafeguarded nuclear fuel activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group is the missile technology control regime, which was established in 1987. It comprises a group of countries which have agreed to a basic set of guidelines on the export of missile technology. Participating countries have agreed to incorporate these guidelines in their national export regulations. In July 1990 Australia joined this group, which now numbers 25 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth group is known as the Australia group. This group was established by Australia to facilitate the establishment of a chemical weapons treaty and to deal with the export of material for the making of chemical weapons until such a treaty comes into force. The Australia group first met in September 1987 and now comprises approximately 25 members, constituting 80 per cent of the world's chemical suppliers. The group has developed a list of chemicals which require export controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to meet its international obligations imposed by both treaties and these more informal international groups, Australia has enacted legislation to deal with nuclear, chemical and bacteriological material within Australia. It has also imposed export controls through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations under the Customs Act 1901. However, it is impractical to require export permits for common commercial exports which have legitimate usages in other countries but which may also assist in the construction of weapons of mass destruction. This bill is designed to fill the gap by putting the onus on exporters not to export such goods if they know or  suspect on reasonable grounds that those goods will be used to assist in the development of weapons of mass destruction. This bill also covers the provision of services, such as expertise in the technology necessary to make such weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There  is  a  range  of  reasons  for  this,  as I outlined earlier in my speech, but I would like to note some recent examples on the issue of proliferation which I think really do highlight the need for this sort of action to be taken. One reason for Iraq's imports of nuclear materials and technology and of materials for chemical weapons in the years before the invasion of Kuwait that caused so much concern was that a large amount of the imports came in from Western countries such as Germany and France, which have been regarded as possessing sufficiently sophisticated controls to prevent illegal traffic taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pakistan has been active in its search for nuclear materials. For example, in June 1984 US customs officials intercepted the export of 50 krytrons&mdash;fast triggers to start a nuclear fission detonation&mdash;from the US to Pakistan. The Israeli government has admitted that between 1979 and 1983 it acquired 80 krytrons from the same Massachusetts manufacturer. In 1988 a West German company was caught shipping tritium to Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are just examples of intercepted exports. A great deal of other materials have escaped detection. As Duncan Campbell stated in an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Statesman and Society</EMPHASIS> in April 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . international controls in the transfer of nuclear technology are limited.</PARA>
<PARA>A Carnegie report published in 1990 claimed Pakistan, India, Brazil, Argentina and Iraq have been able to build or expand nuclear weapons capabilities from supplier countries and said West Germany was the `weak link' in the international export system and must tighten export laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, in September 1994, the CIA accused Iran of trying, despite having signed the non-proliferation treaty, to acquire nuclear and missile technology from the West to build nuclear weapons. In August 1994, a Greenpeace report claimed the USA had illegally exported plutonium processing technology to Japan. There are many examples of this nature. They really do highlight the fact that this is an area of real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the issue of proliferation in the nuclear context there are, as I was taught at university, two basic approaches. There is horizontal proliferation and vertical proliferation. Vertical proliferation was normally meant to relate to what was years ago known as the superpower race, where there were more and more technically sophisticated delivery systems and technically sophisticated, speedy and efficient weaponry&mdash;which, effectively, upped the ante with respect to the arms race between the then USSR and the United States of America. Horizontal proliferation relates to technology moving across to other countries that presently do not have those capabilities. In the current circumstances, that is the most pressing concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger with the development of horizontal proliferation&mdash;or of more nuclear-capable powers&mdash;is that it may bring about a situation where the position of the control over nuclear weapons is in the hands of more unstable regimes and more unstable leaders. Therefore, the danger is that regional conflicts that normally would be bloody and quite horrifying could, in fact, trigger more international conflicts on the basis of the usage of nuclear weapons in particular but also weapons of mass destruction in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A conference is going on at the moment in New York looking at the extension and review of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. There has been debate at that conference and during the lead-up to that conference about the extension of that treaty, the position of the signatories to that treaty and the actual operation of that treaty. There are major concerns from a range of non-nuclear powers about not only horizontal proliferation but also the actions of the five known nuclear powers in terms of their requirements under the treaty to effectively disarm themselves over time. That should lead to a situation where there are less nuclear weapons available around the world and, therefore, less likelihood of major problems occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greenpeace recently released a letter that I received detailing its information on the current state of play of the five nuclear powers on their nuclear weapons and their development. I think that forms the basis of some of the concerns that were raised at that conference, and which have been discussed throughout the world, about how effective the non-proliferation treaty is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's newest nuclear weapons consist of two nuclear-powered ballistic submarines, which carry twelve 1,700 kilometre range missiles, each armed with a single 200 to 300 kiloton nuclear warhead. More submarines  are under construction. Two land based missile systems are also thought to be under development, one for deployment in the late 1990s and the other one for around 2010. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">France plans to spend 130 billion francs,  the equivalent of $US22 billion, on its nuclear forces between 1995 and the end of the century. The range and number of nuclear warheads on submarines will be increased. The M45 missile is under development and is expected to carry up to six new 100 kiloton TN75 warheads with a range of 6,000 kilometres. A new nuclear armed strategic bomber is scheduled for 2005, with adapted missile systems on board. A long-range cruise missile is also planned, in the most recent six-year defence plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that has come out in the last few days with the election of the new President of France, Jacques Chirac, is the fact that he has left open the issue of nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. I am thankful to say that this has produced a reaction against that position from all parties within Australia. It is a general issue where there is absolute agreement that this should not occur. There is a real concern that the French President intends to move down that track. I personally urge that the testing of nuclear weapons, which the French maintain is basically benign, would more appropriately be done somewhere closer to Marseilles than to Mururoa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Russia is continuing to modernise its nuclear forces with new missiles and warheads currently in production. There were some 405 SS-25 ICBM missiles at the end of 1993. Military officials recently announced that by 2003 another 400 to 500 ICBM SS-25 missiles could be produced. One of the major concerns internationally over the potential for horizontal proliferation relates to the disintegration of the old Soviet Union. We now have a lot of what is, by current standards, not state-of-the-art technology&mdash;state-of-the-art nuclear weapons&mdash;but, with the disintegration of that regime, there are certainly numerous reports around about that technology being on the market and about there being the capacity and existence of plans and developments in the provision of that material to interested powers throughout the world. Extending proliferation on a horizontal basis is potentially extremely dangerous to a range of countries and for the overall stability of the international regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom has increased its number of warheads from 32 on Polaris submarines to up to 96 on the new Trident class submarines. The Trident submarines first went into active service last year. Each missile will have twice the range and will be able to hit far more targets with much greater accuracy and explosive yield than Polaris. Each warhead will have an explosive power of 100 kilotons. So a submarine with six warheads will have a killing capacity equivalent to 640 Hiroshima bombs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of multiple warheads, one missile delivers the actual explosive yield, but a number of bombs are associated with that missile. That missile can deliver a number of warheads. When it comes over the target, it can separate those effective small missiles out and land those bombs in a range of areas; therefore, maximising damage to a much larger area and hitting a number of targets with the one missile vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since signing the NPT, the US has conducted 500 nuclear tests. I was shocked to hear that. Despite making reductions in present weapons there are plans to update current systems or develop new warheads. Washington's plans to simulate nuclear weapons testing in laboratories undermine the concept of a comprehensive test ban treaty. The United States maintains on routine alert 3,400 warheads on MX missiles and the US military plans show that they will maintain nuclear defences well into the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conference that is occurring at the moment there is a debate about the plans of the various nuclear powers and the need to put as much pressure as possible on them to honour their obligations under the treaty and move to a situation where we get a less nuclear world through their taking constructive action to reduce their arsenals and to slow down the development of new technology. Hopefully that will lead to a better and safer world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate relates to the question of a permanent, indefinite extension of the treaty, which has been supported by Australia and a range of Western countries. The alternative view is that we go for a 25-year extension of the treaty in order to put a bit more pressure on the nuclear powers to honour their obligations under the treaty. That debate is quite detailed. As I understand it, at the moment a majority of countries will support indefinite extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are arguments both ways on this. I am not convinced either way. I would say that there needs to be continual debate on issues concerning nuclear technology, there needs to be a continual debate about the need for all countries to recognise the dangers that are associated with proliferation, both on a horizontal and a vertical front, and there needs to be developed a consensus to make sure that all nuclear powers and all countries which wish to become nuclear powers realise the folly of their ways and move to a situation where we can develop a safer world for us and our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that will be the result of this conference, but I do not think it will end there. There needs to be further work. I am sure that this government can play an important role internationally in helping to push to a situation where we can get away from the issue of horizontal proliferation and the further development of the arsenals of the major nuclear powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is part of a necessary development of our regime with respect to ensuring that the dangers of weapons of mass destruction are minimised. We can never effectively stop the development of some versions of weapons of mass destruction if a regime or organisation is determined to move down that track, but we can make it as difficult as possible. We can ensure that we have detection regimes in place to assist in the discovering of any action in that direction and we can work to a situation where, even if someone does develop such weaponry, it is the smallest possible weaponry with respect to the damage that it can cause in terms of its explosive yield or poisonous content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House. It is a good bill and a necessary part of developing the international regime which we need to avoid the further development of these weapons systems on an international basis. I am pleased to see that the bill has broad support within the parliament. I look forward to its speedy passage and I hope it goes some way to assisting in the development of a fair, just and reasonable regime to ensure that weapons of this nature are never used in the future. </PARA>

Internationally, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the deception that the suppression of human rights in a wide range of countries&mdash;eastern Europe and other continents&mdash;would end, there was perhaps an overstatement of hope on the weapons front.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps there were very nasty aspects to the international scene back in that earlier period such as the very high emphasis on defence and military expenditure, the whole military industrial complex that developed in the United States and the USSR, and the utilisation by both powers of national liberation movements to their own international foreign policy interests.

They were dependent upon them in a very real sense in regard to conflicts with neighbours. They were very dependent upon them in regard to personnel and infrastructure support in a lot of their military hopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then we have seen the propensity of these countries to essentially tell the rest of the world to go jump and to pursue their own efforts and purchases. Often they have sought to go around the customs rules and regulations of various countries to penetrate and gain control behind the scenes of the corporations of overseas countries that have an interest in this weapons field. In the last few weeks, we have seen the emphasis by the United States of Russian contacts with Iran to seek these purchases for their own interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech on 27 April this year titled `The price of leadership', Anthony Lake, the Assistant to the President of the United States for National Security Affairs, made a point about the amount of money the United States has devoted in the former Soviet Union to try to ensure that people previously employed in the armaments industry who are looking for employment and are basically down on their backsides were not attracted to becoming mercenaries for regimes such as Iran. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are spending $35 million over three years to employ thousands of weapon scientists from the former Soviet Union on civilian research projects. That helps keep them off the nuclear labour market and from selling their skills to Iraq or Iran.</PARA>
<PARA>That gives you some indication of the dimensions of the problems. Equally, as we have seen with the recent Oklahoma bombing, there is perhaps too high a concern with privacy regulations within a number of Western nations. There is a situation now on the Internet whereby we can see extreme paramilitary forces in the United States basically linking in and giving advice to each other in regard to weapons manufacture and their desire to take on the United States supposedly dominated by some world conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another problem. The proliferation of advice and the technological changes make it far more foreseeable for a wider range of smaller groups to hold society to ransom. An article in the 5 September 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aviation Week and Space Technology</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Better designs invented as early as 1951 and now discussed in unclassified literature make it likely that a one-kiloton bomb could be made using as little as one kilogram of plutonium, according to the NRDC report. This bomb could devastate a city centre over a 40 block area according to the NRDC.</PARA>
<PARA>That gives us some indication of the need for this type of legislation. Other speakers in this debate have mentioned matters such as the seizure of material from Russian nationals, particularly in West Germany and on Lufthansa flights. At the end of the day most of the material they found was not really of the dimensions that should have led to the sort of media coverage it received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a few other issues internationally which go to reasons for this legislation. One is the Matrix Churchill scandal in the United Kingdom. Without public knowledge, ministers in that government relaxed the requirements for Iran and Iraq with regard to the export of material that was later to be used against the UN allied effort in the war. Having secretly undertaken to do that and having given the nod to private sector companies, they then sought to use parliamentary privilege and public privacy to undermine the judiciary's investigation of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During  that  time  we  had&mdash;and  I  cited this earlier&mdash;the purchase by Iraqi nationals of UK corporations as a front for their efforts to undermine the formal export requirements of the United Kingdom Customs. The Technology and Development Group was purchased in 1987. They then systematically purchased other United Kingdom engineering firms, including Matrix Churchill. A branch of the Italian corporation Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro, without head office authorisation, underwrote Matrix Churchill to provide die-making equipment for the Iraqis. They also sought to purchase the Ulster based Lear Fan Aerospace Company. This was a systematic attempt to purchase UK based companies and thereby get around the regulations. This activity led to prosecution of three businessmen. This is the kind of activity that this legislation is attempting to tackle. Six days before the Kuwait war, machine tools for fuses for missiles and artillery shells were still being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that even when this legislation is in place it will not answer the total picture. There has to be parliamentary oversight and there has to be expertise in the Public Service to make sure that we are up with the game. In an article by Mark Phythian and Walter Little in the July 1993 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Affairs</EMPHASIS> they stated in regard to this UK scandal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament proved ineffective for a number of reasons, among them governmental information superiority, the inherent weakness of the Opposition in the defence field and the use of procedures which favour the executive branch. Throughout ministers and their civil servants were economical with the actuality relating to opaque language half truths and on occasions outright untruths.</PARA>
<PARA>We can pass all the legislation in the world, but unless the people who have to police it are up with the latest technology and information and unless parliament oversees what the government is doing then there can be a nod and wink from the government and public servants to the private sector indicating that, at the end of the day, the material gain for the country is more important than the principle behind this type of legislation. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian</EMPHASIS> of 18 February 1995 it was said of this investigation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The judge is certain to criticise Whitehall's prevailing culture of secrecy, dissembling, and cynicism. He will criticise the way ministers, supported by civil servants, adopt a patronising attitude towards Parliament. He will criticise Customs officers and the Attorney-General, for the way they mishandled the MATRIX CHURCHILL prosecution; ministers, for trying to suppress evidence crucial to the defence; Government lawyers, for interfering in prosecution witness statements; civil servants for misleading the court; officials, for ignoring key intelligence reports, ministers for not asking for intelligence reports, and the intelligence agencies for not ensuring their reports go to the right people.</PARA>
<PARA>These are some of the dimensions of the problems we face in trying to ensure that we avoid the export of these kinds of materials. Another article on the same matter of the oversight that has to occur was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent on Sunday</EMPHASIS> of August 1990. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As The Independent on Sunday revealed a fortnight ago, an Iraqi-owned British company, Technology and Development Group, has been involved in supplying sophisticated machine tools, which could be used in the production of missile casings, via Libya to IRAQ. Defence industry sources have also said that TDG, based in Chiswick, west London, has been involved in procuring uranium oxide, and electronic vacuum tubes, which can be used in gas centrifuges, which separate fissile material from non-fissile uranium waste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigations into the company's activities also identified a connection between TDG and the Iraqi director of two other British companies&mdash;Meed International and TEG&mdash;which have arranged for British engineering companies to equip the Iraqi military base at Al-Hillah, near Baghdad. The Observer journalist, Farzad Bazoft, was arrested and later executed for investigating an explosion at Al-Hillah, where missile research is thought to be taking place.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, they penetrated British companies. British ministers were not awake to the long-term potential of the exports of these kinds of materials disguised as kindergarten equipment and other such subterfuges. Not only has this been happening in the United Kingdom but also, in the context of Iraq, a large number of German companies which are household names&mdash;Messerschmitt; Thyssen, in the steel industry; Ferrostaal, in engineering&mdash;were investigated by West German authorities for their own very deliberate assistance and collusion in Iraqi armament policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other parts of eastern Europe which are very dependent upon the defence industry, which was previously a very high employer, have been found to be colluding. In 1989 Kintex, a Bulgarian company with very heavy employment, was found to be making $43 million a year for facilities that were aiding Iraqi ambitions. In 1992, it made $100 million worth of sales to Libya, the former Yugoslavia and Iraq. In the case of this company, this was done through false papers indicating that materials were going to the Bolivian defence department when, in actual fact, they were going to former Yugoslavian governments, and they were avoiding the embargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation is worth while. It attempts to make sure that there are no loopholes for Australian companies that are more inclined to worry about the dollar than the proliferation of this problem internationally. It ensures that companies cannot avoid responsibility by the veil that individual directors or managers made decisions which were not known to the company. It gives the government the ability to give approval where materials are not perceived as adding to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, there must be continued surveillance to ensure that we do not have a repetition of what we have seen, particularly in a number of western European countries. Legislation was ignored by the executive and there was not enough expertise in the bureaucracy to ensure that the legislation was enforced. I wish to quote from an article by J. Laurance in the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orbis</EMPHASIS> of spring 1989. The article, which is headed `New gun running', reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless agencies are staffed to enforce these rules, people seeking to bend or circumvent the rules will conclude the control effort is not credible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very little encouragement was given to those who sought to control the negative effects of arms transfers through the painstaking task of analysing individual cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation is necessary and is in line with Australia's broad effort in these fronts, internationally acclaimed, but we must ensure that it is not just some writing on a piece of paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1995. Let me say clearly, though, at the outset that I am not particularly pleased that a debate of this kind to achieve these purposes should be held in any type of civilised society. This legislation is designed to ensure that Australia participates with other civilised nations of the world to ensure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferated throughout the world. Hopefully they will cease to be stocked and cease to be used. We are talking about weapons which otherwise civilised countries often use against themselves or others to pursue the mass destruction of humankind&mdash;the men, the women and the kids who are the victims of those weapons&mdash;and also to bring about the destruction of human physical achievements. It includes nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, biological weapons and their missile delivery systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with this question, as in connection with many other questions of a similar kind, Australia's record and role has been generally commendable. It has generally been moral and effective. Australia has accepted obligations under international treaties and conventions which in a sense are supplementary to the types of provisions which we are seeking to pursue with this legislation. We are, for example, a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to the biological and toxin weapons convention and, when it comes into force, the chemicals weapons convention. The commitment that Australia accepts is that we will not produce, store or use the types of weapons which are identified within those treaty arrangements and within the legislation being considered at present. We undertake to control exports of both materials and technology. We are a member of the international export control arrangements and we exercise many of the controls which are necessary in this area through our normal customs provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary reason why this legislation, this legislative approach, is necessary is that customs regulations are not able to deal with all the possibilities that exist. Our customs regulations and arrangements, for example, cannot  identify  and  regulate  all  items  that may be used in weapons of mass destruction programs. Some of those materials, some of that technology, can have commercial applications as well. So it becomes the responsibility of governments and their agencies to look at these materials and technologies to see where they are going and the purposes for which they may be applied. The customs regulations cannot be used to control the supply of goods and technology by Australians overseas. Our customs regulations relate to people who are resident in Australia. They cannot be used or extended to controlled services because services clearly are not included in customs arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this legislation is a safety net arrangement, a safety net provision, within legislation to support other arrangements. We have to understand that it is supplementary legislation; it is not primary legislation. In the time available to me, I would emphasise this: even though Australia, as I said, has a commendable record in relation to questions of this kind, the fulsome support of the Australian community for measures of these kinds should never make us feel smug or complacent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I would draw attention to the reason that was given by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) for this legislation. He said in part, towards the end of his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>weapons of mass destruction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">programs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fortunately the companies involved were cooperative and ceased the activities in question when the government informed them of its concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>Very commendable indeed. But what disturbs me is what he then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot, however, conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly in the face of the possible financial inducements on offer from those associated with the WMD programs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>How appalling that an Australian government minister finds it necessary to make such a comment as that&mdash;that it is suggested these precautions are necessary to ensure that possible financial inducements do not encourage people involved in business in Australia to make available materials, technology and services which can be used by others, and to access those suppliers knowingly used by others, for the purpose of mass destruction. It is for that reason this legislation is being introduced and considered by us&mdash;because, as horrifying as it may appear, we believe that in Australia there are people who and business interests which can be financially induced to participate in the industry and trade of international weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of countries like Australia addressing questions of this kind can be indicated by the experiences we have had in the past&mdash;in particular, I suppose, during this current century. It has been during this current century that nuclear weapons certainly have become available; that biological weapons have been developed; that chemical weapons have been developed, enhanced, made more sophisticated and more capable of carrying out the mass destruction for which they were designed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In World War I, for example, gas and chemicals found widespread application. By the war's end, gas casualties totalled nearly 1.3 million men, with more than 91,000 fatalities. I emphasise that, when we refer to gas and chemicals, they are included in what we call weapons of mass destruction. I also emphasise the figure I have just referred to because I will take the opportunity to refer to other examples which help to throw some light on the significance of that. So I repeat: there were 91,000 fatalities during World War I as a result of what we identify as weapons of mass destruction&mdash;gas and chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Second World War in place of chemical warfare, which was to a very large extent avoided, we had the deliberate destruction of the environment&mdash;the productive environment, the social environment&mdash;and, in particular, the massive destruction of the human environment. For example, during the Vietnam war, we also had what was known as the ranch hand program which saw the spraying of massive amounts of defoliant. That war also saw the widespread use of jellied gasoline, known as napalm. We might ask ourselves whether those activities which took place in Vietnam were carried out by barbarians&mdash;an appropriate question, a relevant question. Were they carried out by barbaric nations? No, they were not; they were carried out by countries, such as Australia and the United States, which had been identified as being among the civilised countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned those 91,000 fatalities from gas and chemical warfare in World War I. In Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, the explosion of an atomic bomb killed 70,000 people. The atomic bomb is identified as a weapon of mass destruction. In Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, three days later, the atom bomb killed 35,000 people. It is identified as a weapon of mass destruction. It is one of those weapons which we are attempting to deal with in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put it into context. People who are old enough to remember the Second World War will well recall the saturation bombing which took place in Tokyo on 9 and 10 March 1944. As a result of that saturation bombing with conventional weapons&mdash;they were not weapons of mass destruction&mdash;more than 100,000 people were killed in Tokyo. At Dresden on the nights of 13 and 14 February 1945, saturation bombing&mdash;again with conventional weapons&mdash;killed in excess of 100,000 people. Those figures on the fatalities associated with conventional weapons can be compared with the figures on deaths associated with weapons of mass destruction, which this legislation is designed to deal with as far as Australia is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In World War II, the United States used a total of seven million tons of munitions. We can compare that figure with what it used in the Vietnam War. From 1964 to 1972, the United States used 15 million tons of munitions in Vietnam. Eighty per cent of the casualties that occurred in Vietnam from aerial bombardments were civilians. With this legislation, we are also attempting to address questions of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention one other thing in order to put these figures into context and provide some sort of comparison. When we talk about weapons of mass destruction, we talk about nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, but there are other weapons of mass destruction throughout the world at the present time. They include poverty, starvation and disease, and I refer to them simply by way of comparison and to put those other weapons&mdash;the nuclear, biological and chemical weapons&mdash;into context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that we should not feel smug and complacent because Australia enacts legislation of this kind which is designed to ensure that we do not participate in international trade of weapons of mass destruction. The fact is that other factors can also be responsible for the destruction of people on a massive scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one horrifying figure shows that, around the world, 35,000 children die every day from preventable malnutrition and disease. We were horrified by Nagasaki, where 35,000 people died in one day. Around the world, 35,000 kids die every day as a result of&mdash;let me emphasise it&mdash;preventable malnutrition and disease. That is one kid every three seconds. During the time that I speak here, somewhere in the world about 1,200 kids will die as a result of&mdash;let me emphasise it again&mdash;preventable malnutrition and disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations has established a figure of 0.7 per cent of GDP as a target for the countries of the world to contribute towards the Third World&mdash;those countries and those people which in particular suffer the poverty, the starvation and disease which gives rise to such horrifying results. I think there are only about three countries of the world which meet that target. Australia is not one of them. I think we allocate about 0.33 per cent of our GDP to overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, sometimes we feel a bit smug and complacent about assisting the Third World, trying to prevent those kids from dying as a result of poverty, disease and starvation&mdash;preventable things. We say, `We are making our contribution,' and the developed world says that it is making its contribution, with some element of smugness and complacency. We say, `We toss in. We help. We are doing what we can.' I think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, one of the horrifying truths of this is that to a very large extent the assistance which is being made available by the First World&mdash;the affluent world, the well-off world&mdash;to the Third World at the end of the day represents a net transfer of wealth not from the wealthy countries of the world to the poorest but the other way. The whole mechanism now is such that there is a net transfer of wealth every year not from the rich to the poor but from the poor to the rich. I give one example. The International Monetary Fund has received some $2 billion more in repayments from Africa, some $2,000 million more, than it has provided in new loans to that continent since the 1980s. That is true right across the board. It is for reasons of that kind that I emphasise we should not be complacent about what we are doing. We should always seek to improve it. We should always seek to extend it. We have to be aware of the significance of some of these elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to be able to acknowledge that, at the people's summit held in Copenhagen earlier this year, this parliament was represented&mdash;John Langmore was there. I am delighted that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was also there. The Prime Minister addressed the conference.

<PARA>A decade ago, most workers had no access to superannuation, and Australia lacked a strategy to address the major challenges posed by an ageing population. Today, the government's superannuation strategy means that around 90 per cent of all employees have superannuation. Many of them have superannuation for the first time, as a result of the superannuation guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, together with the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill 1995, gives effect to the statement on superannuation policy made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 28 June 1994. The Treasurer's statement confirms the government's vision for superannuation. It strengthens the existing superannuation system, to ensure that it works more equitably for everyone&mdash;particularly people with small superannuation accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small superannuation accounts are inevitable. After all, most new employees begin with a small entitlement to contributions. This is particularly the case for casual, itinerant and part time workers, such as hospitality staff and fruit-pickers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with small accounts is that the fees and charges imposed on them can be more than the investment income earned. Clearly, this contributes nothing to retirement savings and is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is implementing a range of measures to deal with this problem:</PARA>
<PARA>.`member protection' of small superannuation accounts;</PARA>
<PARA>. measures to reduce the number of multiple accounts;</PARA>
<PARA>. the superannuation holding accounts reserve established by this bill; and</PARA>
<PARA>. other initiatives, including measures contained in the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taken together, these measures will ensure that compulsory superannuation contributions add greatly to national savings in the years to come, and will help to ensure higher retirement incomes for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to the provisions relating to member protection. Superannuation funds will be asked to `member protect' accounts by taking steps to prevent fees and charges from totalling more than investment income. Member protection will apply to any superannuation accounts under $1,000 which have received superannuation guarantee or award to superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been promoting member protection as its preferred approach to dealing with the small balances problem. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the Australian Taxation Office have written to all funds, financial advisers, trustees and employers, to explain the new rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of the member protection rules were contained in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations gazetted on 5 April 1995. These measures supplement existing regulations relating to the vesting of member benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of reducing multiple superannuation accounts, the government encourages people to transfer all their superannuation into one account. This will result in larger balances, which are less likely to be lost or eroded by fees. It will also mean that funds have will fewer small balances to member protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we asked the superannuation industry to establish a low cost transfer protocol for transferring benefits between funds. This should make it easier for people to transfer all of their superannuation to the fund used by their current employer. The transfer protocol will reduce costs throughout the industry, particularly for the major fund administrators, which cater to over 3.5 million industry fund members. The government intends to facilitate a transfer protocol by reducing the reporting requirements when benefits are transferred between funds. A high priority will be given to completing the necessary amendments to the income tax regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would prefer to see funds and administrators voluntarily cooperating to ensure that the transfer protocol spreads throughout the industry. I understand that the major fund administrators are working on a transfer protocol which they plan to make available to the industry more broadly. This is a welcome development, which I will be monitoring closely. However, the government will consider the feasibility of making the transfer protocol mandatory if that proves necessary in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the tax office collection mechanism, this bill establishes an alternative collection mechanism known as the superannuation holding accounts reserve, SHAR, administered by the Australian Tax Office. SHAR should reduce the number of small superannuation accounts and the overall cost of administering small accounts. The government is encouraging employers to use SHAR as a last resort, only where they are unable to contribute to a fund which provides member protection for small balances. Employers will be able to pay both compulsory and voluntary superannuation contributions into SHAR. There is no limit on the amount that can be paid in. However, income tax deductions for employer contributions will be limited to $1,200 per employee per annum. In addition, employers should not use SHAR where they have award or other obligations to contribute to a particular fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each individual will have their own account which will amalgamate all the accounts paid by different employers. The ATO will write to people when an account has been opened for them, explaining how SHAR will work. This information forms part of the government's ongoing commitment to public education about the benefits of superannuation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 June 1994 the Treasurer (Mr Willis) released details of the government's plan to counter the erosion of small accounts by fees and charges. As has been noted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), the plan had three main elements&mdash;an Australian Taxation Office collection scheme, member protection and a transfer protocol. The legislation before the House today establishes the reserve known as the superannuation holdings accounts reserve, which will be necessary to facilitate the collection of small accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition strongly supports the view that action must be taken to protect the hundreds of thousands of Australian workers who are within the superannuation net, but whose protection has simply not been there over recent years, we do not believe that the use of the Australian Tax Office as the sole mechanism for this level of protection is in the interests of contributors, nor is it in the interests of the government. As the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, this proposal will cost money. It will cost taxpayers, directly or indirectly, between $5 million and $7 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that we do not know. We really do not know what it is going to cost, for one very important reason: nobody is able to tell us with any degree of accuracy how many people will be entering into this proposed scheme, because we do not know how many people will be picked up by schemes in which they are already members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, we have been asked to buy a pig in a poke, but that is not unusual. We have seen that in the budget last night; we have seen it in recent budgets over the years. We have seen it so often in superannuation, where over 2,000 major changes have been introduced into superannuation legislation by a government which time and time again has demonstrated that: it rarely knows precisely where it is trying to go and spends most of its time with the leaking hull of superannuation, trying to stick a cork in every time it finds a new hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of all of this is quite simple. The vast majority of Australian workers have lost confidence in superannuation, because they do not know where the policy is leading them. They have seen to their cost, over the last year or so, that the asset bases of their funds have fallen&mdash;fallen to the situation where many have lost up to 20 per cent of the capital value of their funds. Yet those workers have been told by the government that they must invest in these schemes to ensure that they have an adequate retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is somewhat different. As we heard from the Treasurer last night, what the government is really on about is saying to the workers of Australia that in 20 years time there will be no guarantee that future governments, or the economy, or the taxpayers, will be prepared to maintain them with government pensions at the level to which they have grown accustomed. In other words, they are saying to the 75 to 80 per cent of the Australian population who are currently receiving either government pensions or part pensions that this circumstance may well change in the future. What they are really saying to those people is that the outcome of government policy, especially economic policy over the last 12 years, has left this country in such a shambles that in the future we will no longer be able to guarantee that the safety net which we have all taken for granted, which we have all believed to be a fundamental requirement of a social system which we support, will be there to help those who are most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the saddest part of all about the whole SGC arrangement is simply this: there are hundreds of thousands of Australian workers and their families who are being denied access to a component of their wages&mdash;in other words, their real wages have fallen&mdash;in the mistaken belief that they are going to be on an income level high enough to keep them out of the welfare system. Therefore they will not qualify for either full or part pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is very different. This small payments legislation is meant to be there to protect the interests of workers in temporary employment, in part-time employment, in the rural sector, in the factories and, above all, women. Women make up a disproportionate share of the total population engaged in those categories of employment. It is also meant to help people who have incomes between $5,400 and $20,000, and who are generally regarded as a low income component of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small accounts problem is not new. It has been there ever since the SG arrangements were introduced. It has been there ever since industrial awards required that all people under an award would have their money contributed to superannuation funds designated in the award. These contributions are often eroded by fees and charges, and the level of fees charged varies depending on the type of account and the institution offering the account. They may range from as little as 50c a week, for the funds charging the lowest fees, to a typical fee of approximately $1 a week, for industry funds, and an average of $1.56 per week for larger funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problem has been exacerbated by the fact that when funds' investment returns are low, as they have been in recent times, or in fact negative in virtually all funds, the additional contributions which have been put in on an annual basis by the workers have been significantly eroded by costs and charges over which they have absolutely no control. That has been the impact. Is it any wonder that thousands upon thousands of Australians are saying, `This is nothing more than a hidden tax. The money is taken from us, it is invested in a fund over which we have no control, and we get our final annual report which tells us that we have gone backwards?' They say, with good reason, `What sort of a savings system is that, that I put money in because by law I am required to do so and, at the end of the day, I have nothing to show for it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SG system works best for employees with one full-time job who receive regular employment contributions over a long period of time and those contributions are to a single fund. But unfortunately, for too long, the government allowed a situation to be perpetrated where, if you worked in two or three different industries, you would have a number of funds. The truth is there are thousands upon thousands of accounts out there today which are no longer active because the person has passed on to a different job in a different industry. Those funds are dying, because every month fees are being charged on that capital sum which is falling as a result. In other words, these people for so long have been making contributions to a government scheme under what can only be called false pretences, because they are losing what they are putting in. What is so sad is that many of these people are low-income people who cannot afford the luxury of handing over three per cent, and now six per cent, of their wages in that way and who, under the current government policy introduced last night, are going to be required to put in a further three per cent to bring it up to nine per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the member protection rules contained in this legislation, amounts of less than $1,000 in superannuation funds by 1 July this year will be put under the control of the tax office. Funds that decide not to operate the rules will not be able to accept small superannuation contributions from new members and will be required to transfer existing balances below $1,000 to a fund which will ostensibly protect employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has claimed that the scheme is meant to be self-financing. What that is meant to mean is that the contributions which will attract an interest rate based on government bonds will then be used to fund the costs of the scheme. If, by some luck, there is an excess of interest over costs, the contributors may be lucky to get a small dividend. But at the least the government is being honest on this point: the level of return will clearly be below what would be anticipated under normal circumstances in a superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have gone further to say that this whole scheme will be regarded as a low-cost vehicle for the collection of small contributions and its administration will be assisted by the use of the tax file number. Nevertheless, the fundamental fact of the matter is that every superannuant in this country, through their funds, may well be expected to subsidise the costs of this scheme in the event that the costs exceed the dividend from the investment of those funds. In other words, we do not know what the cost is going to be, for the reason I mentioned initially: we do not know how many workers will be covered by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO will be authorised to collect superannuation payments on behalf of people in respect of whom contributions are less than $1,200 for each term of employment. The funds held by the ATO will be amalgamated so that each superannuant will have only one account. That is certainly a step forward, which we support. The earnings of the fund will be linked to the interest on Commonwealth securities. The ATO will deduct administrative costs before distributing earnings, as I have already discussed. Interest will be paid only on a maximum of $1,200 per account. So, even if people want to leave their funds in there longer, that $1,200 will be an absolute amount. Anything in addition to that will get no interest at all, and yet those people may well wish not to put their funds in a normal mainline superannuation scheme, for whatever reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this issue the opposition's position is fundamentally different from that of the government. We believe in freedom of choice. We believe in greater competition. We believe in greater protection for contributors. On all those three points the gap between us and the government in this area of policy is absolute. Since 1988 I have, on behalf of the opposition, asked for the introduction of retirement savings accounts as a simple mechanism to solve the needs of these people which have been so evident for so long and on which the government has done so little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not new. All the countries of the OECD&mdash;Canada, the United States, Great Britain and many others&mdash;have products such as retirement savings accounts, which have the greatest benefit of all. You empower individuals, especially people with low incomes, who have, as I said, four or five different jobs within a month or within two months and who until now have been losing their shirts because of the application of the SGC regulations. A system of retirement savings accounts works just like a bankbook. When people are employed they go to their employer, who is required to make a contribution, the contribution is entered into the book and it goes through the banking system and ultimately goes into their account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is their money, it does not belong to anybody else. It is not in some fund which may or may not one day give them a dividend. They can keep the book under their pillow if they want to. They can take it out every morning, look at it and see a dollar number, and they will know what is in there. It is reliable. It is honest. It is exactly what they want. They will get an interest rate on that money and it will not cost the government a cent. But it empowers those people. They are not big people, they are not powerful people. They are the one million to 1 1/2 million ordinary Australians who do not earn a lot of money, who may never earn a lot of money but have the right to believe that they can save their money the way they want to to achieve the objective, which is a reasonably laudatory one of the government, to enable them to have greater financial independence in their retirement. On that point we are in total agreement, but we do not believe that this is the way to do it when there is a perfectly sane, sensible and achievable alternative proposal to work through the private sector which individual Australians can control themselves, without having to worry about what the tax office or anybody else thinks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not seem to understand the fact that we do not want the ACTU to control Australia's industrial relations as well as our retirement income strategy. Australians do not want the government to control the means of their long-term financial independence. Australians want a government that establishes an economic and a social regime which enables them to have greater freedom of choice in the methods and the manner by which they make those savings. They do want to save for their retirement. Most Australians do accept the fact that, in the long term, it may be difficult for Australians, their children and their children's children, to fund their retirement indefinitely, at current levels. There is the view that, if you have the capacity to save, you should do so, because Australia's domestic savings ratios are appalling on international comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, something must be done about it. But it cannot be done in a way which prescribes and determines, and forces people into a system which&mdash;to use the words of the parliamentary secretary and his Treasury officials, who made the point before he did&mdash;may not be long lasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, it is no wonder that the opposition will be moving amendments to this legislation, based on two fundamental principles. Firstly, we believe that this act should have a life of only two years. We want to put a sunset clause in it, so that, in two years time, it will no longer be necessary for the ATO to run the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, we want to see the Commissioner of Taxation and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission enter into negotiations with the private sector, with the finance industry as a whole, with the banks, with the building societies, with the credit unions, with the life offices and with all the financial intermediaries, to establish a regime under which we can have greater competition and greater choice in the financial industry in relation to retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many people have lost much money over the last two years. One of the reasons that is so is that there is not enough freedom of choice and there is not enough competition in the system. I do not need to go any further than the evidence, which was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last week, of the enormous increase in private superannuation schemes in this country over recent times. That is because people are walking away from the system. They believe that, if their money has to go into a scheme which loses it, they may as well have a crack at managing it themselves, because they could not do any worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing is that the record is absolutely clear: if individuals who know little or nothing about financial management try to organise their affairs for the long term, in an industry and a market situation wherein there is nowhere near perfect access to information, the high probabilities are that they will lose their money and they will, ultimately, become full age pensioners, in the very years of their lives when they hoped to enjoy the independence they were saving for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is outrageous. That walking away from the system on the part of so many people demonstrates clearly that Australians are losing confidence in the national superannuation system because it involves too many changes which they do not understand. There are very few people in this country who can honestly tell you from week to week, if not from day to day, what is going to be in the superannuation regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one is asking people to make determinations on their long-term financial viability, the first and most fundamental need must always be confidence: confidence in the system, and confidence that the proposals being put forward by government will stand and will not change day by day or week by week. When one asks people to make that final investment which, once gone, is gone for good with no prospect of return, they need to be confident that they are doing so in an environment wherein they have greater freedom of choice and greater opportunity to determine what they believe to be in their interests. They need to have the capacity to retire with confidence, knowing that they will maintain that degree of independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary, the Treasurer last night, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on numerous occasions, have told the Australian people why they must save for their retirement. They say it is in the people's interests and it is in Australia's interests. But it is in nobody's interests, if they cannot carry with it the fundamental underpinning of national confidence. They must have a system in place which people will trust, so that they will make investments accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go further in this area. There is clearly a view in the government that superannuation should be seen as the preferred means of investment, and the government has been prepared to invest, in terms of forgone tax, no less than $5.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, ACOSS has recently made the point in its budget statement that that is not, by itself, good enough. There need to be intermediate savings mechanisms for those hundreds of thousands of Australians who also have to save for the crises of life&mdash;not just for the crises of old age, not just for the crises of retirement, but for the crises of life. Nothing has been done. Nothing has been said. Nothing has been achieved. Nothing will be done by this government in those critical areas of policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the House, I quote what ACOSS said about the superannuation changes announced last night. Those changes are very relevant to the legislation before us today. ACOSS said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACOSS has grave reservations about the impact of this budget's superannuation measures on low income people. We recognise the government's attempt to soften and sweeten the compulsory employee contribution by way of phase-in and matching contributions. While these measures will cushion the impact on low income earners, they do not solve the problem that low income people will be required to forego much needed wage increases. Part or all of these wage increases will now be diverted into superannuation. The contributory scheme does not compensate for this loss. Moreover, it is not clear that the scheme will be properly financed, so there may be another sting in the tail further down the line for low income people.</PARA>
<PARA>I say amen to that. I regard the changes announced last night to be similar to the activities before the last budget when the government came forward with its taxation changes under the so-called One Nation statement. We know what happened to them. Despite the various commitments made at the time, they died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the legislation, which will no doubt be introduced in due course in relation to these superannuation changes, will effectively be saying to people, `Nothing will change before 1998-99, on the brink of the new century.' The Australian Labor Party may well not be in government then. I believe it will not. That demonstrates how, when government comes forward with proposals such as this, unless it is able to do something within the confines of a normal three-year term of government, it is doing nothing more than offering a pie in the sky change, which will alter rapidly with changing economic and social developments, as we are well aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed in terms of the One Nation strategy. It has backed off on the taxation changes. It is now trying to link in some taxation changes in relation to superannuation. The government is offering people $1,000 compensation for superannuation, which by the year 2000 will represent a nine per cent contribution by employers, a three per cent contribution by employees, and a three per cent contribution by the government. The truth of the matter is that the government cannot guarantee that it will be delivered. The commitments the government has made to take effect from 1996 have not been guaranteed to any degree. Therefore, people have no reason to presume that the government is going to do anything, especially as it has not fulfilled its commitments on other occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the specifics of this legislation. The scheme announced by the Treasurer has the general support of the superannuation industry lobby, including the Life Insurance Federation of Australia and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. We know it has the support of the trade unions and some consumer groups, such as the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I should hasten to add that in all of these cases, with the possible exception of the ACTU, one thing holds them together. These groups know that the problems with small contributors to superannuation is an ethical and equity problem of significance in this country. It is grotesque that for so long the government has allowed these people to make contributions to schemes in which they have lost their money. In many cases, as they transfer from one job to another or transfer from one industry to another, they are forced by government regulations and laws to take out new schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this so? It is because, since 1994, the government has totally failed to address the problem of effective portability and preservation. It could have done so. The opposition did so in its policy in 1988. The industry did not like it. The industry people said, `It is very difficult to do these sorts of things.' My response was, `You have computers. You make it work. You have no right to take money from people time and time again under different accounts and charge them fees, when often those accounts have a very short life span and, consequently, year by year, they have less and less and less, until finally those accounts disappear altogether.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard of a case last week. A gentleman phoned me to say that he was in one of those schemes and that after all the money had been dissipated on costs and charges, would you believe it, he got a bill for $44. He is now paying into a scheme which no longer has a fundamental capital base for him and which is asking him to pay more money. It is outrageous that the situation has been allowed to be perpetuated since 1994 with the full knowledge of the government. Until now the government has done nothing about it. But now, because the ACTU sees a problem, it has decided finally to take some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have said throughout this debate, action must be taken. It should have been taken years ago. We are not going to oppose the action that has been taken, because something is better than nothing in a situation like this. However, we are saddened and we are appalled that since 1988 this government has refused, despite all the evidence of international precedents, to introduce a flexible approach to this fundamental problem. That approach has to be based on giving people greater freedom of choice, of giving people greater competition within the superannuation industry and, above all, giving contributors the confidence to believe that the contributions they make are safe and secure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to make the point that, whereas money that goes into a bank is for all intents and purposes guaranteed by the government through the Reserve Bank and through the Banking Act, there is no provision by which the government guarantees money in superannuation schemes. Government members just shrug their shoulders when we have a crisis like we had last year, when virtually every scheme in this country ran at a loss or was lucky to break even. People rose up against this. Anybody involved in superannuation knows that hundreds and hundreds of people have come to us and have said that their so-called capital funds which are meant to be secure have turned out to be anything but secure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be said that the nomenclature is wrong. That is an easy excuse. The truth of the matter is that the government has done nothing to defend the interests of these people who have done all the right things throughout their lives, have tried to maintain the dignity of financial independence in their retirement, and at the very time when they are no longer capable of making further contributions have had the rug pulled from under their feet and have lost their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal which was introduced last night sounds grand when you consider the implications for somebody going into the work force in their 20s and with the expectation of a 40-year cycle of constant contributions. We were told by the Treasurer this morning, and by the Prime Minister on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, that these people will be retiring with $250,000 or more. It sounds great that in terms of AWOTE that person will be getting at least double the level of average weekly earnings. It sounds fantastic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, may I just put this simple proposition. The vast majority of people in this country are not in their 20s. The biggest problem facing older Australians and middle-aged Australians is whether they will have sufficient funds for their retirement. The truth is, on the basis of the existing government program, that the current level of contributions, even if it gets to nine per cent, will mean that the vast majority of those people will not be taken fully out of the pension scheme. They will qualify for part pensions because the levels which are being applied are not sufficient to achieve a level of financial independence, and the number of years in which those people will contribute will be far too short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the policy announced in the budget last night which does anything for people in their 50s. There is absolutely nothing. There is very little in it for people in their 40s but, as I said, it might sound grand for people in their 20s. It misses the point that people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, throughout that period of their lives, have periods where financial crises are real. These include purchasing their first home, educating themselves or their children, and providing financial independence when they are unemployed. These are real crises which have been ignored in the government's approach to national savings and to retirement savings in particular. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Small Superannuation Accounts Bill 1995 and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill are the culmination of many years of calamitous, ineffective hyperactivity by Labor in the area of superannuation. Superannuation policy should revolve around the best methods of providing all working Australians with a commonsense superannuation policy to best meet their needs in retirement. A genuine retirement income strategy demands a stable and predictable political environment, security, incentives to encourage financial independence, better integration of the tax and social security systems and the guarantee of a government safety net.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet what we have seen over the past few years is a superannuation system being developed which fails to meet these basic criteria. Our superannuation laws will not meet the needs of workers in their retirement. We have a dysfunctional system which has been the subject of so many alterations that no right-minded person can plan for his or her retirement with any certainty. Retirement and superannuation policies are confusing, complex, contradictory, uncertain, illogical and unfair. The challenge is clear enough: keep superannuation policy as simple as possible.

A dramatic change of mind-set by both the community and the government is required.

An example I outlined in the House last November was of one of my constituents who earned something like $386 interest on a not insubstantial balance, but incurred taxes and fees of $407. His fund went backwards! And that is not an isolated story; it is pretty well the rule for the past year or so. Where is the incentive in those figures to contribute to your own retirement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the ludicrous position where superannuation is being used as a political tool to reward the union movement for its support for the Labor Party. We have a superannuation system which is so ramshackle, distorted and convoluted that any attempt to make superannuation policy satisfy the needs of workers planning for retirement will only set unions against life offices, life offices against banks, and industry funds against public offer funds. So far, only vested interests have been served by Labor's mismanagement of superannuation and its litany of changes since year one. The biggest losers to date have been those workers who changed jobs and industries on a regular basis. These bills comprise merely the government's latest attempt to rectify the problem with small accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 June 1994, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) released details of the government's plans to counter the erosion of small accounts by fees and charges. The plan has three main elements: an Australian Taxation Office collection scheme, member protection, and a transfer protocol. It is intended to establish a reserve, known as the superannuation holding accounts reserve, to facilitate the collection of small accounts. The provisions will become operative on 1 July of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the cost of establishing this reserve will be approximately $5.6 million. The annual cost of administering the reserve is estimated at between $7 million and $7 1/2 million. The Australian Bankers Association believes the cost of running the scheme will be significantly greater than the amount suggested by the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office expects that these annual running costs will be offset by earnings on the funds held in reserve. One problem with the small accounts is that both the superannuation guarantee arrangements and industrial awards may require small contributions to be made into superannuation funds. This problem has been exacerbated by the fact that few employers can offer workers the option of choosing the fund into which their money will be paid. Many employers are required under union awards to place superannuation guarantee and award superannuation contributions into a union sponsored industry fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue which is certain to be the focus of increased attention in the near future. When employees are required to contribute to their superannuation&mdash;as the budget papers indicate they will be not too many years hence&mdash;the issue of which fund their money goes into will gain added importance. Those employees who contribute towards the cost of their retirement will increasingly come to realise the cost involved and gain an appreciation of the ownership of their future retirement income. It will not be a great surprise to anyone if employees then begin to demand the superannuation scheme or fund of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small contributions are often eroded by fees and charges, as I have already demonstrated. The levels of fees and charges vary, depending on the type of account and the institution operating the account. The fees range from around 50c per week for the funds charging the lowest fees, to a typical $1 per week for industry funds, and an average $1.56 per week for the large funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems are exacerbated when funds' investment returns are low or negative, as has recently been the case. The superannuation guarantee system works best for employees with one full-time job who receive regular employer contributions over a long period, paid into a single fund. However, employees who regularly change jobs, work intermittently, or engage in short-term work, often end up with a number of accounts, all with small balances, each incurring fees and charges. Substantial fund exit and entry charges on top of that make it difficult and prohibitively costly to combine these accounts into one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member protection rules that protect amounts of less than $1,000 in superannuation funds will be in place by 1 July 1995. Funds that decide not to operate by the rules will not be able to accept small superannuation amounts from new members and will be required to transfer existing balances below $1,000 to a fund which will protect employees' retirement savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where employers are unable to find a suitable fund, those employers will be able to make contributions into the superannuation holding accounts reserve. Because the reserve will not be a superannuation fund, it will not be subject to the same costly prudential standards as are the superannuation funds. No administration charges will be applied to the employees' account and the moneys will remain untaxed while in the account. Of course, that changes when an account reaches the minimum and goes into a normal fund. The scheme aims to provide a low cost vehicle for the collection of small contributions, and its administration will be assisted by the use of tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills are just another attempt by Labor which is bound to fail to introduce real reform and to meet the stated aims of the government. The government cannot and will not embrace meaningful reform because it will disturb too many vested interests to which it is beholden. The most important of these is, of course, the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small accounts scheme as outlined in these bills has the general support of the superannuation industry bodies such as the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the trade union movement in so far as it is represented by the ACTU, and the consumer group, the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Australian Taxation Office mechanism will be only of limited benefit and of short-term merit. Treasury has admitted that the ATO mechanism may stop account balances from going backwards but it will not generate growth after the deduction of costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has also indicated that, as a result of the new member protection rules, many funds will have to introduce some form of cross-subsidisation to smooth charges across all members' accounts. The superannuation supervision regulations in their current form will not allow this as they require the costs of funds to be distributed in a fair and reasonable manner. The government has indicated&mdash;early in April, I think&mdash;that amendments will have to be made to give trustees power to cross-subsidise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of major defects in this legislation. The first is that the government refuses to provide real freedom of choice for workers planning for their retirement. To assist in developing a wider level of choice, the coalition has long advocated the retirement savings accounts, the RSAs, as an important part of the coalition's retirement income policy and we have advocated that since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RSAs are supported by the Australian Bankers Association and the credit union movement. They would provide a superannuation type product designed to cater for the needs of casual, part-time, temporary and itinerant workers and as an alternative rollover facility. These accounts could also maintain, if it is required, the ATO as the collector of government revenue, leaving it free from the management of superannuation accounts. By using the tax file number, contributions can be received from various employers while their portability makes RSAs ideal for people with irregular employment, especially women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that it is women who are disproportionately penalised by the absence of RSAs. Women are more inclined to work part time and in lower paid positions for many reasons including the need to provide care for their children. Importantly, RSAs can also provide for capital growth, unlike the ATO proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy provides that they could be offered by banks, building societies, credit unions, life offices or the superannuation funds themselves. The RSAs would add an additional and very important element to competition and provide greater choice in a superannuation system which currently lacks both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, RSAs were endorsed by Dr FitzGerald in his report, which was commissioned by the present government, on national savings. The FitzGerald report advocated several necessary changes to government policy on superannuation that would assist in increasing the rate of savings. FitzGerald recommended, amongst other things, superannuation savings accounts and increased competition between the current players and, of course, future participants. Ensuing increased competition and freedom of choice would keep costs down and ensure that the system operates effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, there are disagreements between the banks and life offices over the provision of RSAs. The former see it as a convenient mechanism for increasing their market share of superannuation products, while the latter feel that, unless the banks are subject to the same prudential standards&mdash;such as trusteeship arrangements&mdash;as the superannuation funds, they will not be competing on the proverbial level playing field. The coalition will allow financial institutions which meet the same prudential standards as the superannuation funds to directly provide superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another serious deficiency with this legislation is the use of the ATO leviathan to collect and administer small superannuation amounts. The primary function of the Australian Taxation Office is surely to collect taxation revenue. It is not a freelance collection agency. We should remember that it has extraordinary powers&mdash;powers which it is not shy in using. These exist to protect the revenue base. The Taxation Office should not be in the business of superannuation administration and funds management, such as it is with the Child Support Agency. This takes it right outside its mandate, which is to collect the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who believe the tax office should play a role in collecting superannuation from employees, and who truly have the interests of casual, part-time, itinerant and low income workers at heart, should take time to read the Auditor-General's report No. 39, an efficiency audit into the management of the Child Support Agency within the Australian Taxation Office. As many in this place are probably aware, I hold reports of the Auditor-General in the highest regard. I put great emphasis on his findings and recommendations. The Auditor-General found that there were several serious deficiencies in the management and administration of the scheme, a major consequence of which was an unsatisfactory standard of service to clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saga of the Child Support Agency is an unfortunate example of what happens when the tax office becomes involved in activities which are peripheral to its primary function. The tax office collects higher education charges, child support payments and now superannuation payments&mdash;in addition to taxes. The spread of its influence and the use of tax file numbers is as pervasive as anything envisaged by the Australia card. The encroachment of the tax office into policy and administrative areas, which do not relate to the function of revenue collection, is a development which should not just be stopped, but reversed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, superannuation policy under Labor has been a litany of wasted opportunity. These bills are no exception. They do little to improve the operation of the superannuation system. The very rapidity of legislative changes to superannuation policy has created uncertainty where stability should be paramount. Superannuation is not as widely accepted as it should be as the preferred vehicle for retirement saving. The use of the ATO in fixing the small accounts problem will not work. It only attacks the symptoms without providing a cure. Management fees, taxes levied on monies going into and out of funds, the legislative uncertainty, and the lack of choice of superannuation schemes have all led many people to challenge the worth of superannuation as it is now constituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes the life of this scheme should be limited to two years, after which time RSAs should be introduced. We do not oppose the bill, because it does offer some respite for small account holders, even if it is aimed at the lowest common denominator. However, we put the government on notice that we will pursue amendments in the Senate. It is an indication of the government's general lack of interest in superannuation matters that there is no-one on the Labor side listed to speak in this debate. The whip might go out and dredge someone up, but there is no-one there at the moment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I drew to the parliament's attention the records provided to me by a couple of shearers who were in casual employment&mdash;one might say itinerant employment&mdash;involving numerous employers who were obliged to pay in this money, which created problems in the first instance. I told the parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people were interested to see how they were going. One individual in his first year of operation, the period from 15 March 1989 to 23 January 1990, received contributions from a variety of employers of $165.64. He now has an account balance of $34.58.</PARA>
<PARA>We heard the Prime Minister this morning trying to tell everyone that he is the only fount of wisdom in this place.

I drew attention to another example where a person had had paid in on his behalf $382.86 and then had an account balance of $191.35. It has been happening for all that time, and I quoted the example of the shearers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard that there is a problem that these banks and things like that somehow do not suffer the same prudential requirements as superannuation funds. What do you have the Reserve Bank for? Why do you go to so much trouble to force banks to keep funds with the Reserve Bank, on which you have just reduced the interest payments by five percentage points? As I understand it, the major banks are not allowed to go broke. They are better placed in prudential terms than any superannuation company would be today. That is the first problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just widen this discussion somewhat. This bill is about a matter that has been endemic in this government's compulsory superannuation arrangements for six or seven years and which should have been corrected much earlier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the House that this is not the only time I have entered this place to make remarks of this nature and to draw attention to my grave concern about this form of savings policy.

It is certainly one that the Prime Minister never bothers to pull out of his drawer as a discredited document. You might remember how that particular document came to be in existence.

In Sweden you could not get your teeth fixed if you had only money to pay for it, because the tax burden on the dentist was so high that he only took payment in kind. For instance, if the dentist's pipes were blocked up, the plumber could get his teeth attended to.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the favoured taxation treatment of investment through superannuation funds, a lever exists to redirect part of their investment portfolio to longer term growth and expansion objectives. This can be achieved by diverting some proportion of the future income of such funds into a National Development Fund managed through the Australian Industry Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the government is going to sell the last little bit of that corporation in this particular budget. What was all that about? It was about government telling superannuation funds how to invest the savings of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the track record of governments per se, it is fairly unlikely that they are a good choice of investment advice. I am reminded of Maggie Thatcher's remark to our party room years ago when she told us that it was imperative we got government out of business. She said, `After all, if we politicians were any good at business, we would be in business.' It was a pretty careful and sensible remark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A simple fact of life is that the last place I would want my retirement funds to be with would be some instrumentality receiving instructions from the ACTU and/or this government. Let me remind the House that, when it comes to investment, this government has racked up so much debt that it is now obliged to sell the family silver. Notwithstanding that, this budget tells us that public debt interest is over $10,000 million; that defence expenditure is under $10,000 million; and that public debt interest is almost equal to education outlays. What an outrage! You now want people to believe that you have worked a miracle and that you are going to create huge assets for them in their retirement by a new superannuation scheme, which is primarily brought forward to find an excuse for not giving them their promised l-a-w tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has it achieved? What does it propose? The Prime Minister was telling us this morning that for the first time in Australian journalistic history we have a new term&mdash;TR, for trillions. That is his achievement. He was getting pretty close in debt, let alone in savings. Of course the TR comes well down the track, long after he has gone to live in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the simple facts of life are that he is seeking to put all that money, by legal instruction, into one investment program. What is that investment program? Superannuation. Where does it invest? It is going to be urged by the ACTU and others to do all sorts of wonderful things and to invest in infrastructure, but it has not done it to any extent yet. It has invested in blue chip companies&mdash;not the struggling ones that might come up with the brilliant ideas that take Australia to the forefront of technology throughout the world. They do not touch them. They are too frightened. You might say that is right, but we are talking about expanding the Australian economy through savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They invest in the money markets, and they do a pretty good job of manipulating both. They can become very dangerous in the share markets by manipulating those markets with the trillions of dollars that the government proposes to deliver to them through superannuation legislation. With that sort of money they can jack up and rort share markets and money markets from time to time. That is unsatisfactory, but it gives them what they believe to be a satisfactory bottom line out in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give this parliament a simple example, as I have before. If you are big enough to hold hundreds of millions of BHP shares and if at the final board meeting before you declare your dividends or your bonuses for superannuation policies you decide your profits are insufficient, you can go out and, by creating market activity, jack up the price of BHP shares and revalue all the ones you already have and go back and tell people that you have a lot more money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it has got worse than that. The world is sick of inflation and is sick of high interest rates; and all those simple and safe devices available to the AMPs, the CMLs, et cetera, of old of just putting their money out&mdash;in fact, we obliged companies to put, I think, 30 per cent of their resources into government holdings in years gone by&mdash;have become so marginal that they barely meet their operating costs. So what did they do? They decided to take out a very sophisticated bookmaker's licence. They decided to operate in the more speculative world markets, many of which were created for the best possible reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The futures exchange is an example. As I explained to the parliament the other day, I as a wool grower might have gone and sold a future to guarantee me a price for my wool on such and such a day because I wanted to meet commitments to my bank. I was more happy to know I was going to get that much than to wait and get even a little more. At the same time, in the old days a wool processor somewhere in the world was happy to take up that future because he had a contract to provide blankets to the army or something like that at a fixed price and wanted to lock in the price of the raw material. They are proper and appropriate business transactions. </PARA>

They have been betting people that they have a better understanding of where the market is going than those people in the trade. They sat in the middle, and now we are creating almost artificial opportunities for them to gamble, as we did in this parliament the other day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the money is going to go. It is not going to do anyone any good and it is not going to resolve our balance of payments problem. It is all right to say that we have the savings here to pay for the consumer goods and everything we buy from anywhere else, but we want the investment here so the goods are made here and we do not have to buy them from anywhere else. That is what we want savings for. But, if you do not give a share of it to the banks which finance small business, all you will have are these so-called fund managers playing in speculative areas because the traditional areas do not return sufficient funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have a far too narrow investment policy, and they always have. To an extent, as a result of the government's prudential requirements, they have little choice to do anything else. The government is creating a monster. It is not creating savings where we want them. It is not creating circumstances where people want to save. The government is ignoring some of the other things that people need for a viable retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put the family home at the top of that. The government only has to look at its own books to see what we have to pay to pensioners who have been unable to buy a home during their working life&mdash;the extras we have to give them because they cannot live on the pension and pay rent. The first thing that is required is the ownership of a home. The Prime Minister has been waxing eloquent this morning about how much money persons who are 40 years away from their pension will get&mdash;$461,000, to be exact. What will that buy people in 40 years time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good question that the parliamentary secretary or someone might answer is: having been told that three per cent will be put in as a government contribution, will that be levied at 15 per cent as it walks through the front door of superannuation companies, as will be the employee's contribution and the employer's contribution? Is 15 per cent on three per cent a higher tax rate than what many low-paid workers would pay? It is, because they pay practically no tax at all. A family man's minimum income is not the $33,000 a year that the Prime Minister has been running around quoting this morning. I have people working for me who are lucky to earn $15,000 a year&mdash;the proper award wage. Fifteen thousand dollars to $20,000 is what the people who vote for you earn. But the Prime Minister is telling people how much money they will get if they earn $33,000 for 40 years. What a joke. A fellow who rang me a little while ago said, `I've had a look at this superannuation thing. I am getting on a bit but I reckon it is worth about $80,000 to me. By the time I get it, that will be the price of a Ford Falcon.' What will $461,000 be worth in 40 years time? These are the problems with the government's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has brought down is, in a general sense, a federal payroll tax called an employer contribution and an increased personal tax of three per cent on all workers&mdash;some of whom would not pay that much in tax in their normal circumstances&mdash;and the government is going to rake 15 per cent out of it as it goes through the front door of superannuation companies. But all of this hinges on one problem, and that is that the government is going to put probably trillions into a very narrow investment area and then ask our people to go out and play in sophisticated world markets against people like George Souris, who would eat them for breakfast with the resources he has behind him. Please remember that for every derivative market winner there is a derivative loser, as we learned the other day with Mr Leeson. He outlaid $20 million and took the chance of losing billions&mdash;and did. Those are the circumstances and that is where most of this money will go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I remind the House that on 10 April 1991 I drew the attention of this House to the fact that people with itinerant work and making small contributions were losing their money hand over fist. We are today, nearly four years later, attempting to address this in a very inadequate and foolish way when better operations are available. They are not being taken up because, firstly, they were proposed by the coalition&mdash;it is disastrously tragic that decisions are made on that principle&mdash;and, secondly, for reasons I cannot understand, the ACTU does not like them either&mdash;and of course once it does not like something that is the end of it with this government in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has known of this problem all that time; it has done nothing about it. If you take my two examples you will see that what people have lost from their potential retirement fund runs into the millions because the government has been too slow to act.

On 14 April 1993 his employer paid an amount of $43.38 into the Australian Farm Superannuation Fund for his benefit.

Now we hear absolutely nothing about young people having the ability to access the money that they have paid into superannuation funds. They now have no opportunity to access those funds to finance themselves into a home and to accommodate their family.

Any advantage that they might have had has been put off to 40 years down the track.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation is an important aspect of policy development, particularly in view of the large postwar baby boom generation moving towards the age pension age in the next couple of decades. There is no doubting the importance of superannuation; however, the complexity of the rules governing superannuation funds finds many employees worse off by having money put into funds that simply do not work for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation legislation seeks to prevent, albeit in a minor way, employees losing on superannuation by having fees eat away their contributions, often leaving fund holders with less money than has been contributed. This legislation sets up the superannuation holding accounts reserve which, for the purposes of Commonwealth law, is not a superannuation fund. The Australian Taxation Office will be authorised to collect superannuation payments for employees where the contribution for the employee, for their period of employment, is less than $1,200. It will allow people to have their own accounts and will bring together all the amounts paid by different employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the superannuation reserve is meant to be used only as a last resort in cases where employers cannot find a superannuation fund willing to accept small payments, given that member protection is to apply, which ensures superannuation funds accept only contributions to accounts with a balance of less than $1,000 on the premise they guarantee that the account will not be reduced because of administrative costs and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been contacted by many constituents who have had their fingers burned by superannuation funds taking out more in fees than has been earned, resulting in a negative return. I will quote one constituent who wrote to me about her son's superannuation fund earlier this year. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is a student, but gets occasional part time work. On the latest statement, you will note on September 30, 1994, he had a balance of $191.44. On October 18 1994, after a whopping account services fee of $49.89 and Superannuation taxes of $30.89, he now has $111.20.</PARA>
<PARA>For those mathematicians who think it should be $110.66, I can tell them that he earned 55c interest and paid 1c duty. His mother goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this rate, by the end of next year, should he get no more work from that employer, he will owe his superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent asked what could be done to assist people in situations such as that experienced by her son. I am sure that stories like that can be repeated many thousands of times around Australia. This legislation certainly is not a panacea which addresses this lady's problem, but it is also not unnecessary legislation. I will go on a little about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part-time employee I am aware of had under $500 in her fund and, on attaining full-time employment, asked for the money to be sent to her. The reply she received said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The calculation of your benefit . . . has resulted in a negative account balance, therefore, no benefit is due.</PARA>
<PARA>This reply came after she had contributed about $150 and, at the end of the day, she did not get a single cent back. One final example involves a gentleman who started a business and employed a casual employee. In a letter to me, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 October, it was necessary for me to make contributions for this lady, aged 58, under the Superannuation Guarantee Scheme. Between that date and 6 December, the total contributions to the AMP Superleader Scheme for casuals were $231.68. During that time, the account accrued $8 administration fees and $24.75 "contributions tax". While the former may be justifiable, the latter seems to be taxation by stealth&mdash;particularly as the individual has already been subject to PAYE taxation. Essentially, the total deductions from the contributions represent a 14.3 per cent loss of capital over little more than a two month period. There is no indication of this tax in either the Australian Taxation Office's materials about the Superannuation Guarantee or the AMP booklet, and hence I am confused about the real intention of the scheme for casual employees. What seems certain is that such individuals will not benefit to any great degree.</PARA>
<PARA>These examples obviously highlight the need for changes. This legislation will in some way address the problem. Even though it is not at all a panacea, it is at least a safety net, for want of a better word. I must say that I am disappointed that banks cannot play a similar role to the reserve. Banks could simply offer superannuation accounts&mdash;certainly for small amounts&mdash;that would be easy to understand and would not include the costly fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems ironic that I am supporting such a scheme. One of the superannuation funds I spoke of before&mdash;it ate away a person's small contribution with fees&mdash;was administered by a bank. However, the reserve being set up under this legislation should also be able to be performed along similar lines by banks. This will allow freedom of choice, and the competition would provide for better services and returns&mdash;or at least it should. In June 1992, the then Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To simplify the regulation and taxation of superannuation savings, the Government will consider the development of a generic superannuation savings account vehicle that could be offered by a wider range of financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation deals with employees, particularly part-time and casual employees, who have small contributions which are being eaten away by fees. It essentially is a last resort safety net, with superannuation funds in the first instance expected to protect members with small funds. Therefore, there is no reason why banks cannot also institute a similar account where small amounts are not eaten away by fees rather than have only the Australian Taxation Office do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that to do this banks would also need to be allowed to offer a type of superannuation savings account, which they are presently not able to do. The government needs to consider this if it is to be believed when it claims it is serious about encouraging saving and having people provide for their retirement. This system would be particularly advantageous for part-time, casual and temporary employees. I certainly hope the government gives this serious consideration, for it would provide greater flexibility for consumers, competition and freedom of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a small step in improving the superannuation system in truly providing a genuine system for Australians to provide for their retirement.

But let us deal with superannuation alone and find out what occurs with the government's impost of a broadbrush approach to a matter which has been the province of individuals.

It gave tax cuts in 1993 to the people at the lower end of the income range, and then it promised that the rest of the community&mdash;the middle income earners&mdash;would get cuts later. It was going to be in 1996, and then it was 1998. Who knows when it will be now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer said, `We will drop that and use the same money in a superannuation program.' Who will get the benefit of the superannuation program? It will be the lower income earners. I have no problems with that, but middle Australia is now saying, `We are getting nothing out of this government. We have had no tax concessions. We don't receive any superannuation benefits. How is this government being beneficial to us?' These are the average, small, self-employed people and those at the middle management level. I am not talking about wealthy people. I am talking about people with families and who are in the middle income range. The government has decided, in its wisdom, that those people have missed out on tax cuts&mdash;there are no apologies&mdash;and they will now miss out on the superannuation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the poorer people in Australia have got much poorer because of this federal government. They have suffered at the hands of this government. The very people that the bleeding hearts of the Australian Labor Party claim to stand for have been ground into the dust with punitive taxation policies, neglect and no work. That is what the government has finally done to the low income earners. The best prospect the government can offer them is not a pie in the sky when they die but, if they happen to live long enough, a pie in  the sky  in  the  form  of  some  sort  of superannuation benefit.

I remind the Treasurer that in the past three years his government has promised tax cuts of $14 billion but delivered tax increases of $18 billion.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has, since prior to the last election when it said it would not increase the overall burden of tax, taken various steps to reduce taxes. It did that in the Investing in the Nation statement particularly in relation to company tax, which was cut by six per cent from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, and the general investment allowance. We have also had the R&amp;D tax concession extended. We have had the ongoing loss of billions of dollars through the tariff reduction program, which this year is costing some $3.7 billion and by 1996-97 will be costing about $6 billion. Also, the first leg of the One Nation tax cuts came in earlier than promised&mdash;7 1/2 months before time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen, therefore, is a significant array of tax cuts. Certainly there have also been some tax increases, including those I announced last night. But what is absolutely the case is that the burden of taxation in Australia is less now than when the budget last moved into surplus. In 1995-96 we expect revenue to be 25.3 per cent of GDP, compared with 27.2 per cent when we last moved into surplus back in 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps even more important for the House to note is the fact that at 25.3 per cent of GDP it will be less than the 26 per cent of GDP which prevailed in the year 1982-83, the last year the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country. He was quite happy to have a tax rate of 26 per cent of GDP. That is higher than the level being proposed for 1995-96. In those circumstances, carrying on about the level of taxation and suggesting that the government is imposing some onerous burden of tax by a 25.3 per cent rate smacks of great hypocrisy. The House, by its lack of attention to this answer, is demonstrating that it doesn't think this is much of a question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Last night the Treasurer announced a cut in outlays for this year, with asset sales excepted from that, of some $700 million. There are, of course, spending commitments in the budget. Most of them were announced by the Treasurer last night while some of them had been announced prior to the budget, particularly in the form of assistance to the states to help them get on with the Hilmer reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you actually look at those outlays, you see that most of them are small in content and are well and truly justified, and the larger ones among them serve other purposes which improve the efficiency of the economy. For example, what is being done in families had its origins in discussions between the government and the trade union movement on wage restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was done in relation to the states was to ensure that the states delivered on a set of reforms that the Industry Commission estimates is going to produce a situation where there is some five per cent improvement in our GDP over time, which is a very good gain indeed. A lot of the other outlays commitments, the very substantial ones, relate to handling the situation that we have confronted with the drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gross savings entailed in this budget are $1.5 billion in the first year and $2 billion in each of the three out years. This comes off some very substantial tightening, some of it across programs, particularly in the health and education areas, and above all in the government's outlays. One that the Treasurer referred to last night, which goes to the indexation arrangement of the Commonwealth's own outlays, is a $2 billion cut over four years off $30 to $35 billion worth of expenditure&mdash;a very substantial change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the government's own housekeeping&mdash;the area where the opposition has from time to time said savings might be found&mdash;on top of a persistent 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend, now one per cent, that has been in place over a large number of years, there is now for most departments an extra two per cent and an obligation to absorb new policy proposals, the running costs associated with them, and that produces over $600 million worth of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, those outlays changes have contributed to this position with the budget; that is, in its second year of operation when the outlays changes and the tax changes have all come through to fruition they will contribute to $4 1/2 billion worth of fiscal tightening. The opposition says a couple of things about this. Firstly, it says that entailed in fiscal tightening there ought to be no involvement of a taxation system, no revenue raising. Secondly, it says that $4 1/2 billion is not adequate. Thirdly, it says that when it comes to the opposition paying for the various promises it wants to put down on improving, in its view, savings arrangements associated with the taxation system in going to the provision of a family taxation structure it will achieve additional savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that has produced is a situation where the opposition now has to explain where it is going to get $5 billion to $6 billion worth of cuts from. That is where the opposition is at. We, as a government, accept an obligation to explain where we are going. We have been working on that in the budget; the budget was produced last night. What I want to know from the opposition is: what is the secret agenda entailed in $5 billion to $6 billion worth of cuts before you go to additional cuts associated with your election undertakings or the ones that you propose to achieve to support your various taxation change measures? This is a very big ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have had, as a result of that leak before you, exactly what $5 billion worth of cuts per annum entails. Get out there and argue for it. If you are going to go through that cutting process, if you are going to need nothing on the taxation side, that is where you are at. The opposition frontbenchers are out there saying that no cuts ought to be entailed when it comes to their own individual portfolio areas. They are out there saying that as far as they are concerned they have one great idea after another about spending more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the time has come to ante-up&mdash;no more one-liners. You have made yourselves a commitment: $4 1/2 billion is not enough; no taxes ought to be entailed in it; extra savings ought to be gained.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case, as the House would be aware, that last night I announced the most comprehensive plan for national saving and retirement income that this country has ever seen. It built on our substantial efforts to this stage to change the superannuation system in this country so that, instead of being a privilege for the relatively well paid and high income earners, it is something which is extended to the great majority of the people in this country; with coverage now around 90 per cent, against the 40 per cent that prevailed when we came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that is the imposition of the superannuation guarantee arrangements, which has involved employers increasingly being required to make contributions to superannuation funds on behalf of employees. Those contributions go up to nine per cent by the year 2002. In July this year the contribution rate goes to six per cent for larger employers, to five per cent for smaller employers and then progressively moves up to that nine per cent level. That, in itself, is a substantial boost to the retirement incomes of Australians, both with the coverage involved and with the level of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I announced last night takes that a whole step further&mdash;with the three per cent from the employee and the three per cent matching contribution from the government&mdash;by redirecting the second tranche of the One Nation tax cuts into superannuation. By paying them in that way, we provide employees with a 15 per cent eventual benefit&mdash;15 per cent of their income going into superannuation each year. That means there will be a greatly enhanced retirement benefit for them and a greatly enhanced savings effort in this country, which is something the nation needs to have in circumstances where there has been a long-term decline in national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The improvement that this brings about is extraordinary. The combined effect of the employee contributions and the government matching contributions will mean that the funds in superannuation funds will go from a current $186 billion to nearly $2 trillion&mdash;that is, $2,000 billion&mdash;by the year 2020. That is an extraordinary amount of money. It reflects the fact that the enhanced payments made into superannuation funds by the vast majority of Australians will be building up immense amounts of money for investment in this nation. It will reduce the extent to which we need to call on the savings of foreigners to finance our investments and, therefore, it will improve our current account outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is both a medium- and a long-term strategy to address the only real weakness in the Australian economy at present&mdash;our deficiency in savings, our overreliance on the savings of foreigners. We obviously need to redress that. In the short term the measures being taken in the budget are very much directed to that. In the medium and longer term these steps in relation to superannuation are fundamentally important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also mean greatly enhanced retirement benefits for working people. It means that people on average weekly earnings will get $460,000 when they retire, as against the $260,000 in today's money they would have got through the superannuation guarantee. So it is a great enhancement in retirement benefits. From these developments we are seeing a very substantial improvement in national savings and retirement incomes. Clearly, all of this is highly beneficial to the future of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The treatment of asset sales in this budget is not an invention or creation of this government. The treatment of asset sales in this budget predated our accession to office and is very longstanding. It is consistent with current ABS and IMF practice. It is no different from what they require of us and, by any international standards, ours are well presented budget papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of legitimate reasons why asset sales ought to be included. Firstly, it is a case of consistency. The income stream from publicly owned assets is included. What we are effectively doing when we are selling them is capitalising on an income stream and we therefore lose it. Therefore, it is legitimate to have those included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason is also one of consistency. When we get out there and purchase something, that goes into the bottom line on outlays. If you want to go down the road of not including in the budget papers the government's capital spending&mdash;I suppose what you would mean by that is that when we purchase submarines and the defence department purchases property we ought not to be putting that capital spending in it; when we spend on roads, when we spend on schools, when we purchase government buildings, that ought not go in outlays. That is the logic of it. I tell you what: if we started to exclude $4 billion or $5 billion worth of defence expenditure and a few of the other items I am talking about, we would get a bottom line on the budget that really starts to rock'n'roll. If that were the position&mdash;that idiotic position which is apparently the position that those opposite want to adopt&mdash;those would be the consequences of it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that on this the opposition is not entirely consistent. Before it had some idea that there might be additional asset sales in the budget, the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters was questioned&mdash;journalists have not got around to you yet, sport, but they are a bit sick of your one-line smarminess out there and they will now want a bit of detail from you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Journalists started to try to get a bit of detail from you last week. When they started to ask obvious questions of you&mdash;like how are you going to pay for your family tax packages&mdash;what did you say? What did you say when you were invited by them to speculate on how you would pay for them? You said, `We have a program of asset sales which will reduce public debt interest.' Well, well, well! That does not go on the budget bottom line, does it? That is not a legitimate incorporation in your budget figuring!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did say that the treatment of asset sales in this budget was consistent with past practice in our budget documentation and consistent with ABS and IMF standards. It is, however, not consistent with past practice on announcements. For example, the first and only time that the opposition, when in government and when it had as its Treasurer John Howard, in the 1980-81 budget announced not a surplus but a domestic surplus. He was pleased to come  into  this House and  announce  in the budget statement that he had achieved a $39 million domestic surplus. Wasn't that a good performance as far as he was concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all there was in that budget speech. But, if you flicked your way through all the documentation, you got to budget document No. 4, and if you flicked through the pages of that document what did you find? You found asset sales of $181 million which had produced that domestic bottom line surplus. The difference between you, though, when you were in office and the Treasurer yesterday is that he walked straight into this place and was absolutely up-front about what it was that he intended to do. That is point one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Point two, and the second difference between us and you, is that according to your rules we are apparently not permitted to include asset sales on the bottom line of the budget figuring, as offsets to other activities, and changes in the public debt interest as a result of that but you incorporate them front and centre in your major savings exercise to pay for your taxation promises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for  his question. I have seen reports, particularly those attributed to the President of the Australian Council of Social Service in which he was very critical of what he alleged were savage cuts to the programs associated with Working Nation. I can inform the House that there are no savage cuts to the Working Nation programs. There are, in fact, no cuts to those programs at all. Further, there are real increases in what we are spending on Working Nation next year over this year. This year $1.7 billion has seen the remarkable improvement in the labour market. Next year we are spending $500 million more and the year after that we are spending more again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there are savings to the budget that come off the forward estimates. Some $1.1 billion of savings off forward estimates are associated with the Working Nation programs. Some $460 million of that $1.1 billion essentially comes from the more efficient and effective delivery of the program. This in turn comes from the fact that case management, because it can better identify the needs of the client, means that we are not guessing at what programs might matter: we know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say in passing that last year, when Working Nation was handed down, the same Mr Robert Fitzgerald from ACOSS had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program itself could fail to achieve real results unless the delivery measures are carefully structured and there is genuine commitment to efficient, effective and appropriate implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, that is what we have done, and in the process it is producing $460 million of savings off the forward estimates over the coming three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bulk of the remainder of the savings comes from the fact that we have had much stronger job growth than the job growth which was forecast in the last budget and which the other side said could never be achieved. If in fact we have got stronger job growth, what we were budgeting for last year in terms of the numbers of labour market programs needed over four years is less now than we thought it would be when we sat down 12 months ago. There is a growth dividend as well as an efficiency dividend that is paying for the savings off the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's commitment is still to achieving the five per cent target of unemployment in the terms that Working Nation spelt out. The changes that were made in the budget yesterday will see no deviation from that target or from the individual targeted measures that are necessary to achieve that&mdash;the job compact, the case management dimensions, and the labour market programs&mdash;apart from the growth factor.</PARA>

Total outlays on the age pension for the 1995-96 year will be some $12.1 billion, which is around 2 1/2 per cent of GDP and a $400 million real increase on outlays in the 1994-95 year. It is a very substantial commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This coming September we will be seeing a significant rise in pension rates. This will be a very substantial benefit for pensioners because it will be largely driven by a CPI increase, which itself is largely driven by mortgage housing costs, which do not impact greatly on most pensioners. So it will be a particularly useful and beneficial increase from the point of view of pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this commitment to major indexation of the pension even in circumstances where it produces a very large increase. I might say that that is in stark contrast to the performance of the opposition leader. In 1978 his first act as Treasurer was to reduce the frequency of pension indexation from six monthly to annually. The effect of that was to take one week's pension out of the pockets of pensioners in that six-month period. If we were to do the same thing under current circumstances, it would mean ripping $200 million off pensioners. That is the sort of commitment we see from the opposition in relation to the provision of an adequate age pension system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has announced that it has undertaken a major review of the pension income and assets test. As a result of that, we have announced a greatly simplified and improved system which removes the current plethora of different and complex arrangements and assessment methods for different kinds of investment vehicles. It substitutes for that a new approach where all financial investments&mdash;which includes deposits, managed investments, shares, debentures, bonds, et cetera&mdash;will be assessed on the same basis with a simple two-tier deeming structure: five per cent on the first $30,000 of single pensioners and the first $50,000 of married pensioner couples and seven per cent thereafter. This measure means that a great many pensioners really will have their circumstances enormously simplified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A single pensioner with financial assets whose only income was from financial assets of $42,000 or less will get a full rate pension and will not have to worry about share market fluctuations. It is likewise for pensioner couples with financial investments under $72,000. They will simply get the full rate pension&mdash;no worries; no problems. We have set the deeming rates in such a way that they can be achieved, even with the most conservative investment strategy. With term deposits now and the $5,000 for six months, they can get eight per cent, which is in the most secure kind of investment imaginable in excess of what we will be deeming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This set of changes has been overwhelmingly positively received by the pensioner organisations, by the finance industry and by the financial planning industry. Let me quote today's press release from the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. The press release, which is headed `Pension changes: a breath of fresh air', reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The new deeming system for pensioners' investments will significantly reduce the complexity and uncertainty experienced by older Australians," said Mrs Norah McGuire, National Secretary of the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation (AP&amp;SF), today in response to the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will be a breath of fresh air in the pension system. The new two level deeming system and the end to complex and onerous `savings provisions' will allow older people to invest with much greater flexibility and choice. It means a level playing field for older investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new deeming rate puts an incentive back into the system for people to organise their finances safely but also to get a decent return, as any returns above the 7% will not be counted.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a highly concessional regime. It is a vast simplification of current arrangements. It is a major benefit to pensioners and those who are predominantly dependent on the pension system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With great pleasure. I am delighted that last night's budget included additional funding of $610 million for the accelerated development of Badgerys Creek Airport, Sydney West Airport, by 1999. That will mean that a total of $762 million has been committed by the government to develop the airport site and the associated infrastructure. It will ensure that the airport will be available in time for the year 2000 Olympics. It will mean that we will have a second Sydney airport with a capacity sufficient to handle 94 per cent of all of our flights to international destinations as well as all domestic services. At the same time, it will have air traffic control, it will have firefighting services and it will have great facilities, as well as a 10,000 square metre terminal capable of handling up to 1.2 million passengers per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, by funding a national highway link to the M5 motorway and by working with the New South Wales government in reserving a rail corridor, the government is ensuring that the second airport will have adequate transport links both to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and to the Sydney CBD. Also included in the package is the acquisition of a further 50 hectares of land as well as the relocation of the Northern Road. We have seen the removal of any impediment to the future extension of the main runway to 4,000 metres and the later provision of a second 2,500 metre parallel runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides reserving a substantial site, besides planning the transport links in setting in place now a construction timetable beginning next year, we are determined to work with state and local government authorities to see that the surrounding land uses around Badgerys Creek are compatible with that airport development. By funding supplementary environmental studies to protect air quality, to protect water quality and to develop accurate noise exposure forecasts we are similarly determined to ensure that the environmental problems of Sydney's existing airport are not visited upon those living near the new airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are similarly determined to ensure that the environmental problems of Sydney's existing airport are not visited upon those living near the new airport. We are doing so because for too long Sydney's aviation infrastructure has suffered from short-term planning and a lack of integration. That approach has resulted in major capacity problems and an enormous burden upon the residents of Sydney's inner city. The business community, can I say, and the aviation industry have done nothing to discourage this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although those sitting opposite may interject, the fact is that the Liberal Party, at both state and federal level, has always been about expanding Kingsford Smith airport. Even now, the professed policy of the Leader of the Opposition is to see that airport running all three runways simultaneously, not to mention the policies of the Leader of the National Party who is on the record as saying that he wanted the curfew at Kingsford Smith airport relaxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we on this side of the House recognise the great community problems associated with that existing airport. We will seek to reduce the burden both by the $260m we have allocated for the noise insulation program and by bringing forward the development of the second Sydney airport. Unbelievable as it sounds, there are still those who say that Sydney does not need a second airport. Indeed, only last year the now defeated state Liberal government was telling me that it was not needed until the year 2015. The fact is that, when that first planning was done in 1985, there were projections of traffic use&mdash;and today we are where they said we would be in the year 2007. Sydney clearly needs a second airport, and that is exactly what this government intends to deliver.</PARA>

Let me just say that, if what you do is go to the budget papers&mdash;this might be difficult for you because, despite your past background, you have not shown too much of a capacity to actually research well or get to the detail&mdash;those budget papers show that, if we pick up on their forecasts for employment growth next year and their projections for the years thereafter, what is required is something in the order of 1.2 million jobs in the next six years to achieve the five per cent unemployment rate that we have projected and committed ourselves to.

That is because, although he maintains it was the opposition that was astonished by his headline figure in relation to the budget papers, there was no-one more astonished than him by the way in which this balance day transaction, this asset sale, this thing which the Labor Party said it would never do&mdash;that is, sell the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;was brought in at the last moment to try to cook the books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank was brought in in an attempt to try to cook the books. There is no surplus, no notional surplus, in relation to this budget. If you thumb through Budget Paper No. 1&mdash;and we had a lecture from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), Sir Toby Belch, you will recall, in question time about how you should thumb through budget papers&mdash;and get to page 7.3 you will find that the real ABS deficit measure is $8.2 billion. That is the outcome of this particular budget. </PARA>

You know that that notional surplus is in fact a real deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What also occurred last night was the final act of the great fraud of the 1993 election. You will recall that the Treasurer, his Minister for Finance, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and every one of those backbenchers went to the 1993 election not on a promise of income tax cuts but on legislated income tax cuts which the Prime Minister said was l-a-w. If the Prime Minister had kept faith with the Australian people, on 1 January next year they would be receiving income tax cuts. But as the whole of Australia knows in relation to those cuts the l-a-w was the great l-i-e of the 1993 election campaign. Last night the income tax cuts that were l-a-w were j-u-n-k-e-d, junked. No taxpayer will receive one cent in one dollar for one day under those income tax cuts due on 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will get round in a moment to the way in which the Prime Minister, the great deceiver, is trying to extricate himself from that fraud, but the important point to bear in mind is that the last election was won on a fraud&mdash;this government asked the people of Australia to elect it so they could receive those income tax cuts. Last night was not the last word in relation to the income tax One Nation fraud; last night we also saw this government increase company tax by another 3c. You have heard the Minister for Finance this afternoon say, `Oh, yes, but in the past it was 46c.' I will tell you this, Treasurer: in the past there was no fringe benefits tax, no superannuation guarantee charge and no capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you what, if the small businesses of this country could get rid of the fringe benefits tax they might be interested in your income tax increase. But the fringe benefits tax has turned into one of the great growth taxes of your regime, and you know it. It is not just the amount that is raised by it; it is the complexity of dealing with it. That was a promise that was also made in Investing in the Nation. Do you remember all those statements? We did not have a `nation' last night. Remember we had One Nation, Investing in the Nation, then Working Nation, then Creative Nation. Last night we had damnation as a result of the income tax fraud that you brought in. </PARA>

I thought she would probably say that, when she made that statement, the bells were ringing and she had to run into the parliament; maybe she could not have a recollection; or maybe it was the case that she was just trying to deceive the Australian people. Maybe that was the case in relation to the Medicare levy. </PARA>

The letter put to you in question time this afternoon, which was written by you as the Minister for Finance on 24 September 1993 to the people who invested in the Commonwealth Bank, said that the government had no intention whatever of further reducing its shareholding.

It says it would apply to people who start work in 2002&mdash;in seven years time&mdash;who would get it in their first year of retirement in the year 2042. So the Prime Minister is saying, `You wouldn't want any money from me now; you would rather leave it to 2042.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is very free with allegations of fraud. One expects that from him because that is the kind of language we normally get. The fact is that the first round of One Nation tax cuts was paid 7 1/2 months earlier than originally promised. The payments were received in November 1993, so there was no fraud there. They were 100 per cent paid 7 1/2 months earlier than originally promised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second level of those tax cuts, as announced last night, will be honoured in the sense that they are to be paid into superannuation funds as matching payments to employee contributions and the eventual payment early in the next century will become considerably greater than the amount of the tax cuts and be greater thereafter. So let me refute absolutely, completely and utterly any suggestion of fraud by this government in relation to the One Nation tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first lot were unambiguously paid 7 1/2 months earlier than promised. The second lot, which were announced by me last night, are to be paid by way of payments into superannuation funds and in a way which not only meets the national good because they will be saved but also means they will eventually have a greater impact for individuals than if they had been paid as tax cuts. So where is the fraud in that? Obviously, this is a meeting of the commitment in a very substantial way and a most appropriate way given the circumstances of the nation at present and the clear need to do something to improve our national savings task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other allegation of fraud that we get from this person opposite who is free with these sorts of accusations relates to the Commonwealth Bank. As I already said at question time on this issue, clearly there has been a change of policy by the government. Of course there has. It was our policy not to sell the Commonwealth Bank. We have changed that policy. Does that mean that there was fraud when we made that decision? That was our policy at the time. There was no intention then to change that policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I reject absolutely, completely and utterly this cheap accusation of fraud and these histrionics about going to the ASC. This sort of cheap politics is all we get from the opposition in substitution for real policy. We never hear from those opposite anything about real policy. All we get is this carry-on about fraud, cheats and lies and those sorts of schoolboy accusations&mdash;no real policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a man speaking the day after the budget as the shadow Treasurer. Has he said one word about economic policy? Does he have anything to say about the budget? Does he have anything to say about what should be done? Does he have anything to say about what the opposition's policy is on budgets&mdash;anything at all? Is there anything there or is there just a complete vacuum with a few one-liners. That is all it is. That is all he does&mdash;churns out the one-liners and has absolutely nothing of substance to say. We have a completely hollow opposition&mdash;a policy-free zone; full on with criticisms; absolutely, totally and utterly lacking in any substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite put up some substance in Fightback they got burned, and they feel they are not going to do it again. As we move towards the next election, I assume the Australian people will want to hear something from this opposition about what its policies are&mdash;whether it has any policies and, if so, what they will be. I think the clear strategy of the opposition is to leave it to the very last minute to ensure that the electorate has little time in which to evaluate whatever skimpy policies it might put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On tax cuts I should also say that the performance of this government in relation to the One Nation tax cuts stands in stark contrast to the performance of the then government back in the 1970s when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer and in the 1977 election, when there were promises of a fistful of dollars by way of a billion dollars worth of tax cuts by the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. After the election the then Treasurer, the now Leader of the Opposition, came into this parliament and took away those tax cuts. They came in February 1978; they were taken away in the budget of that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about fraud, how about that for a classic example? The tax cuts were taken away after the election which had been won on the basis of this fistful of dollars. That is real fraud. If we want to talk about fraud, that is real fraud. The person who did it is no other than the Leader of the Opposition now, who was then the Treasurer. He took away those tax cuts, said he was doing it on a temporary basis and then came back the next year and said, `Oh, hang on. Sorry about the temporary basis. We're going to take them away again,' and extended their abolition for a further period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to talk about fraud, there were two frauds by the now Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer in cancelling tax cuts. If you want to talk about fraud on tax cuts, go back and look at your own house; get your own house in order before you start making accusations about us. Get rid of a leader who engaged in fraudulent activity and then you might be able to make some criticisms if you want to&mdash;but not of us in relation to the One Nation tax cuts, because they have been delivered. They have been delivered in full for the first round early and for the second round in the way in which I have explained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to superannuation, what this government is proposing is of immense benefit to the people of this country. What is the opposition proposing? What would the opposition do? Of course, if you asked what would it do in any area you would not have much idea, but in relation to superannuation what would the opposition do? We know from the last election that it would freeze the superannuation guarantee where it stood. That is, it would have been happy to freeze the employer contribution at five per cent and that is where it would have remained. The benefits we are giving through a 15 per cent arrangement would have been five per cent under the opposition. Of course, that means far less in the way of retirement benefits to Australian workers and it means far less in the way of a national savings boost through the superannuation guarantee, the employee contributions and the matching contribution from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This boost to savings, which I think is generally recognised as important to be done, would not be occurring under an opposition which would freeze the SG, the superannuation guarantee, at five per cent. It would not be able to introduce employee contributions in the way in which we are proposing through the awards, because the accord is relied upon substantially for that to happen. The unions have to make the applications, and we will support those applications, but it would not be happening without the accord. It would not be happening under the coalition if it were in government, and the amounts going into superannuation would be five per cent, not 15 per cent. Therefore, the retirement benefits would be far less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a very important point to take into account. If we believe that there is a need to have superannuation improved in this country to improve savings, then only this government can and will produce it. We have shown a very effective way in which that can be done whilst, at the same time, honouring the promise in relation to the second round of the One Nation tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of the budget is also said to be an area of fraud.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In combing through all our outlays, we have been able to make some notable savings, even though we have a very small public sector in comparison with most other countries. This budget will make that public sector even smaller. Outlays will fall from 26.7 per cent of GDP this year to 24 per cent in 1998-99. So we will see a further reduction in this public sector, which is already just about the smallest public sector in the Western industrialised world. Only New Zealand and the United States are smaller, and even then just fractionally so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the tax increases I announced last night, the  fact is that the tax burden on the people of Australia is less than that of almost every other country in the Western industrialised world. That means that the Australian people are not being imposed on by taxation. Indeed, the tax levels that we are applying are less than those applied by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer when he had revenue as a proportion of GDP at 26 per cent as against the 25.3 per cent we calculate for 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means we are not taxing as heavily as the Leader of the Opposition thought was appropriate to impose on the Australian people when he was last in my position.

We are not heavily taxing the Australian people, either by past precedent or in comparison with other countries. We are one of the lowest tax countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more the budget is examined, the more shonky it appears to be. We saw that when it was released last night. The media jumped on the first-up impressions and the value of the currency went up. Then, 15 minutes later, when they had had a preliminary look at it, the currency started to move back down again. As reality sets in, it becomes quite widely known across the country that that deficit turnaround is just not dinky-di. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying deficit is in fact around $8 billion&mdash;a worryingly high figure. It reflects the reality that the government is still not prepared to live within its means. By extension, the government is not prepared to allow the rest of us and the nation as a whole to get on with the business of trying to get back our living within its means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Buried in this documentation is the prediction that we are looking at a $27 billion trade deficit over the coming financial year. In other words, after five months of seeing the trade deficit being over $2 billion on a monthly basis&mdash;$2.3 billion last time&mdash;everybody turns around and says, `It's not as bad as it could have been.' They say that everything is all right and we are encouraged to go back to sleep. We are going to see more of those figures, and they are going to be worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is $27 billion on a monthly basis? It is worse than we have seen, yet nothing is being done to help the people who can most do something about turning that situation around such as exporters and those with a capacity to import replace on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate for a moment on what this budget and the sorts of attendant government policies do to those people out in rural and regional Australia who are responsible for about two-thirds of this nation's export dollars in one way or another. The fact is that again they are hit for six. The budget continues the pattern of discrimination against the national interest by discriminating against those who export, those who have the potential to turn around this nation's horrifying trade imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is a shop full of the sorts of inconsistencies that discourage investment and create uncertainty to fuse the prospect of anybody being able to plan ahead with their investment decisions. There is no better example that exists of that than the changed company tax. It has been changed yet again. The good reasons given a couple of years ago are now supplanted by the fact that there have been five minutes of economic sunshine out there and companies are supposedly making a fortune. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see it too with the inconsistencies in relation to public ownership of things like the Commonwealth Bank which is really interesting. The one thing that arises out of the interchanges that have gone on here this afternoon that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) did not explain is when caucus found out about his and the Prime Minister's intentions. When were they informed about this? One assumes that at some stage&mdash;we will give them the benefit of some doubt in all of this&mdash;they thought to consult the directors. When were the directors consulted? One might reasonably assume that that was done before caucus was informed. Caucus might like to ask the Treasurer and the Prime Minister what that says about the new `snuggle us all in' consultative process in the build-up to the budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does not trust his own caucus. Let caucus take that one up. This question of our export trade imbalance is very critical, particularly to the people in rural and regional Australia whom those of us on this side of the House represent. As I have said, that is where two-thirds of the nation's export performance is still generated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to a couple of things, and inflation is one of them. Obviously, as the commentators and the observers were saying, it was important that this budget seriously grappled the question of government expenditure, seriously attempted to rein in the excesses because it is necessary to take the pressure off inflation and thereby interest rates, at the same time we were seeking to boost domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the budget have to say about inflation? It actually predicts a rise in the underlying rate from around two per cent in rough terms to four per cent. The rule of thumb is that a one per cent rise in inflation will produce about a 1 1/2 per cent rise in interest rates. So watch out farmers and small businessmen who are in trouble out there because, despite the rhetoric about this being designed to hold inflation and interest rates down, you should expect on the budget's own figures a probable rise in interest rates of about three per cent. Farmers will really appreciate that. That is about another $580 million on their current debt load. What that does for our competitiveness in Asia is anybody's guess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the taxes on business, which I touched on a moment ago, which are up from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. It gives us one of the highest in the regime. Only Japan, India and Bangladesh have higher taxes on business in aggregate terms. Exports lost equals higher deficits, fewer jobs and lower living standards. Where does it end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to another interesting one: tax on transport. I find it very interesting that a tax on motor cars has gone up just when the motoring market starts to recover a bit in this country. There are some interesting aspects to this. Firstly, it disproportionately disadvantages rural and regional Australia at a time when rural and regional Australia, as important as it is, is down and out. Secondly, we have one of the oldest car fleets in the world. Remember that the objective of the cheaper unleaded fuel was to get more people to drive newer cars for the purposes of looking after the environment. What does this say about the government's commitment in that regard? It is just another milch cow for a government that will not get its economic house in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is little wonder that the general public treats this chamber with growing contempt, given those who now control it, and cynicism when the man who occupies the highest office in this land so seriously betrays the trust put in him by the Australian people. The only message arising out of that is that it is time that you lot went. The sooner you take us to the polls the sooner you give the Australian people the chance to do that which is long overdue&mdash;that is, throw you out. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this matter of public importance, there are a number of things that should be said in relation to last night's budget. The key things we need to relate go back to the things outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) at the mid-year review in January 1995. At that time we made it clear that there were a number of key parameters that were going to be the focus for this year's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were determined to ensure that we maintained a sustainable rate of economic growth. We were determined to ensure that the level of inflation was kept at the lowest possible level. We were determined to ensure that interest rates were kept at the lowest possible level. We were determined to ensure that employment growth, which has been at record levels in the last two years, was continued. And we were determined to ensure that the fiscal consolidation process was accelerated in order to meet the current account demands that were showing through in the quarterly accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the parameters outlined at the mid-year review in January 1995 and compare them with last night's budget outcome, I think we can genuinely say that, far from the MPI suggestion about the level of deception in the budget, we have delivered on each of those key elements. We have a budget that is now into surplus and a determination in 1996-97 to accelerate that surplus structurally, as well as the surplus we have achieved this year with the overall program of revenue measures, outlays cuts and also asset sale items. We have made it clear that in next year's budget that surplus will be extended far greater than has been outlined in the medium-term deficit reduction strategy of the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then move to the measures contained in the budget that relate to savings. The key element of savings in the short term is to ensure that the Commonwealth, the public sector, call on savings is diminished. By achieving the surplus we have in this year's budget we have achieved that massive turnaround. We have gone from a $12.2 billion deficit to a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the plans for the longer term in relation to the surplus. In 1996-97, it is expected the surplus will be $3.4 billion or over half a per cent of GDP. That is a dramatic improvement in the result outlined in last year's budget where we said that we would achieve a deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP. This year and next year there will be a massive improvement in our position. Therefore, the Commonwealth's call on savings will be dramatically reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to the later years, we look at the superannuation arrangements. The opposition does not like these sorts of arrangements. It has never believed that superannuation is the prerogative of the majority of the work force. Those opposite would like to go back to the old days where it was the prerogative of 30 to 40 per cent of the work force and people did not have access to superannuation through the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made it clear through the award arrangements, more recently under the superannuation guarantee arrangements and under the new saving strategy outlined last night by the Treasurer that we are determined to have all workers achieve a 15 per cent superannuation savings target. The contribution that makes to national savings for the longer term is immense. There have been numerous studies done in this area. People quote international experience in this regard. The most recent study was conducted by the World Bank. It highlights what an excellent model our savings regime is and points out that it is encouraging other OECD countries of a similar age and demographic profile to us to adopt a similar style model as far as savings for the longer term are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the regime works. It has added $186 billion in savings held in superannuation. We know that it is adding significantly to the retirement incomes of Australians and we also know that it will make a major contribution&mdash;indeed, a four per cent contribution&mdash;to national savings over the next 25 years. All of those things are a reflection of the fact that the budget is not only designed to meet the short-term, immediate demands that the Commonwealth has to get a surplus but also designed to ensure that we have a national savings regime that the whole community can be a part of and by which the government can honour its commitment to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning in relation to taxation matters that the first round of the One Nation tax promises were delivered seven months early, in November 1993. The second round is now to be paid by the government as part of the superannuation commitment. They will be delivered. Over time the delivery of those measures will amount to a very substantial enhancement of the original taxation cuts that were outlined in One Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about those measures is that they provide the right balance in terms of equity and the taxation benefits. If we look at the first round of tax cuts, we find that they went to people in the $20,000 to $50,000 income range with a low income tax rebate. If we look at the arrangements outlined, we find that they go to people on below average weekly earnings, on average weekly earnings and a little above average weekly earnings. The sense of equity and the purpose of this tax benefit delivered through the superannuation arrangements the Treasurer outlined last night is immense. It is a big win for superannuation for the average worker, women and people in casual employment and it will also be a major win as time goes on for national savings. That is the way to fix the current account problem over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer made clear that resolving the current account problem was going to be a strategy for a number of years. The turnaround that we achieved in this year's budget cycle is a major contribution. We are ensuring that there is a reduction, as a percentage of GDP, in the current account deficit in 1995-96. It has come down from somewhere near 6 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will do significantly better than that, as the budget papers make clear, over the next few years because we have this strong savings strategy that all Australians in the work force will participate in and get real benefits from. They will make their contributions to maximising their own retirement income and, at the same time, they will be doing something productive for the nation in building our national savings pool&mdash;something that we all acknowledge is a matter of high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we have acknowledged that it is a matter of high priority, it is worth contrasting that we now have a strategy that encompasses over 90 per cent of the work force in superannuation. When the Liberals were last in office, for all their talk about what they believed about savings, less than 45 per cent of the work force had access to superannuation. The reality is that we now have a savings plan that is real for all Australians rather than a `top end of town' approach that applied when the Liberals where last in office. At that time there were massive superannuation concessions at the top end and no access to superannuation for those at the other end of the scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the other important elements of the budget. We have made clear that we are going to ensure sustainable economic growth. That is important. The member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) in his contribution referred to inflation. One of the keys to ensuring economic growth is maintaining low inflation. There is no argument about that. The budget makes clear that we are going to ensure that we keep the focus on inflation. We are going to do that in a number of ways. We are going to have a further round of the accord process to ensure that we have a proper wages strategy as part of the cycle to ensure inflation is kept low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is continually negative about the accord and the arrangements between the trade union movement and the government. One of the reasons we will get low inflation in a sustainable way is that there is a proper focus on the real wage position through the accord process. The opposition has said nothing about how it will try to tackle the questions relating to the maintenance of low inflation. It might say that it will give the governor of the bank an edict or something like that. It has not adopted a sustainable policy in that regard. Indeed, I could apply that to most other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of the one-liners used by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) there was not one shred of policy that suggested how the opposition would meet the targets or the commitments that it is making about families. With all of the commitments that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), his successor and the opposition have been entering into, there is not one ounce of policy as to how they might pay for them. We know the sort of scare campaign that those opposite are trying to run at us, but there is not one ounce of policy on their part. There has been no attempt to provide any substance to the community. There has been no attempt to do anything to enlighten the community about how it would ensure low inflation, strong economic growth, strong employment and a sustainable capacity to deal with our current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget that we delivered, all of those things are covered well and responsibly. This year we have a budget surplus and a massive turnaround. In future years there will be a very strong commitment to national savings both through the government making less call on savings and through those in the community saving. They will be doing that in a way that provides a real benefit to them. It will maximise their retirement incomes and, therefore, give them real scope to develop their lifestyles and to plan properly for their futures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Consultative Delegation to Vietnam from 5 to 12 April 1995 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia-Vietnam dialogue: the currents of change</EMPHASIS>. Between 5 and 12 April this year Senator Stephen Loosley, the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, led a delegation, of which I was the deputy leader, to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I think it can be said that this delegation was born originally in controversy and ended up being an exercise that was ultimately very successful. Both sides of politics have played their part ultimately in ensuring that the exercise was a success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became the shadow minister for foreign affairs in February of this year, the exercise was already relatively mature. My predecessors, the previous shadow ministers for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and Mr Peacock, had been engaged in some controversy over whether this delegation would go or not. When I became the shadow minister for foreign affairs, I made it clear to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that the coalition would be prepared to participate in this delegation provided that three conditions were met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these conditions was that Vietnamese Australians should be able to form part of the delegation. The second condition was that Australia should be able to choose the membership of the delegation, and that it was not a matter for the Vietnamese government. The third condition was that the delegation should have a genuine human rights role, including undertaking visits to prisons and the like in Vietnam. After some period of delay, Senator Evans was able to inform me that the conditions the coalition had laid down would be met. Ultimately, the delegation set off in early April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that during our visit we were reminded of the importance to Australia of Vietnam and the gradual emergence of that country. After all, it has a very substantial population and therefore significant economic potential. At the moment, per capita GDP in Vietnam is extremely low. Nevertheless, as a result of substantial changes in economic policy in 1986, known as doi moi, or the opening up of the Vietnamese economy and the introduction of some of the more enlightened elements of capitalism, that country is achieving at long last relatively high rates of growth which are comparable to the rates of growth in other parts of south-east and much of north-east Asia. Indeed, economic growth in Vietnam is now running at between eight and 10 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should remind us that a country, which admittedly is poor at the moment, with a population of 80 million and high rates of economic growth does have real potential. Already there are a few Australian businesses that have understood that potential. I particularly mention BHP, which has quite significant investments in Vietnam, and Telecom&mdash;or Telstra as it likes to call itself&mdash;which has a record of great success in Vietnam. It is important that we pay tribute to the imaginative work of Telstra in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the importance of Vietnam is quite clearly economic importance, but it is also a country of growing strategic importance. In the middle of this year Vietnam will become a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations. Given the importance of ASEAN to Australia and the very high priority we as a country have to place on our relationship with ASEAN, the fact that Vietnam is a member of that body will in itself make Vietnam a great deal more important strategically to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very laudable ambition of many Australians to link the ASEAN Free Trade Area proposal with what we have already achieved in CER&mdash;I hope we make more progress in that area&mdash;is obviously, amongst other things, going to involve the development of our bilateral relations with Vietnam. It is very important that people understand the significance of Vietnam to us not only economically but also in that broader strategic sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there is no doubt that this is a difficult relationship for us to develop. Although Australia has probably made more progress in a relationship with Vietnam than almost any other developed country, it is still a relationship which is difficult for us. First, there are the historic factors. There is the fact that Australia participated in the Vietnam war and, therefore, the legacy that is left from that in terms of our sentiments towards Vietnam, or at least the Hanoi administration in Vietnam, in many parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, one would expect that there would be a degree of antipathy in Vietnam&mdash;not all of Vietnam but at least amongst the North Vietnamese and those who supported the North Vietnamese government in the south during the period of the Vietnam War&mdash;towards Australians. But I have to say that the experience of our delegation was that whilst the Vietnamese have not forgotten the Vietnam War&mdash;there are traces of the war all over the country&mdash;there is no doubt that they do not wish past antipathy to continue into the future. We do have that legacy, and that does create a difficulty in our relationship. As time goes on, inevitably the impact of that participation in the Vietnam War will simply dissipate. We have very legitimate human rights concerns. Indeed, it was our concern about human rights which was a very dominant part&mdash;though it was not the only part&mdash;of the work of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are crucially important issues to a country like Australia. If we want to achieve a greater degree of regional stability and security than we already enjoy and if we want that to be sustainable ad infinitum, then we have to make sure that there is a spread of both democracy and understanding of human rights throughout our region. This was a point that the delegation made during its visit to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, a lot of our work on the visit focused on these sorts of issues. On the first day of our visit to Hanoi, all members of the delegation signed a letter to the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs expressing our concern about particular individuals whom we believe are held in detention in Vietnam. We gave that letter by hand to the vice-minister, as the report points out. A copy of the letter is published at the back of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the visit, we also raised our concerns about issues such as freedom of religion. We had the opportunity to talk with some of the members of the Buddhist church, in particular in the former imperial capital of Hue. We spoke with the Catholic Archbishop of Hanoi and visited a Catholic church in Ho Chi Minh city on Maundy Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusions we reached were that in Vietnam there is a degree of religious freedom, particularly in terms of practising religion. People are able to worship as Buddhists or Catholics and in some other religions as well, and they are able to do so relatively unhindered. On Maundy Thursday in the Catholic cathedral in Ho Chi Minh city, Saigon, there must have been a good 2,000 people. It was absolutely jam-packed. There is a degree of freedom of religion, but there are limitations on that freedom of religion. In particular, we made representations about the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, which we believe has not enjoyed the freedom that the so-called official Buddhist church has enjoyed. There is clearly some obstruction by the Hanoi government of appointments within the Catholic Church and even, it would appear, appointments by the Catholic Church to seminaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as political activity is concerned, we also expressed our concern that political dissent, at least public political dissent, was not tolerated. Certainly, whilst private political dissent, it would appear, is tolerated, public dissent is not. We made those points fairly forcefully to the Vietnamese. They put their case to us very forcefully as well. There is no doubt that the Vietnamese share one characteristic with Australians&mdash;they tend to say pretty much what they think. You would describe the exchanges that we had on some of these issues as definitely friendly and certainly frank. They genuinely were very frank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I would make about the limitations that we have so far confronted in our relationship with Vietnam is that there is a degree of local sensitivity here in Australia. We have about 150,000 Vietnamese Australians. The concerns of those people do not just arise out of the Vietnam War but also out of the 10 or so years following the Vietnam War, when there was widespread persecution in Vietnam and when people who had been associated with the former South Vietnamese regime, the Republic of Vietnam, had been subjected to so-called re-education camps and the like. Inevitably amongst Vietnam's Australians there is great sensitivity about the way that many of them and their friends and relations were treated during that period and during the Vietnam War. That is something that any government in Australia has to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to be sensitive to the concerns of our Vietnam War veterans. Some of the comments that people have made in recent weeks in the context of the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon about Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War are extremely crass and insensitive to our own Vietnam War veterans, and in particular to the families of those Australians who fell during the Vietnam War. I have heard some extraordinarily insensitive remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no doubt that there are some difficulties in our relationship, but what we have been able to do during this visit is to identify areas where we should continue to engage in dialogue with the Vietnamese so that those difficulties can be worked out in a constructive and mature sort of way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude I want to make one point which is not given much coverage in the report. During our discussions with the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in Hanoi I raised with him the possibility of Australia being able to build some sort of monument, a memorial, to our Vietnam War veterans and, in particular, to those Australians who died in Vietnam at Long Tan. This was, I have to confess, not warmly received. The impression I got was that the Vietnamese did not want such memorials built on their territory. But after further discussion about this issue the Vice Foreign Minister did suggest that it might be possible for us to build some type of institution such as a school, a hospital, a medical clinic or whatever in that region and that that could be a memorial to those Australians in particular who lost their lives in the Vietnam War. There needs to be further discussion with Vietnam on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a basis for a very good relationship with Vietnam, but I do not think we should ignore the difficulties that exist. We should not sweep them away and pretend they do not matter, because the difficulties that do exist are a matter of concern. What we have been able to do through this delegation is establish a dialogue with the Vietnamese on those issues. We have also been able to make the point that it is a relationship that is important to Australia. As Australians we need more broadly to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank Senator Loosley for the role he played as the leader of the delegation. He was certainly a good leader of the delegation, a very entertaining and educated leader of the delegation. I know that he will be sorely missed as a member of this parliament by the many who have been associated with him. The other members of the delegation all got on well together and could be described as a happy team. I would like to thank Phong Bui and Bill Parker from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who were exceptionally professional in their work and in the assistance they provided to the delegation. I also thank Sue Boyd, our ambassador in Vietnam, and many of her staff. As we have come to expect from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in almost all circumstances, they did an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I thank our hosts with the National Assembly of Vietnam for all the hospitality they provided. It was a unique delegation in that it was the first delegation by any Western country of this type to Vietnam. I think we have set the scene for future visits not just by Australian delegations but by delegations from other industrialised countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate, as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has done, those involved in this delegation, including him, Senators Loosley and Bourne and, importantly, the Vietnamese-Australian members of the delegation. This is a significant report not only for what it says in terms of the specific recommendations that it makes but also, as my friend the honourable member for Mayo has indicated, in that it is the last report that Senator Loosley will sign in this parliament. I take the opportunity, having officially farewelled Senator Loosley earlier today, to acknowledge his contribution in the foreign affairs, defence and trade portfolio areas in this parliament. I am sure I join with all of my colleagues on both sides of the House in wishing Senator Loosley every success in the legal profession, which I understand he will be participating in after he leaves the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record a number of specific points that are in this report and also reaffirm and re-emphasise some of the points that have been made by my colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs in terms of the bilateral relationship between Australia and Vietnam. The report re-emphasises one or two points that the member for Mayo has made. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exchanges were somewhat robust but discussions were always valuable. No issue was regarded as too difficult. The delegation was able to make contact with a wide range of people who were outside official structures and who were independent of government channels. This included critics of some aspects of government policy.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The war years remain a significant feature of Vietnamese political culture. This has resulted in a strong sense of independence and national pride and a reserve toward any suggestion of being dictated to by outsiders. It has also resulted in a persisting tradition of wartime mechanisms of political control and sensitivity about security. At the same time, Vietnam is eager to put the past behind it and to work cooperatively with other countries to improve its standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam is a country in transition . . . the former Marxist economic orthodoxy has been jettisoned and replaced by a developing free market approach. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the general standard of living of the people though it has been accompanied by growing inequalities between individuals and regions. In the process, there has been a gradual relaxation of political control over private behaviour. This has also enhanced the general quality of life in Vietnam. As a result, Vietnam's ability to observe economic, social and cultural rights has improved . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in part, the media release of the delegation on departing Vietnam stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was an effective dialogue opened up at these levels which ranged from discussions with the supreme court to a visit to a prison.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond official contact, the delegation was also able to discuss matters of interest with religious leaders, the diplomatic, legal and business communities, expatriate Australians and international agencies. Perhaps more significantly, Vietnamese Australian members of the delegation were able to move unescorted and to meet and talk freely with ordinary Vietnamese people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the delegation met with intellectual and political critics of the Vietnamese government . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To suggest therefore that the delegation was permitted to hear only an official view of Vietnam is clearly nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA>I would also point out that Vietnam will only increase in importance both to Australia and to the Asia-Pacific region. Increasingly, we are seeing rapid transformation in the Vietnamese economy and with it, inevitably, Vietnamese society. As the honourable member for Mayo said, it is a rapidly growing economy, but it is still an economy under the rule of one party. It has a relatively poor record of human rights protection. It does have high levels of persistent relative poverty. But that said, of course it has a pivotal role in Indochinese affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore suggest, as indeed the shadow minister has suggested quite recently in a public forum, that Australia's objectives in its relationship with Vietnam should be, firstly, to encourage Vietnam to become integrated within the regional economic and security structure; secondly, to help in the improvement of living conditions through a process of economic modernisation and contribution of our skills and resources; thirdly, to promote the cause of human rights&mdash;and this report goes a long way down that path&mdash;and, finally, to encourage bilateral trade and investment. Our objectives with Vietnam therefore must be to assist it to reintegrate, reconstruct and rehabilitate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so doing, that bilateral relationship between our two countries should be governed, as always, by a set of principles. Those principles must reflect enduring universally accepted values which ultimately seek to serve our long-term national interests and our responsibilities. Those principles, I would suggest, are simple: first of all, the need for Vietnam to be involved in a free market and, secondly, the observance of the dignity and rights of the people within Vietnam. We cannot, as the honourable member has said, simply pay lip-service to the issues of human rights, even if it causes the Australian or Vietnamese government discomfort. We also cannot allow cases of arbitrary abuse to be swept aside. Finally, we must ensure that Australia's actions are governed by a genuine commitment to the principles of freedom and commerce and, most importantly, a respect for individual dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Mayo said, a lot of Australian firms are involved in various areas in Vietnam. Australian legal firms have been involved for some time; Telstra is involved in the telecommunications system; the ANZ Bank is and has been involved there for at least a couple of years; AIDAB, or its previous incarnation, assisted in the preparation of a mining code; and of course, as the honourable member for Mayo said, BHP's $1 billion investment in the Dai Hung offshore petroleum field is of great benefit indeed to both countries. In that process, the Australian government and firms need to be involved in constructive and mutually acceptable suggestions. We need to provide aid in the form of skills training and, where necessary, we need to honestly appraise the bureaucratic inefficiencies which undoubtedly exist. And, of course, we also need to involve Vietnamese residents themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian aid to Vietnam is very substantial and, as the honourable member for Mayo also said, we need to generally support the Vietnamese membership of the ASEAN community. That will be an important step in the process of reintegrating Vietnam into the regional economy and the other key pillars of South-East Asia's regional architecture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can play a useful role in the reintegration, reconstruction and rehabilitation of Vietnam within the South-East Asian region. Vietnam has an extraordinary contribution to make to Australia and the region. The contribution of the Vietnamese community within Australia of course is rich and vital in that bilateral dialogue. Australia can help with the aspirations of Vietnamese people to attain better living standards and to strive for political freedoms which will allow for the full flowering of their culture. Australia can help also by conducting its relations with Vietnam in conjunction with the principles to which I referred earlier and with the full respect for human dignity, of both itself and the Vietnamese people generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report reflects a very positive step in that direction. Clearly, it was a very successful mission. Once again, I thank and congratulate all those members of the delegation. The report indeed presents a very large and wide comparison to comments that were made by a Vietnamese academic back in 1978, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Saigon fell to the communists from the north on 30th April, 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next day, they ordered all political parties, all religious groups, all social and charitable organisations to stop functioning immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The communist troops occupied the headquarters and offices of all political or religious groups . . . A week after the fall of Saigon, the government ordered all members of the armed forces of the old regime to present themselves for a `ten days' re-education session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 600,000 people were then sent to various re-education centres&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or, to be unkind, concentration camps. That, thankfully, is a thing of the past. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to be able to sum up the debate on the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill 1995, albeit I am speaking some time after my colleagues have made their learned contributions. I will take this opportunity to reply to some of the remarks that were made by honourable members, and in particular those made by the shadow minister, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). The shadow minister and a number of other speakers in the debate raised some matters that certainly merit some response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear, as I have reiterated on a number of occasions, that the government has been quite committed and remains committed to ensuring that the pension safety net is there for all those who continue to rely on it. The analyses show that many in the community will rely at least partly on the age pension for decades to come. Despite the suggestion made today by the member for Bradfield, the government has a strong commitment to maintaining the pension above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That was confirmed in last night's budget papers, and it will be an ongoing commitment on the part of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knows that an impact has been felt in the small accounts area and that that needs to be addressed. That is precisely why this package of bills is coming before the parliament. It will provide the protection that those with small superannuation accounts deserve. The reason why we need this package is evident, given the sorts of examples that we heard today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package is much broader than the SHAR mechanism&mdash;the Taxation Office collection mechanism&mdash;that was referred to. The suggestion that the government proposes to have a massive superannuation fund at the tax office is absolutely wrong. My second reading speech and the explanatory memorandums associated with the bills make it clear that the tax office collection mechanism is there as a last resort. It is for when employers cannot find a fund to direct employees' superannuation payments which is appropriate and provides protection for members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the package we have outlined and the time sequence we have adopted&mdash;which requires the member protection arrangements by way of the regulation to be gazetted, as we did in April, and requires the transfer protocol arrangements to be pressed on as vigorously as we have&mdash;we expect the industry to meet the large measure of the solution to the small amounts problem. That was made clear in the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis). </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Connolly" NAMEID="QF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr Connolly</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When are we going to see the protocol?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The industry is working very hard on the transfer protocol now. In the second reading speech, I made it clear that the government places a high priority on the transfer protocol. I agree that that is a very important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we also know from the feedback we have had to date is that the member protection arrangements will apply very broadly. The SHAR mechanism was the major issue portrayed by opposition speakers in the debate. We reiterate our position: it will be the last resort, but it is there, in part, to put pressure on the industry. We make no apologies for that, but we expect the industry can and will deliver, and it has made it clear that it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that LIFA, ASFA and others are saying that this package is the way to go demonstrates the industry's belief that it is responsible for finding the solution to the problem of small superannuation contributions. The various seminars that we have had around the country in the last week or so have demonstrated that that process will be enhanced. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has been making it very clear that it is vigorously pressing on with the transfer protocol arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that needs to be said in this context is that superannuation needs to be seen as the long-term investment proposition that it is. Some examples were given during the second reading debate about concerns of investment returns. Certainly, I share a concern in that area, but it is wrong to take the short-term view on that debate, just as it is wrong to&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Connolly" NAMEID="QF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr Connolly</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go through figures when we have compared the performances of the banks. The opposition has been advocating that the banks have a different role in this arrangement. Before speaking on investment returns, I will make the point that people can go into banks today and buy a superannuation plan over the counter. They can also go into a credit union and buy the same arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we say quite clearly is that the approach to the deed and the separation from the direct on-line banking arrangements through balance sheets needs to be treated in the same way that a life office has to treat superannuation. There are very sound, prudential reasons for requiring that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate, the opposition continually made suggestions about the arrangements of retirement savings accounts and those sorts of things. The opposition's argument on that point was undercut by the fact that an opposition speaker in the debate referred to an example as having a poor return. This was the very same product&mdash;the bank superannuation product&mdash;that we had heard advocates say would be much better for competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at other areas of banking services, there is not too much evidence to show that the small end of town has been the priority of the banks in recent times. The small depositors in banks have not exactly felt that they have been getting a good deal out of banking services lately. I suggest that that is not the area of superannuation that the opposition is concerned about either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have repeatedly said to banks and credit unions, `If you set up the appropriate structure, apply the similar regime and prudential standards that apply to life offices, industry superannuation funds and others who operate superannuation arrangements, there will be no reason why you can't compete. But you should compete on the basis that you are dealing with the same supervisory standards.' It is important that they try to create a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about returns on investment issues and compare banks with superannuation funds. When contributing to the debate, some honourable members used the example of the last 12 months. Obviously, there has been a very disappointing superannuation fund return in the past year. That is starting to turn around, but we are clearly looking for better results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that, in the 12-month period to November 1993, the actual return on funds in the superannuation area was 28 per cent. A period that is longer than that would be hard to beat as far as other financial services are concerned. If we look at the average superannuation funds returned over the last five years, we will see that the average return was 9.5 per cent. For banks, the average return over that time was 7.3 per cent. I make the point that we have to look at this savings arrangement in a period that is broader than 12 months. The community needs to understand that it is for the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, we want to ensure the most competitive pressures we can. That is why the member protection arrangements, the transfer protocol and other things are important. We need to ensure that we do not get too caught up in the short-term view. Other countries are able to plan their savings for a longer period. We need to do so as well. The arrangements that were outlined last night&mdash;and which others have frequently referred to in the debate&mdash;demonstrate why it is important to resolve the small amounts issue and then move on to rebuild the confidence levels that are needed in superannuation. There is no doubt that the benefits that will flow from superannuation will be very real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some questions were raised in the debate about whether there would be direction of investments and issues of that sort. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) referred to the Australia Reconstructed document, a trade union contribution to the debate on this matter. There has been a lot of discussion about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In past debates, I have referred to the fact that, over the years, people on all sides of the parliament have talked about where money should be invested. The member for O'Connor said that, as far as he was concerned, superannuation funds were not investing in the right areas. You cannot have it both ways. We have to say to superannuation fund investors and the trustees who have the legal obligations for them that, first and foremost, they have to ensure they get the best financial return by exercising a proper and prudent responsibility on the investment. That is their obligation. The law makes that clear, and we are not walking away from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made that quite clear in the SIS legislation last year, and there is absolutely nothing in this package that changes the trustees' responsibilities. The retirement savings account would do the very opposite. It takes the responsibility away from the trustee arrangements that were outlined in SIS. So it does the very reverse to what some were seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to note in all of those arrangements is that there are obligations on the trustees. The clear obligations are to ensure a balanced investment portfolio. There is no doubt that fund members will continue to exercise an interest in how those funds are invested and, in terms of the accountability process, they will say that is precisely proper. The basis on which the trustees then develop their investment strategy is something they should report to members about and be accountable for. But we are not, as a government, saying that there should be a particular form for directed investments. We have resisted that, and we have no intention whatsoever in this package of changing those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear message from all of this is that the industry is going to provide the main solution to the small accounts problem. It has had the effect of diminishing the community's understanding of the value of superannuation. There is no doubt that, as far as superannuation arrangements are concerned, from the various research work we have done, people do appreciate the long-term benefits. They do appreciate that it is going to help maximise each Australian's retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with the reassurance that we will continue to see the social safety net, the pension wage safety net, as a key component of retirement incomes for decades to come. We all know that many people rely at least in part on that as well as on the social, health and other initiatives that flow from the part pension safety net. At the same time, these measures really ensure that women, part-time employees and those that did not get access to superannuation in the past do get part access to superannuation and part access to pension. As a result of all those measures, as the budget papers make clear, they are all looking forward to a higher retirement income because of the regime that is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all I need to say. This is a good package for addressing the fundamental problems that have been part of the superannuation arrangements. It now builds on the strength of the broader nine per cent contribution up to the year 2002, with the further measures flowing from the budget last night. I thank members for their contributions. I believe the package that has been outlined is the appropriate one for dealing with these issues. In commending the bills to the House, I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the bills. </PARA>

<PARA>The reason for our motion is, firstly, that we believe this act should be limited by a sunset clause to come into effect two years after the commencement of the act. We believe that, during that two-year period the Commissioner of Taxation, in consultation with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, should negotiate with the private sector for the purposes of establishing a range of new products defined as retirement savings accounts and that these accounts should be available through banks, building societies, credit unions, life offices, superannuation funds or any appropriate financial intermediary. The purpose of that proposal is to bring into the system a greater degree of choice for contributors and a greater degree of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is put forward in the belief that, as is set out in the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill, it is not necessary to utilise the ATO as the sole source of control for the investment of small accounts&mdash;that is, up to $1,000. It is a mechanism that could be applied through the private sector. Therefore, we believe that retirement savings accounts, or a generic series of products which fit that description, would be the most appropriate way to do it. It would mean that small accounts holders would be able to consolidate their accounts as is proposed in the bill, and rightly so, while at the same time having complete freedom of choice as to where they wish to invest their money. The money would be secure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in his previous explanation that there is a question of adequate protection and a question of the statutory obligations of trusteeship. I point out to the honourable gentleman that in Canada, where this proposition works perfectly adequately, retirement savings accounts, or, as I said, products which are generically within that context, are not subject to the same arrangements for trusteeship as apply to normal superannuation products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue in Australia to date has been that the life offices and superannuation funds believe that the banks would offer an unfair level of competition to them in the event that RSAs were accepted. It also follows that the ACTU does not want the RSAs either because it believes that would also bring in competition for the industry funds. Internationally this problem has been overcome by simply applying the rule that across the board, irrespective of which of those intermediaries is involved in selling these products, they must have a level playing field, they must be subject to the same arrangements. It does not follow that those arrangements have to be identical in trusteeship terms, as is currently applied to superannuation funds. As I said, that is the Canadian experience. By all rational judgment, it works perfectly satisfactorily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, I reiterate the government's opposition to the amendments that have been outlined by the shadow minister for superannuation and retirement incomes, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). We have made clear that we see the solution to the small amounts issues as being the three-tier package that I have outlined, member protection and also matters relating to the transfer protocol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the tax collection mechanism is concerned, we are not seeing it as a superannuation fund. So the suggestion that it become something like a superannuation fund with a RSA as equivalent is not what the mechanism is about. It is a mechanism for collection and then for the money to be transferred out as it aggregates up. So I do not think it is necessary to include the sort of proposition that is outlined in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that the package that has been outlined and the response that is coming forward from industry will deliver substantially on the solutions to these issues in line with the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) of 28 June last year. I think that is the appropriate way to evolve and conclude these issues. We do not need to do anything as far as changing the mixes is concerned at the moment. The current strategy is well supported by the life offices and by ASFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opposition is coming back to the position that the banks tried to run that they would somehow do better in superannuation than they have with small accounts in bank deposits and provide a better level of service there. I do not think that is a fair commentary on where things need to be at this stage. I think we should see the package developed and finalised and make sure it works well, and it will. Therefore, the proposal that has been outlined by the member for Bradfield is one that the government is not prepared to entertain at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of that act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977, a total of 59 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill would be to bring within the schedule to the land rights act that area of land which is the subject of the Western Desert repeat land claim. The Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and claimants in the land claim have entered into an agreement which settles that land claim. As part of that agreement, the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the land rights act to grant the claim area, excluding the Tanami Road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple. The government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which recognises both the agreement between the traditional owners of some of the land in the Western Desert area and the Northern Territory government under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the granting of that land to the traditional Aboriginal owners. The original Western Desert land claim covered substantial areas of land along the Western Australia-Northern Territory border. This original claim was heard by Mr Justice Olney, the then land commissioner, who presented his report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in September 1990. The commissioner recommended the grant of some of the area totalling 3,676 square kilometres, and in November 1991 this was handed over to the Mount Frederick Land Trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A repeat claim was subsequently lodged over remaining areas not recommended for grant. On 28 July 1994 the Central Land Council proposed, and the land commissioner agreed, that the repeat claim be split into two discrete parts and labelled north and south. The southern area came before the land commission in September 1994 for hearing in terms of section 50(2B) of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the hearing, the Northern Territory government investigated the settlement of the claim by negotiation. An offer was accepted by the Central Land Council on behalf of the claimants on 15 November last year. This in turn led to the signing of a formal agreement between the territory, the claimants and the Central Land Council on 23 November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The settlement has resulted from a cooperative approach by the territory, the Central Land Council and the traditional owners. The settlement avoided the need for a hearing and the associated expenses, and will result in the issue of title to the traditional owners&mdash;the Kartangarurru, Warlpiri and Walmajeri language groups&mdash;at an earlier time than would otherwise have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Desert north hearing is set down for August 1995. Without in any way prejudicing that hearing, I would like to wish the traditional owners of that area the very best in their land claims on the area. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, as I have said on a previous occasion on a similar bill which came before this House in March this year, was landmark legislation in land rights for Aboriginal people. Under this bill Aboriginal people now have almost 40 per cent of the territory with another nine per cent under claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further land is also owned by Aboriginal people through purchase under pastoral lease. This has caused some concern to the cattle industry in the Northern Territory because the industry feels it needs to be of a certain size to be viable. Under the act, land purchased can be put into inalienable title, in the same way as land granted under the act. Once the land goes into inalienable title, it then becomes very difficult for the Aboriginal owners to mortgage it. If the finances are not there or the will is not there to run it as a property, the property goes out of production. Because of this very fact, when the land bill came before this House the coalition put forward an amendment so that funds put through the land fund should go straight to the Indigenous Land Corporation and not through ATSIC, as land purchased by ATSIC could be converted to inalienable title. When we said to the government that that was one of our concerns, the government replied that we were making up these concerns and it should not be so. On November 1994 Senator Gareth Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has agreed with the Northern Territory government that the allocation of new moneys to the land fund should not lead to an increase in the amount of land claimed under the land rights act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not prepared to allow the potential for open slather on conversions to inalienable freehold prior to the cut-off for claims.</PARA>
<PARA>That still did not cover ATSIC, which, as I said, until 1997 can still buy land under inalienable freehold title. The matter was further canvassed by Senator Bob Collins. He was quite clear in rejecting the coalition amendment as one that was totally and utterly unnecessary. Senator Bob Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only fear that would then be raised, and I am prepared to bet large sums of money that this is not going to happen, is that the $21 million of ATSIC funds would be used&mdash;this is what Marshall Perron was referring to in terms of his reference to double dealing; and it is a nonsense scenario&mdash;exclusively or largely over the next three years to purchase land in the Northern Territory to the exclusion of everywhere else in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, if that were not clear enough:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am prepared to bet Senator Chamarette a huge sum of money&mdash;any sum she would like to name&mdash;that the prospect of ATSIC's land acquisition funds exclusively being devoted to land purchases in the Northern Territory is a highly unlikely scenario indeed.</PARA>
<PARA>He further went to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I confidently predict will happen is that the pattern of purchases by ATSIC over the next three years in the Northern Territory will continue very largely as it has since ATSIC was set up, because the same balance of power exists on the commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So said Senator Bob Collins. That was the basis of the government's argument in rejecting the coalition amendment. However, we find that since then ATSIC at its 34th meeting made a decision on its land acquisition and management program in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission pursuant to section 14 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 and Objectives 5, 6 and 7 of the Corporate Plan agreed to set aside $10m for land purchases in the Northern Territory and $2m for other priority national purchases in each of the next two years with the balance of funds to be allocated for land management.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sorry that Senator Chamarette did not take up Senator Bob Collins on his offer of the bet of any amount of money she would like to wager because, had she done so, she would be a very rich woman today. So much for the government's promises, guarantees and everything else. Like everything else, they really do not stand up to the test of time. In this case it has been less than a year&mdash;maybe only six months&mdash;which for the government is not a bad record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation with the land fund. There is little else I want to add at this time to this debate. This bill is very similar to one that came up in March. It is with great joy that the coalition sees the traditional owners who have maintained their links with the land and who have sacred sites on that land being able to enjoy that land in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make this point for a number of reasons, one of which is that this is one of the most isolated areas in the Northern Territory. Access to the claim area has been very difficult indeed. The previous application&mdash;this is a repeat claim&mdash;was dated 30 May 1980, which is 15 years ago. The struggle to achieve this claim has lasted 15 years, but we see it coming to fruition today with the scheduling of this land through this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 when research work for the previous claim began&mdash;the area is very remote, and access extremely difficult&mdash;it took six days of continuous bush driving to travel the 130 kilometres to the land claim area. I congratulate the people who worked so hard on the claim to make this claim a reality for the traditional owners. I want to make that point for two reasons, one of which is that I doubt whether anyone in this chamber, apart from me, has any comprehension at all of the area of land I am talking about or its isolation. When I say it took six days to travel 130 kilometres, you will look at me in disbelief, as most people would. But the nature of this land is such that it has previously been very inaccessible by motor vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago when I was working in the Central Land Council I had the privilege of travelling around the Lake Mackay area with the then member for Melbourne, Mr Hand, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and visited some Pintubi people&mdash;a group of people who had not had any contact with non-Aboriginal communities, with white civilisation, in any meaningful way. I met these people in 1985. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot of that country around there is prospecting country, and I will come to that again in a moment. The point of this is that this country, from a non-Aboriginal perspective, would be seen as relatively worthless. It is barren, there is little water, it is very sandy and it is difficult to access. The traditional owners instructed the land council, their lawyers and anthropologists to pursue a claim. The people who pursued the claim on behalf of the traditional owners I think deserve a great deal of praise. They are very professional people, very committed people, but people who have often been vilified. I say that because I can recall that in the late 1970s professional non-Aboriginal staff, anthropologists, were shot at in the Tanami region by fundamentally racist people who did not want to recognise the legitimate rights of Aboriginals to claim land under the land rights act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment which is shown by the traditional owners, their force of will to establish a claim in the first place, needs professional help and assistance to ensure that it can negotiate the processes of government which are regulated by this legislation, to take it to a formal hearing where submissions are heard and to negotiate with perhaps mining companies, the Northern Territory government or whomever. The process from the original application for the land in 1980 has taken 15 years&mdash;15 years. It is not land, as I have tried to point out, which has high material value for non-Aboriginal people but in a physical sense, in a symbolic sense, in a very sacred sense and in a spiritual sense it has great significance for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the federal government, a Labor government, supported the aspirations of the traditional owners and provided funding to purchase what was Mongrel Downs but is now called the Tanami Downs property. The effect of this purchase was to at last open up access to Aboriginal people which enabled them to successfully make the claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before 1989 the claimants had to contest with hostile behaviour from the previous manager of the Tanami Downs pastoral lease. This previous manager had a reputation for refusing access to land by land council staff and Aboriginal people. The manager's reputation was so bad that Aboriginal people were frightened to go near the place for fear of physical retribution. I have mentioned there were gunshots&mdash;they did not involve this particular person&mdash;in the late 1970s, and here we had in the 1980s, just a decade ago, people fearful of exercising their rights because of physical retribution from a manager of a pastoral lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These non-Aboriginal people who work for these Aboriginal organisations and do it so willingly and so professionally have, as I have said, been vilified. The lawyers, the anthropologists and the advisers who worked for the Central Land Council have been attacked by successive CLP governments and opposition members of this parliament. They make a habit of it. That they should take such an antagonistic position of course reinforces the attitudes of other non-Aboriginal people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have experienced this myself. Some years ago when I was working as a senior adviser at the Central Land Council I was travelling back from a land council meeting at Daguragu. I was travelling with a very good friend of mine who was then the senior lawyer of the Central Land Council. We stopped at a roadside inn. At that roadside inn we were refused service. We were refused service because we worked for a black organisation. This was not a decade ago. This was Australia in the 1980s. This is an attitude which has been reinforced traditionally and historically by successive CLP governments in the Northern Territory and which, I might say, has not changed. Despite the rhetoric, it is one attitude which has not changed, and I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory government, the CLP, has historically opposed this land claim process. We have heard, and as the shadow minister said, it is opposed to Aboriginal people purchasing pastoral leases for fear that somehow or other the land will dematerialise, that it will no longer be there&mdash;it will be shifted. The day the traditional owners at Uluru and Katat-juta, Ayers Rock, were handed back the title of their country in 1985, the then Chairman of the Pitjantjatjara Council, Yami Lester, said, after being attacked by the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory CLP, Ian Tuxworth, `Can't you see? We haven't shifted it. It is still here. Ayers Rock is still here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Aboriginal people, when they get hold of this country, do so for a number of purposes&mdash;in this particular case because of their spiritual affiliation, their traditional affiliation, to this country, which is of primary importance. What is significant about this is that, as we have led up to this day, it has involved significant discussions with mining interests who are involved in the area. Before agreeing to the grant, the Northern Territory government sought the views of mining companies with interests in the area of the grant&mdash;North Flinders Mines Ltd, Otter Exploration, Zapopan and Acacia Resources Ltd. None of them objected to the grant. Indeed, it is worth noting the attitude of a couple of these companies. North Flinders Mines Ltd, in a letter dated 21 October 1994, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act is however known to NFM and we have a history of successful negotiation with the Central Land Council and traditional land owners under that Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Otter Exploration, in a letter dated 28 October 1994, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Otter Exploration had been a very active explorer in the Tanami Desert on both sides of the border for the past 6 years and we have developed a close association with the Traditional Owners that have title to much of the general area that surrounds the Land Claim area. We have accepted Aboriginal ownership without question during that period and we consider that our company is one of the pioneering mining companies in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>They are important statements. If you were to believe the rhetoric and propaganda which has traditionally and historically come from the Northern Territory government, you would believe that mining companies were opposed to the land rights act, could not work with Aboriginal people and were unprepared to negotiate with them. That, of course, is all baloney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is true is that the Northern Territory government has sought to frustrate the negotiations between Aboriginal people and mining companies to the extent of taking negotiated outcomes to the Supreme Court to nullify them. It argued&mdash;successfully before the courts, as it turns out&mdash;that Aboriginal people and mining companies could not sign disjunctive agreements under this act. Never mind the free market; never mind the rights of people to negotiate with one another or their interest to negotiate with one another. The Northern Territory CLP government has taken the view that it will actively prevent, interfere with or intervene in the negotiations which might take place between Aboriginal people and mining companies to the extent that it does not agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl: do you think that is a reasonable way to operate? You, being a fair person, I am sure would say no. I would ask the shadow minister, who is no longer in the chamber, what her attitude to that is. Perhaps she could ask her CLP opponents, including the CLP senator from the Northern Territory who sits with your party in the Senate, why they are adopting this attitude; why they are not fostering a productive relationship to see the settlement of negotiations and agreements and give country access for mining purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, though, on behalf of the traditional owners I want to congratulate both the Central Land Council and the Northern Territory government for finally&mdash;in terms of the Northern Territory government&mdash;taking an expedient and cooperative approach to the settlement of this claim. Most importantly, the settlement of the claim will enable a title handover to take place while many of the older traditional owners are alive. That is important. What has happened historically is that these claims have been frustrated. Some of these land claims have been outstanding since 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular land claim case I can think of, the Kenbi land claim, is still ongoing. It has been taken to the Federal Court and the full High Court by the Northern Territory government&mdash;and it has lost on each occasion, of course. But it has sought to frustrate the land claim process and stop the land being transferred to the traditional Aboriginal owners. And, of course, people die during the process. Traditional owners die, so they never get the benefit of this land. Although their traditional attachment is often recognised and acknowledged, even by the Northern Territory government, it seeks to stop and frustrate the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a comment on the remarks that have been made by an erstwhile, it seems, pretender to the Chief Minister's throne in the Northern Territory. I noted particularly the remarks by the shadow minister in talking about this piece of legislation being historical or landmark  legislation in terms of land rights. There is no doubt about that. It was passed by a previous conservative administration, the Fraser government&mdash;albeit that it advanced a draft bill which had been prepared by the Whitlam government. Nevertheless, to its credit, the Fraser government passed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that what I am hearing from the opposition is that it supports the act. There are two things about that that I will come to. If it does support the act, perhaps it could tell the Northern Territory government. Perhaps it could tell Senator Grant Tambling that it supports the act and that he should support the act as well. In the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 6 October 1994 the erstwhile pretender to the Chief Minister's throne, Shane Stone, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article made some reference to the fact that, if Canberra were to get its boot off our throat and get rid of absurd policies, like the 3-mine policy and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act</EMPHASIS> overlaid by the Mabo legislation, we could proceed with the business of making a dollar, paying our taxes and paying our way.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very different view from the one I hear being expressed&mdash;and I hope it is an honest representation of the shadow minister's view&mdash;by the shadow minister. So there is a dichotomy between the position being adopted by the opposition and by the CLP senator from the Northern Territory and his CLP counterparts in the Northern Territory government who have historically opposed the land rights act. They have made no bones about it. They have fought elections on it. They have sought to divide the Northern Territory community on the basis of race time and time again because of this act. That is to their shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the shadow minister tonight making some fairly disparaging remarks about the right of ATSIC to make determinations about how it spends its money.

It has made a decision about how funding will be appropriately distributed. That appears to be of some concern to the opposition because it does not like the nature of the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the opposition that last week ATSIC purchased a pastoral lease in the Northern Territory to the value of $2.9 million&mdash;Balbirini station near Borroloola. What you have to understand in this debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that pastoralists are jumping over themselves to sell their land to Aboriginal people. It is clear that there is no shortage of sellers of pastoral leases in the Northern Territory, and they want to sell to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet somehow or other it is a crime that Aboriginal people should want to purchase land, operate it as a pastoral lease, or transfer the title through the land claim process to enable them to have freehold title under the land rights act. That is not a crime; that is a right that exists under this legislation, which we understand the opposition supports. Either the opposition understands the legislation and supports it, or it does not. Either it accepts the right of ATSIC to make decisions and be self-determining, or it does not.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak briefly in this debate simply because I am distressed by the way in which the government continues to ignore the needs of the Aboriginal people and by the remarks made by the member for the Northern Territory regarding the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The commission's decision to spend all of its budget in the Northern Territory distresses me also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a representative process, and from comments made by previous members of the government, it was my understanding that this government would not permit funds to be allocated or corralled into one region of Australia but that there would be some form of equitable treatment even though Sydney and Melbourne could control the expenditure of the total federal budget in our system of government within Australia's requirement for all regions to receive appropriate attention. That was my understanding as to how the ATSIC budget was supposed to be expended, and it was my understanding that that was the guarantee given by the federal government. That has been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our spokesperson, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), drew the attention of the chamber to those features by saying nothing more than, `The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission spent money that way; why is that so?' I thought it was either an undertaking that the commission was not allowed to do that or an understanding that it would pay attention to each region of Australia, including the Northern Territory and New South Wales, and use the money to manage and administer the land that it owns. That has been ignored. Our spokesperson is doing nothing more than raising those factors to the attention of the House and the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back to the substance of the legislation and my concerns. I have read a description of this land, which was kindly provided by the library. It is harsh land covered by small bushes and spinifex. It is typical of the Tanami Desert area. The income and livelihood that could be earned from that area is negligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition objects to the inalienable freehold rights which give title for an indefinite period, forever, to Aboriginal groups and allow them to do nothing with the land. The government is supplying them with land. Spinifex, sand and small bushes do a great deal for Aboriginal health, Aboriginal education and job opportunities amongst the Aboriginal people. They are the three basic and most important needs expressed time and time again in this chamber through reports of the parliament and expert bodies. Professor Fred Hollows was classic in saying to all Australians, `Attend to the real needs of the Aboriginal people.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here again we have legislation before the House handing spinifex, sand and small bushes to a group of Aboriginal people. Big deal! I call on the government to pay greater attention to their real needs. We are supposed to have had a reconciliation process. We are supposed to have settled the Mabo issue. We are supposed to have a social package of health and other things which have not yet surfaced. How much money is involved? What is the project, plan and objectives of the government? We have not heard. The Australian people have not heard what the government's intentions are in regard to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am deeply disappointed that time and again in this place there is chest beating by members of the government as though providing spinifex, sand and small bushes is of real benefit to the Aboriginal people. You have not even made a start yet. Report after report tells us that, in your 12 years as a government, the wellbeing of the Aboriginal people has declined, the health standards have declined, the educational standards have declined and job availability has declined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the government to express its concern for the Aboriginal people by doing something that is of immeasurable benefit to them instead of making claims that giving them spinifex, sand and small bushes is a real alternative. One of the things the coalition has said is that, in order to give the Aboriginal people the proper dignity they deserve instead of the patronage which is exhibited by the member for the Northern Territory, we need to trust them to use their land properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposal is to give them the land and let them raise funds by mortgaging it. Let them do things with it that other members of the Australian community can do with it. Why do we have to lock it up with them forever and say, `You can't raise funds against it. You can't raise a mortgage. You can't improve your lifestyle. You can't buy cattle using it as some sort of equity. You can't make improvements to fences. You can't build schools.' They cannot do anything with that land except sit on it because of the weird title this government thinks it should give that land&mdash;that is, inalienable freehold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that, by process of patronage and do-gooder attitudes, the federal government cannot trust the Aboriginal people to take up title to land in the way in which every other Australian is entitled. It has to lock that group, clan or family up with the land forever. It does not matter whether the people move to Melbourne, Brisbane or Sydney. It does not matter whether they live on the land or not. It does not matter whether there are feral animals on the land. It does not matter whether there are wild cattle on the land, whether the fences fall down, whether people build fences, or whether they build yards and run fine herds of cattle. It is all the same because it is theirs forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No other Australian is subject to that process, but it is so limiting to the Aboriginal people. It limits them to sitting under the bushes in the sand and the spinifex, basically unattended to. They are not able to raise funds to take care of their own health needs, to start work projects, because they cannot borrow a small amount of money against their land or make improvements which would assist them in running the cattle or the property in a commercial sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with the shadow minister, who has also expressed this concern, and appeal to members of the government that we as a nation and they as a political party need to pay attention to the real needs of the Aboriginal people. I am delighted that the shadow minister has joined us this evening and strongly supports the intentions that are expressed by the government but are so poorly executed. The government is failing to trust the Aboriginal people and is failing to give some measure of leadership to ATSIC. I hope that the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who will speak after me, will pay some attention to my words and take up the real need of the Aboriginal people with the Australian Labor Party, the government. </PARA>

The nation stopped and said, `Here's Richo out in the middle of Australia worried about the Aboriginals.' We thought something was actually going to happen from that point on, but nothing did. It was evidently regarded in the Labor Party as a Richo stunt to promote himself so they all ignored it. The fact is that he put his finger on some really sensitive issues and nothing was done about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), who is at the table, that I have listened to Fred Hollows a number of times. He used to bag the Australian Labor Party uphill and down dale for being useless and full of words and light on action. He was not very complimentary about the Liberal Party either, but he said that Fraser and Chaney had some good ideas that the Labor Party should have followed through. He also said that he was deeply disappointed with the talk about land rights coming from the Australian Labor Party when blindness and disease were rife throughout the Aboriginal community. It is disappointing that the minister at the table is smiling about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I impress on the government that most Aboriginals in the Northern Territory and other parts of Australia do not support the views of the trumped up leaders of the Aboriginal people who are involved in the political process and who are mates of the Labor Party and supporters of the law firms in Melbourne.

The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was going to make the big difference to the Aboriginal portfolio, but he found that the lawyers had this issue very much in their grip.

However, since that time, a great understanding of the additional ownership of the area has been gained by the Central Land Council. This was done by gaining better access to the more sacred sites previously unknown in the original claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the views of mining companies with interests in the area were sought by the Northern Territory government. The companies included Flinders Mines Ltd, Otter Exploration NL, Zappopan NL and Acacia Resources Ltd. None of them objected to the grant. The views of the relevant Aboriginal groups have also been sought on this matter. That is essential to any good legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major benefit of this bill will be to free up this land for traditional owners. By bringing it under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commission will be necessary, saving all parties concerned a lot of time and money. That is another important point. As a result, the Aboriginal people concerned will be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands. It is their country and they will always relate to it. In addition, this arrangement will ensure the land is handed back while the elderly traditional owners are still alive. That is something which they understandably place great emphasis on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has a history in land claims of attacking grants such as these. In particular, some members of the opposition have criticised the purchase of cattle stations which will be run by Aboriginal interests. In answer to this, I would merely say that the policy allowing a limited number of Northern Territory cattle stations dates back to 1973 when the first properties were actually purchased. These properties continue to be operated as successful commercial cattle enterprises, as do the majority of those purchased since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these purchases, hundreds of Aboriginal people benefit in the areas of employment and wealth creation, which can be seen only as a good thing because it will improve their lifestyle. In addition, in the case of Hodgson Downs, which has a large number of sacred sites, control of the station by its traditional owners enables more effective protection of Aboriginal culture and heritage areas. This is crucial if we are to protect the culture and heritage of our Aboriginal people. It is very important to have the opportunity to see the commitment and awareness of our indigenous people to protecting their culture and heritage and what it means for Australia. It will certainly make Australia a greater place if we address all these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability to move towards the enjoyment of their traditional lands while providing self-sustaining employment is a big step in terms of quality of life for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is something that we should be proud to be pursuing. Their quality of life is intricately woven into the access to the land and sea areas, and measures to improve this are welcome and essential. Belonging to the land is important to the indigenous people of this country and it is something that we should be counted on to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like anyone else, quality of life for Aboriginal people is also linked to those other factors that determine it for you and me, such as health, housing, employment and education. The member for Mitchell rightly pointed this out. We also have to recognise the importance of land to our indigenous people. We cannot throw these other things together without getting to the real issues that are of major concern to indigenous people&mdash;that is, the importance of their culture and belonging to the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures announced in last night's budget address these very important issues. I do not think anyone in this place would say that they are not. The government is responding to the health problems facing indigenous people. There are some issues that really need to be addressed and they were announced last night. It is important that we acknowledge their importance when addressing the issue of the right of our indigenous people to their land. When we talk about these issues to people in our electorates, we as members of parliament have a responsibility to explain what the issues are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gone are the days when we tolerated the racist attitudes of people. It falls on the shoulders of us all to explain to people in our community what it means and how important it is that we protect the heritage and culture of our Aboriginal people. Bills like this one before us go a long way to doing that. I think that is important. Unless we on both sides of this House can work together on these issues, we will never achieve a true spirit of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently attended a meeting in my own electorate where the issue of law and order arose. This issue is raised regularly in many places; it is not restricted to my electorate by any means. But the person who raised this issue did not even mention Aboriginal people. However, in the end the debate focused on the fact that Aboriginal people seem to have got the blame. I was very sad at the response of the people, whom I would have thought were leading citizens in the community, at this particular meeting. These people were putting the blame on Aboriginal people for any crime in the area. It was interesting to hear their response and how the media picked up on it. I have to give credit to the media. They were rather supportive of the stance I took in defending the problems facing Aboriginal people. I make the point that it is not the Aboriginal people's problem; it is our problem.

I must confess that when speaking to him I unfortunately referred to the `Aboriginal problem'. He said to me, `It's not the Aboriginal problem; it's your problem.' He was exactly right. I explained to these people at the meeting what Neville had said on that occasion. I said, `He's right. How many of us sitting around this table employ Aboriginal people, invite them into our homes for a cup of tea and things like that? If we go to church on Sunday, are other Aboriginal people sitting next to us? Do we put our hand out and communicate with them? We don't in a lot of cases.'

He is very committed to the process of reconciliation, as are a lot of other members of that committee who have similar backgrounds and political views as he does. But we have to turn this situation around. We have to be prepared to go out and explain to people in a genuine manner what these bills are about. We need to emphasise the importance of the land and this country to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I call on members of this place to explain those things in a very genuine manner. Until such time as we in this place do that, we will not be able to address the other very serious issues which were raised by the honourable member for Mitchell&mdash;the areas of health and education. Those structures need to be there in order for that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All levels of government, including our state and local governments, have a responsibility to recognise the importance of the land and this country to Aboriginal people and the important contribution that they make to our nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and I both serve on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We clearly have a number of common goals, although we may occasionally disagree on the way that we are going to try to get there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular piece of legislation is quite short. The explanatory memorandum tells us that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977, some 59 parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment arises from a settlement agreement reached between the Northern Territory government, the claimants&mdash;the Western Desert (South) Repeat Land Claim&mdash;and the Central Land Council. The agreement includes a clause in which the Northern Territory government agrees to request the Commonwealth to effect the grant of an estate in fee simple in the land which was subject to this particular land claim. It is a very brief and straightforward bill. Everybody agrees that it should go through. It is a practical measure which is part of the daily business of government. As has already been said, the coalition supports this particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be worth looking behind some of the issues that this legislation represents. What lies behind the bill is the subject of land and its importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There may be those in the community who would say, `Well, in the last year or two we've heard an awful lot about Aboriginal land. We've had the Mabo decision and all the rather divisive debate that followed from that, including the native title legislation.' One would have to say that a number of the hopes and aspirations that were laid at the door of the Native Title Tribunal have not really been realised to date, although we are now some 18 months into its operation. Justice French, who heads that tribunal, is already making recommendations to government to change the nature of that legislation. We have had the indigenous land fund legislation, which has also been the subject of much political comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is land a major issue to the indigenous people in this country; it has also been high on the political agenda of the rest of the nation. The particular piece of legislation we are talking about today&mdash;the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976&mdash;is at the very core of land issues in the Northern Territory. It was in place long before Mabo and the native title legislation were even dreamt about. It has been in place for the best part of 20 years. It was passed by a Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that legislation, about half the land in the Northern Territory is now under Aboriginal control. I was in the Northern Territory just prior to and over Easter with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs during our inquiry into a number of aspects. It gave me the opportunity to see first-hand what was going on in the Northern Territory in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has placed&mdash;in my view quite rightly in principle&mdash;great emphasis on land, because it is important to Aboriginal people. Why is land so important to Aboriginal people? The message I get is that it is all about gaining self-respect, which comes through the control of one's own environment and one's own land. Most of the community can identify with the pride of ownership and the self-respect that comes from owning property or land. That is a fundamental issue for most of the indigenous people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my five years in this place, I have been fortunate enough to be a member of the House of Representatives committee and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. For a year or so I was also the shadow minister. This has given me the opportunity to travel extensively and to talk to many indigenous communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Aboriginal people have a very great sense of belonging to particular parcels of land. Many have been forcibly moved and links with the land have been broken. Many in our community would argue that non-Aboriginal people also have a strong attachment to the land. I have talked to many indigenous communities and cannot help but be impressed by the fact that they have an attachment to the land which is more spiritual, if you like, than any other word that I can think of; it is not an attachment in quite the same way as perhaps Europeans have an attachment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is also a fundamental cultural difference between indigenous people and the broader community in the way that land is used. That is not to say that there is not a lot of common ground there. Many Aboriginal communities will use land in the same way that you or I or other members of the wider community might use land. Often the ownership and occupation of land is not there to be used in a Western commercial sense. It is merely being attached to that ancestral land that is fundamentally important to the self-respect, self-esteem and motivation to try to do something better with one's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I believe, and I think most Aboriginal people believe, that whether you like it or not you have to deal with the subject of land because it is at the core of dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage in this country. By whatever statistics one cares to measure it, most of the Aboriginal community&mdash;not all but many&mdash;are very much in a state of disadvantage compared with the rest of the community. We go through these statistics regularly but it does not hurt to remind ourselves from time to time that that disadvantage is very real. For the people who are suffering and who have that disadvantage it is a daily problem that just does not go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my concerns is that, whilst the government may well have had the intention of dealing with issues like land which are fundamental, in the last decade or so the government has not dealt adequately with a number of other elements of disadvantage that should flow on from the subject of dealing with land. It is not sufficient just to give land. Under the Northern Territory land rights concept or under the native title concept or under the land fund concept there are other things the government should be doing for our indigenous population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at the health situation, for example, of indigenous people. If you look at the statistics produced by the ABS, an unimpeachable source, the statistics are all bad. You can go to an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, as I have done on a number of occasions and as I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have done on a number of occasions, and you will see six-week old babies with lung infections because there is no fundamental preventative health care in many Aboriginal communities. When you have a six-week old baby who has a lung infection the result of that comes out in later life, in pneumonia or other illnesses. It is a contributing factor, along with a number of other factors, to people dying at an earlier age than those in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My daughter is about to produce a new baby around August and it could well be a male baby. That male baby will have an 18-year better life expectancy than an Aboriginal male baby born at the same time. If it were a female baby it would be a 15-year difference. Some of those differences are to do with the fact that basic preventative health is not there. The education, the health measures, the nursing assistance, or whatever you like to call it, are not there on the ground to help with infections early in life. Those infections come back to haunt people later in life and cause early death. I would have hoped that in the last 12 years we would have seen much more action from the government to deal with some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been particularly sad in the health area&mdash;as opposed to the issue of land, which is emotive and high profile and on which we get all the government's rhetoric&mdash;is that people like Graham Richardson as the minister went up north and discovered Aboriginal health, which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I have both known about for a long time. Yet nothing has really been done by way of substantive measures. Even in the budget last night there was a bit of extra funding, about $50 million a year as I understand it, and a transfer of responsibility for Aboriginal health to the Department of Human Services and Health from ATSIC. But before it went to ATSIC it was with the Department of Health anyway and problems were not dealt with. There are things in that area that your government, Mr Deputy Speaker, needs to give attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eye infections received great publicity from Professor Fred Hollows and subsequent people in his organisation. In many Aboriginal communities 50 per cent of the children still, in 1995, have a middle ear infection, which is not only a health problem but a matter which affects their education, which affects their ability to get a job, which affects their chances throughout the rest of their life. There are diet problems and a whole range of areas where simple preventative measures could help with Aboriginal health. So it is not sufficient just to talk about land. You have to deal with those other things too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can talk about housing disadvantage. I have said in this place before that I remember a couple of years ago going to a community called Maningrida, on the north coast of Arnhem Land. You can look at the beach and there is the blue sea and the sand and it is beautiful and wonderful, ideal holiday resort country. Of the 2,000 or so people who live there, the average number of people to a three-bedroom house is 38. There are fewer than 38 people in this chamber at the moment&mdash;not only members but also staff and attendants and a handful of people in the public gallery. Just imagine the people in this chamber at the moment trying to live in a three-bedroom house with one toilet and one shower. Within a few months we would be at each other's throats and we would be breaking the place up&mdash;the young bucks, the newly marrieds, the old grandparents and so on and so forth. The overcrowding and the standard of housing is totally unacceptable. In Western Australia the view, from talking to Homeswest, is very clear. We provide in the hot, remote parts of Australia for the Aboriginal communities standard three-bedroom houses as are built in Perth, which are totally inappropriate for the indigenous community and not what is wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the education of Aboriginal people, again we are not just talking about the importance of land. Land is important, but you have to supplement it with other things. The drop-out rate in Aboriginal communities from schooling is quite appalling. Over Easter I went with the House of Representatives committee to a number of communities in the Northern Territory, at Alice Springs, at Santa Theresa, at Yuendumu, up to Darwin, out to Kakadu and down to Katherine and other places and the drop-out rate in those areas was absolutely phenomenal. Less than 50 per cent moved on from primary standard to secondary standard and you were lucky if you got a couple of kids out of several hundred who might make it through to year 12. Unless we fix that education problem for Aboriginal people you will never fix the rest of the problems. Then you can talk about employment. Aboriginal people generally in this country suffer appalling levels of unemployment even in good times. I will not spend a lot of time now talking about how the government mishandles the economy and the problems with unemployment and so on, but the reality is that even in good times of employment Aboriginal communities have high levels of unemployment. It is not unusual for it to be 50, 60, 70 or 80 per cent, even in the good times. Part of that is because they are in remote locations and jobs do not exist. Those problems have to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we get on to the area of substance abuse. Why is the government not prepared to do more in the area of substance abuse? Why is it only land that we hear all the rhetoric about? It is nice and easy for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to talk about dispossession and the terrible things that Europeans might have done. There is no argument about the history and substance. But the reality is that today's problems require more than rhetoric from the Prime Minister; they require some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone to places like the Pitjantjatjara lands in the north of South Australia and seen four-year-old kids sniffing petrol. I saw that two years ago and came back and talked to ATSIC; I talked to the chief executive of ATSIC and to the minister and said, `Let's do something about it.' And yet just as recently as April, this last month, I have gone out to communities again&mdash;and the same thing is still going on. There is no crisis action, no task force, no urgency from the government to fix those problems. It goes on and the government lets it go on. So it is not only land we should be talking about; there are other issues we need to be talking about too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we talk about the justice system. We have had of course the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Out of that came 339 recommendations, of which the government accepted 338. We have a report tabled in this place every year from all the states and the federal parliament explaining the bureaucratic action that government has taken to implement those recommendations. But the reality is that the indigenous population is still overrepresented in the gaol system. In some states, if you are a 15- to 19-year-old Aboriginal youth, you still have a 50 per cent better chance of being in gaol than if you come from the wider community. It seems to me that, whilst control and ownership of land is one key to self-respect and self-esteem and getting back on your feet, the government has a wider responsibility to deal with a number of other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to restore self-worth, pride and motivation in Aboriginal people&mdash;and the occupation of land is critical to that. That is why this bill is important. But it is part of an overall framework. We need the government now to act, not just to talk, in all of those areas of health and so on that I have just talked about. I would have to say that what was in the budget last night was minimal&mdash;I repeat, minimal&mdash;in those respects. ATSIC itself&mdash;the government's own body, that which this government set up to represent Aboriginal people&mdash;was critical this morning of the attitude that the government has taken in these areas, the funding that has been provided, the mechanisms that are being dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it would not be fair and balanced to stand in this place and only bring out the bad news. One of the reasons that bad relationships often exist between indigenous and non-indigenous people in this country is that quite often all you hear about is the bad news. But there are some good stories which showthat, if you do it right, you can in fact help the indigenous people in this country. That is why it is so important that the government give some more effort to helping the indigenous community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Easter trip with the committee we went, for example, to Kakadu; we went to the national park where, of course, Aboriginal people have ownership and are involved in the management. There also is some employment&mdash;not enough, but some. That is an extremely successful operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went on to Oenpelli which, I have to say, was a singular challenge. I think it is often well worth while for people who come from the suburbs of the big cities&mdash;and I come from the suburbs of a big city, of course, in Melbourne&mdash;to be told of some of the rigours experienced to get to small communities. We were going to Oenpelli, which is a 15- or 20-minute drive from Jabiru in the Kakadu National Park&mdash;except that, of course, they have just had the biggest wet up there for many a long day: the river crossing that normally would be gone across was 2.8 metres under water. So we did not exactly drive across but had to get a plane and fly for nine minutes across to the other side. At Oenpelli they have a very successful arts operation. They are selling not only across the country but also internationally. But the reality is that the scheme would not survive without government subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went down to Eva Valley, 150 miles south of Katherine. A major tourism activity is under way there. They have put in caravan sites, separate from the community, where tourists can go. They bring in international coach loads of tourists and are starting to lay the foundation for becoming economically independent. At Katherine Gorge, of course, the Aboriginal people are heavily involved in that activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lessons, it seems to me, are that we can improve the lot of Aboriginal people. This particular piece of legislation shows that it is best done in cooperation with the states. The next federal government, which will be a coalition government, is committed to working with the states to make sure that, in a practical sense as well as just in the rhetoric, we actually improve the lot of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular, to forget some of the rhetoric, forget some of the grandstanding and get on with the practical solutions for the many problems faced by our indigenous people&mdash;and to do so in a very sensible and practical way, in the way that the Liberal Party introduced this legislation and will conduct itself when it is next in government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to highlight some of the dangers faced by Australians travelling to destinations overseas. In some instances, one problem in particular is: who generally gets believed when an incident takes place? To preface my remarks, however, I must make it absolutely clear that I intend in no way to diminish the tourist potential of the destination in question. In general, particularly in the South-East Asian region, some of the countries are beautiful and exotic, with friendly and courteous staff. In most cases, they are wonderful places for Australians to go when a week or two of relaxation is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, like all countries, there are potential pitfalls. Nothing will ever eradicate these problems. My comments tonight are designed to highlight the need for better processes to combat problems when they occur. In doing so, I want to highlight the case of a respected member of the Western Australian police force who visited an international standard hotel in Bangkok last year. Mr Troy Vine of Kallaroo had been in Bangkok for only one night when he was bashed and robbed by people whom he alleges were security guards at the hotel at which he was staying. This hotel was the Indra Regent Hotel in Bangkok. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Vine claims he was attending a bar in the hotel on the second night he was in Bangkok when he was confronted by up to seven men who dragged him into a car park underneath the hotel and repeatedly hit him with batons they were carrying. Earlier he had escorted his sister with whom he was dining to his own room in the hotel and returned to the bar for a further drink. At the time Mr Vine thought his attackers were police officers but later discovered they were security personnel. After repeated bashing, Mr Vine escaped his captors and ran from the hotel to seek refuge in hiding nearby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Vine's situation is all the more serious because, apart from the hotel's blanket denial that anything occurred, Mr Vine was in the company of his sister at the time of the incident. She was forced to hide in his room and endure several instances where security guards attempted to smash through the door and into the room in search of Mr Vine. During these incidents the security men repeatedly claimed that Mr Vine had stolen the passport of another guest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Miss Vine lives in Bangkok, the whole incident is magnified in its sinister implications. She has received several anonymous phone calls since the incident, and the only way anyone could have obtained her number is from the wallet Mr Vine claims was stolen when he was bashed. He also lost money, a watch and other possessions in the attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Mr Vine is fearful for his sister's safety now that he is back in Australia. He is concerned now, after having obtained additional information, that the attack on him was really undertaken to prevent him from returning to his room where, as I have mentioned, he had left his sister earlier in the evening, so the attackers could gain access to her. This is an extremely worrying prospect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the bashing Mr Vine attended the Australian Federal Police office at the Australian Embassy in Bangkok and the local head of that office confirmed his injuries and advised him to take further action once he had returned to Australia to avoid inflaming the situation and thereby further jeopardising the safety of his sister. Mr Vine spent the remainder of his week-long holiday hiding in accommodation found for him by his sister. He certainly could not have returned to the Indra Regent Hotel to occupy the room he had already paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On returning to Australia, Mr Vine began corresponding with his travel agent and the hotel itself in an effort to have the matter investigated and to claim reimbursement of the room tariff&mdash;six nights&mdash;that he had not been able to enjoy as a result of the incident. Mr Vine has not had much joy or help from the management of the Indra Regent Hotel. In fact, after initially responding in a conciliatory manner, the further Mr Vine took his case, the more responses he received from the Indra Regent containing aspersions on him personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, after not having mentioned such in either of the first two letters to him, the manager of the Regent in a third letter accused Mr Vine of being intoxicated and abusive on the night in question. In fact, the tourist police of the tourism authority of Thailand took up the same theme when they investigated the incident some six months later. They also claim Mr Vine snatched the passport of another hotel customer and fled from the hotel to another location where the bashing occurred to stop Mr Vine before someone was harmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is suggesting that all Australians visiting Bangkok are always well-behaved and that none of them get drunk and indulge in stupid incidents while under the influence. Nothing, obviously, could be further from the truth. The poor behaviour of some visitors to Thailand and other Asian destinations is legion. It is certainly testament to the forbearance and understanding of the Thai people that they still welcome visitors so warmly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of my comments tonight is that it all seems to fall apart when a visitor attempts to have an incident investigated impartially. A veritable wall of silence seems to obscure what happens on a particular occasion. In Mr Vine's case, it would appear that he has no way of proving his claims. The hotel management still claims that the incident took place away from their premises. They also claim that none of their security personnel carry weapons of any type&mdash;including batons&mdash;and the local tourist police force simply believes everything the hotel management tells it. </PARA>

My heart is heavy because it would appear that the Labor Party is about to lose one of its sons to the team on the other side of the House. I refer to the dapper doctor, Dr Brendan Nelson, in the preselection contest for the seat of Bradfield. I would like to wish him very well in his attempt to win preselection over the current member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). I think the preselection is on Saturday. I know the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), who is sitting on the other side of the House, has a very deep and abiding interest in these preselection battles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there comes a time in the life and career of a young player when he seeks a new opportunity&mdash;a new field on which to play and extend his talents&mdash;and far be it from anybody on this side of the House to deny the dapper doctor this important opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doctor in the House, but there could be. We are quite prepared to provide members opposite with a list of a person's attributes along with a few comments on them. It would be confidential, of course. Such a list would canvass things such as loyalty, commitment, articulation on the field and stamina for the cause. It is very important that the Liberal Party understand these attributes and know the players it is getting. We on this side of the House would never stand in the way of a young player who feels that he or she has the opportunity to make a new career with a new team. We certainly wish the dapper doctor all the best in the preselection battle in Bradfield.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ought to say that members on this side of the House bear the member for Bradfield no animosity. He is a well-respected member of this House. He is known for his commitment and loyalty to the Liberal Party for the past 20 years. Even so, we live in a political and economic system that offers consumers a wide variety of choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has just brought down its national competition policy. One could say that what is occurring in the preselection battle for Bradfield is merely the economic side of this policy extending into the political arena. I would be very upset if anybody on the other side of the House suggested that government members are planting a mole or a trojan horse in the inner sanctum of the opposition. I would take offence to that. I know that you cannot change a leopard's spots overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can give honourable members on the other side a commitment, and this commitment also comes from a few government members that I have spoken to. If the dapper doctor were to occupy a position of responsibility on the shadow front bench, government members would not put any pressure on him to disclose the opposition's tactics, to give us an inside into new opposition policy initiatives or to tell us who is getting into whom in the shadow cabinet. We certainly would not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the fence are very happy to see one of our sons have a run in the other side's team. I think I speak for all members on this side of the House when I say that we would be very happy to see a bloke who used to be on our side take a safe seat on the other side. I think that would be cause for some celebration to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, from all the trade unionists on this side of the House&mdash;and we know that Dr Nelson is a very proud trade unionist&mdash;we wish the dapper doctor well in his preselection battle for the seat of Bradfield. We hope that we do not have to come back here in a couple of weeks and commiserate with the honourable member for Bradfield if he is rolled in the preselection. I wish the other team and the dapper doctor all the best. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the tremendous spirit of the people in the township of Gordonvale in my electorate. On 21 April I attended the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Mulgrave Central Mill, located in Gordonvale. The next day I also attended celebrations in Gordonvale, which included the new opening of the Norman Park forecourt and the unveiling of the cane workers statue and mosaic. This was funded by the Mulgrave Shire Council and was a bequest from the Crossland family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gordonvale is a 20-minute drive south of the Cairns CBD. The majority of the residents, if not directly employed in the sugar industry or the mill, benefit economically in many ways from the sugar industry. The original inhabitants of the land around Gordonvale were the Yidinydji tribe, who lived near the Mulgrave River. The earliest white settlement dates back to 1877. Employment of cane cutters in the seasonal cane industry was the mainstay for the township of Gordonvale in the first half of the 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, with the advent of mechanical sugar harvesting in the 1960s, Gordonvale began the long story of decline that is common to so many of those outlying North Queensland hamlets. A dramatic drop in population caused the income to the town's retailers to vanish, and a subsequent bypassing of the town by the Bruce Highway only worsened the situation. The regional city of Cairns attracted the major services, and it was able to offer more in the way of shopping and cultural events. This is an all too familiar scenario that would normally constitute the death sentence for a rural township like Gordonvale. It is a credit to the residents that they have refused to take this situation lying down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Friends of Gordonvale is an organisation dedicated to the preservation of the cultural and historic values of the township from the ever encroaching suburbs of Cairns. In 1991 it successfully obtained an Australia Council grant for funding to carry out the Gordonvale townscape plan to identify areas of significance to the local community. One of the initiatives to come from this study was the development of Norman Park as a focal point for residents and visitors to the town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Australia Day 1994 I was pleased to attend the opening of the Richard and Sarah Blackwell Pavilion, which was made possible with the assistance of a $50,000 Commonwealth grant. The project was of such a high quality that, in late 1993, it was awarded the inaugural community, environment, art and design award for innovative approaches to environmental design. On that day I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt Gordonvale is setting the pace Australia wide in terms of community involvement in the preservation and enhancement of town character.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to pay tribute to the Friends of Gordonvale, especially June Fermo and her hardworking committee, including Mary McLachlan and Jan Alley. I also want to pay tribute to the local author and farmer, Clive Morton, whose excellent history of the Mulgrave Central Mill, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">By Strong Arms</EMPHASIS>, was launched on the night of 21 April. I thank the board members of the Mulgrave Central Mill for their hospitality on that anniversary, and I also thank members of the Friends of Gordonvale for the hospitality they extended to me on the next day in Alley Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some concern that the amalgamation of Cairns city and the Mulgrave shire would be an additional threat to the identity of Gordonvale. However, I am confident that Tom Pyne, the newly elected Cairns mayor, understands the aspirations of the residents of Gordonvale. I am also confident that their interests will be well looked after by all levels of government. This is a very important principle. It is not an easy task to re-establish the pride in a town that has been harshly treated by circumstance. The work that has been done in the redesign and improvement of the centre of the Gordonvale township is a credit to the members of that community, especially the Friends of Gordonvale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the funds this government has spent represent money very well spent in supporting not only the Friends of Gordonvale but also the whole community, and in assisting this very special township to regain its sense of character. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I bring to the attention of the House an issue which is continually coming before me in my electorate office and which people are expressing concern about. It is an increasingly more frequent result of high youth employment. We have known for many years that the youth unemployment rate throughout the country has been in excess of 30 per cent. What appears to have been evolving over recent years is an exploitation of these young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously it is a buyers market and there are some employers who are, I believe, exploiting that situation excessively. For example, in the hospitality industry, young people are being offered the opportunity to work. They are told that if they offer themselves for a couple of shifts and are found acceptable they may be taken on. The situation that has been drawn to my attention on a number of occasions is that of young people working for some time, for some days, before they are told, `Sorry, we don't need you.' I have been surprised at something that I did not think would be a growth industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went into the work force as a young man of 15 or 16 years of age, I was treated very fairly by all employers. There was never any dispute or argument about what was a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I think we need to become aware that, where we have these very high levels of youth unemployment and the opportunities are not there, there seems to be this increasing tendency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had parents come into one of my electorate offices the other day making mention of the offer of a job in the city. A young person came out of year 11 because of the offer of employment. That young person went down to Adelaide from their regional city on the promise of a job, for many weeks was basically just given the bum steer and eventually had to leave. You can imagine the situation of this young person, isolated from family and at a distance from all things familiar; and you can imagine the cost for the parents, struggling to survive in their own right, back in the regional city, trying to give their child support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this highlights the reality of something in modern day Australia which is of concern to me: the dangling of the opportunity of work, with some exploitation by employers no doubt. More importantly, it shows a system for which the government has to be brought to book. I reiterate the point that when I grew up in this country with a sense, I believe, of a fair go the system was fairer than the one we currently have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we can talk about the unions. There would be many on the other side who would encourage me to encourage young people to join unions, et cetera, but the unions seem to be more interested in those that pay their fees while the rest can please themselves. Therefore, I am not sure that is the answer. I think it is a more deeply rooted situation than that, but I do bring it to the attention of the House. I think it is something that we as a nation should be aware of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week has provided us with a dramatic example of just how vulnerable our ocean environment is. From Bass Strait to the shores of Western Australia, there have been billions of dying pilchards. These fish are the main food source of Australian salmon and the southern bluefin tuna, so the shock will go through the food chain of the Southern Ocean.</PARA></TALK.START>

From that small beginning has come these far-reaching results. We should by the late 20th century have learnt from nature and from our own man-made failures to be very protective of our ocean resources. As a community, we must fight to protect and preserve our precious marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Brisbane we are confronted with a hasty and sloppy decision to select two alternative sites at the mouth of the Brisbane River, Pinkenba and Luggage Point, at which to build a hazardous waste treatment dump. This is a decision which puts at risk the environment of Moreton Bay, adjacent suburbs and, given that the Brisbane River is tidal, all the suburbs along the river's banks. The risk of accidental spillage into Moreton Bay is not an invention of me or any of the other critics of the decision. If you turn to page 12 of the basic report from Dames and Moore, which recommended this location, you will find the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is important to maintain a buffer to reduce the risk of environmental damage resulting from accidental spillage or fire . . .</PARA>
<PARA>On the next page the key words are repeated that there must be a sufficient buffer zone in which accidental spills can be monitored and managed. The selection of these two sites at Pinkenba, Bulmar Island and Luggage Point comes from the Willawong Technological Assessment Committee&mdash;a body of Brisbane city councillors and a Queensland Green, who, acting on the advice of Dames and Moore, had been given the job of reviewing and making future proposals for the disposal of hazardous waste in south-east Queensland&mdash;which recommended these two sites. The consultant's report on spills was misleadingly vague about the details of what the polluting spills from this kind of plant might be. The Willawong committee let the cat out of the bag when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant potential environmental impacts associated with the treatment of acid/alkali/metal waste would be expected to be cyanide and ammonia spills.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not only a matter of cyanide and ammonia spills. Other chemicals mentioned in the two reports include pesticides and paint wastes, industrial sludges, contaminated soil and oily water waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report from the consultants was hasty and inadequate, internally contradictory and at times misleading. No field work was done. The report is being described as a desk-top report; that is, produced as a result of working in an office from maps and photos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flawed as it is, the Dames and Moore report did at least acknowledge that there was the possibility of accidental spillage or fires present, but neither the consultants nor the Willawong Technological Assessment Committee made any reasoned assessment of the potential risks of spillage or fire or of the impact on air for those who live around Moreton Bay or along the Brisbane River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 there were fires on two successive days at the Coode Island chemical storage facility in the inner west of Melbourne, which held the same kinds of dangerous chemicals that will be treated at this treatment dump. Damage, spillage and air pollution was extensive. Neither the consultant nor the committee thought this was worth consideration in their reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hidden away in the small print of the Dames and Moore report were some asides which further pointed to the unsuitability of either of these two sites. It was admitted that the soils could present foundation problems and there were other contradictory and illogical opinions. We read in the report that ground water at the Willawong site was a factor in the plant's not being sited there, but the fact of saline ground water at Luggage Point and Pinkenba did not matter in the desk-top report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another twisted bit of logic is the claim that the river mouth sites are justified because 40 per cent of potential waste comes from near Pinkenba. The truth is that more than 50 per cent comes from the south-western fringes of the city. This is a percentage which is increasing, while Pinkenba's contribution is declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly clear that the Dames and Moore report was commissioned and rushed through to avoid the possibility of a searching and rigorous examination of all the potential sites. Such an investigation would throw out the proposal for the Pinkenba and Luggage Point sites on one ground not even mentioned by the consultants; that is, the history of floods of the Brisbane River. The fact is that in 1974 the Brisbane River flooded two-thirds of Brisbane suburbs. At the flood's peak that year of six metres, these areas being considered would certainly have been inundated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these factors together, some mentioned in the report and some not&mdash;the spillages, the threat to the marine environment, pollution of the atmosphere, shonky foundations&mdash;add up to the fact that this report is totally inadequate. On top of this, you have the threat of a big flood and potential fires like those which occurred at Coode Island in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recommend these two sites is simply madness. This cannot be said to be a `not in my backyard' argument for the residents of Lilley alone.

I want to bring to the notice of the House a case where one of my constituents has been battling bureaucracy for nearly three years without much success.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Terrance Daw lived for a time in New Guinea. In 1969 he was admitted to a hospital in Rabaul after a traffic accident suffering from fractures, abrasions and contusions. Superficially Mr Daw recovered from these injuries well enough. However, his doctors agreed there was considerable permanent deformation around his hip. Mr Daw was awarded the New Guinea maximum compensation of $8,000 for his injuries some time later, even though authorities agreed his injuries were far more limiting than this figure testified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992, Mr Daw applied to Comcare for further compensation, having been informed by the Papua New Guinea Retired Officers Association that New Guinea administration employees were eligible for such. The Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled in decision No. 4789 of 1988 that members who `were employed by the administration or the Commonwealth government in PNG prior to independence and who have some medical condition concerning which their employment in PNG was a contributing factor' entitled members to similar benefits due to Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Daw is a patient man. He waited until October 1992 for a reply to his initial application to Comcare. On 14 October he wrote again, requesting information about his claim and advice. Following this letter he was sent a claim form from Comcare which he submitted on 21 October 1992. On 30 November 1993, Mr Daw inquired about his situation by post. On 1 December 1993, Mr Daw was contacted by telephone to inform him his claim form had not arrived at Comcare. Two weeks later he received a letter from Comcare informing him his claim would be considered swiftly. On 1 July 1994, Mr Daw wrote again asking how his claim was progressing and was informed on 7 July 1994 that Comcare did not have a claim from him. He was advised to forward a claim as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question Mr Daw could not answer was whether or not his claim had arrived at all. One contact said it had been received and referred elsewhere for advice and direction and a second contact stated it had never been received. Remember this is all more than two years after Mr Daw contacted Comcare in the first instance. On 19 October 1994, Mr Daw again wrote to Comcare expressing his puzzlement that after almost three years his claim had not only not been finalised but for all intents and purposes been floating around in limbo land at Comcare&mdash;like passing the parcel at a child's party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 November, a Comcare staff member contacted Mr Daw to say the matter would be looked into again. Mr Daw was a permanent officer in Papua New Guinea for 19 years before his accident. Now he is a superannuant. Will Mr Daw have to wait 19 more years for his claim to be looked at by Comcare? His superannuation payments are made through Comsuper here in Canberra. Comcare's head office is here in Canberra. Surely the relevant information can be discovered between these two bodies before Mr Daw passes away from writer's cramp, sending polite letters across the country for another few years without any tangible result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising tonight I thought it was worthy to just add a little to question time today. A bombshell has exploded the government's budget predictions into fragments. That bombshell is to inform the parliament of something the government should surely have known because it is certainly no secret: the Commonwealth Bank Ltd, the public company, has articles of association. They are a requirement of the incorporation of any body of that nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advised, and I am sure it is true, that the government has to get the approval of the shareholders to sell its share to anybody. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us on radio this morning how he had expertly manipulated this particular process of dealing with the board and everybody else regarding the balance of this institution, this icon of government and government banking over decades.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would think he would. He was telling us how stunned and stupid we apparently looked last night. I do not recollect that as a matter of fact. I thought we looked pretty comfortable. The reality is that there were some very stunned people, including the Treasurer (Mr Willis), here today as this matter was drawn to their attention. He used a very light coloured make-up last night for his television appearance, but I have to say that he looked a lot whiter as this issue came up. Let us look at the facts. As I understand it&mdash;and I stand to be corrected on this aspect&mdash;it is normal, when government or some very large shareholder exercises 51 per cent of the vote in a company, that they are denied their right to use it. So, when under the articles of association of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia we talk about a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, we are talking about 75 per cent of half the ownership&mdash;those shareholders who bought shares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those shareholders applied originally for the first tranche, as it is called, and did very well. They were mums and dads to a large degree and they lined up for the second half. They learned one lesson of investing: as you start to feed too much of the same product into the market, its value depreciates. I think those who burnt their fingers on the second round and saw the value of their original shares depreciate somewhat would be very reluctant to see the Commonwealth unload the second half of its shares or ownership of that bank onto the market. I thought it rather amazing when we were told yesterday that this sleight of hand of selling the bank will somehow add to the pool of national savings. If the Commonwealth sells the bank to the private sector, the private sector will borrow the money from somewhere to buy the bank. The net result, at best, will be neutral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has the money to spend but the private sector no longer has; it owns the bank. So the first thing is that the shareholders are going to be extremely reluctant to agree, on the grounds that their shares may devalue further with this massive body coming on. Secondly, they know the financial markets are weak because the government is allowing so much to be borrowed to finance our overseas debts&mdash;it is still going to borrow quite a bit of money this year. So the financial markets might struggle to find that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor is one the Treasurer alluded to today. He said, `We have another little worry: the government guarantee.' The Commonwealth Bank, with the government as a 51 per cent shareholder, still has the massive advantage of a government guarantee which no doubt is reducing the price at which it borrows funds relative to the price for its competitors. You cannot tell me that the share market, particularly the bigger players, is not cognisant of this fact. If that guarantee is going to be lost, that will devalue the shares further. </PARA>

We go from $700 million of mythical surplus to $3,300 million, at least, of deficit and the government is in the hands of these people who are going to make their judgments on what is in it for them. The Commonwealth Bank Employees Union is going to be out there telling these people it is all bad news. And the government thinks it can get this through in a year and balance its budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Funding is available for upgrading water storage or reticulation systems in towns. However, infrastructure of this type is usually the province of State and Local Government which receive separate Commonwealth funding under the Financial Assistance Grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a possibility that water supply projects would be funded under the Regional Development Program, where the Commonwealth has provided some $70 million over four years for regional infrastructure projects. It should be noted that these funds will be used in a catalytic way towards economic development both from a regional and national viewpoint. A key objective is to leverage funding from other sources, that is, other governments and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To be eligible for this funding, an infrastructure project must be identified and prioritised by a regional development organisation recognised under the Regional Development Program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. I am aware of this tragic case. A coroners inquest will be held on May 23 and 24.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. Australian Standard AS2869:1986 was in fact the first quality standard for tampons anywhere in the world. This Standard has been observed by industry and used for testing by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The current Australian and New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 2869:1995, published on 5 March, remains the only published quality standard for menstrual tampons in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tampon absorbency is the only generally recognised, device related predictor of risk in the association of tampon use with Toxic Shock Syndrome. The current Australian Standard places stricter controls on the maximum allowable absorbency than is specified in the USA Code of Federal Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US regulation deals only with labelling and provides a standardised test for absorbency whereas the 1995 Australian Standard, as did the 1986 Standard, additionally covers cleanliness, composition, design and performance requirements. The Australian Standard is an improvement on the US regulations because it allows women to compare absorbencies between different brands of tampon, regardless of the common terms used to describe the tampon by the manufacturer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The leaflet required in tampon packs by the revised Australian Standard includes information that TSS can be serious and potentially fatal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The Therapeutic Goods Act contains no provisions to empower the TGA to ban products.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)(i) The answer to this question is complicated by the fact that while appropriations and outlays are related, they are conceptually different and extreme caution should be exercised in expressing one as a percentage of the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payments from appropriations and receipts are accounting concepts which measure the gross flow of funds out of, into and between the three funds (the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), the Trust Fund and the Loan Fund) which comprise the Commonwealth Public Account. This reflects the requirements in sections 81 and 83 of the Constitution that all moneys received by the Commonwealth shall form a single Consolidated Revenue Fund and that no moneys shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under an appropriation made by law. This concept is predominantly concerned with ensuring that all moneys received by the Commonwealth have been properly accounted for and that Commonwealth money is spent only on the purpose for which it was provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outlays are an economic concept based on standards established by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which in turn integrate standards promulgated by the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. In the budget context, outlays measure the net cost of providing general government goods and services allocated through collective political choice rather than by the operation of the market. Therefore receipts from user charges are offset against relevant payments in calculating outlays. There are two other major categories of receipts which are offset against payments in the calculation of outlays; the repayment of advances (including loans to government business agencies, to the States and the provision of equity to enterprises) and the receipts from asset sales involving the sale of equity and/or physical assets. Presentation of Budget figuring in this format facilitates inter and intra national comparisons independent of local administrative structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all payments from appropriations of the CRF are classified as outlays. For example, some payments from appropriations are classified as financing transactions rather than outlays as they involve the financing or investing of a budget deficit or surplus. Similarly, some payments from appropriations of the CRF  are classified as offsets within revenue as they are considered to be adjustments to revenues collected. These are, principally, certain refunds of taxation receipts, payments related to interest, rent and dividends received by the Commonwealth and payments to the Higher Education Scheme Trust Account of loan repayments received through the taxation system. In addition, certain contingency appropriations, namely the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the Provision for Running Cost Borrowings (and their equivalents for the Parliamentary Departments) are appropriated in the annual Appropriation Bills but are not included in estimated outlays until any recourse to those appropriations is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, not all transactions classified as outlays involve appropriations of the CRF; the transactions of the Trust Fund and the Loan Fund also make net contributions to Budget outlays. Also, provision is made within estimates of Budget outlays for administrative underspends and certain bulk allowances in anticipation of possible cost escalation during the year. The latter provision is </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">only appropriated (through the Additional Appropriation Bills) if and when the cost increases to which they relate actually occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Table 1 in Budget Paper No. 2 (The Commonwealth Public Account) highlights the contribution of transactions of each of the three funds to the economic concepts of outlays, revenue and financing transactions. Table 2 in the same document provides a reconciliation of appropriations of the CRF to Budget outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining those amounts which are subject to the annual scrutiny of the Parliament, it should be noted that the legislative provision which permits charging certain Defence expenditure, for which provision has been made in the annual Appropriation Bills, to the Loan Fund rather than the CRF is contained in the annual Loan Act which is introduced into and considered by the Parliament in the Budget Session each year. Similarly, sub-section 35(3) of the Audit Act 1901 makes provision for the supplementation of certain annual appropriations (eg through the crediting of user charges), however, only the net amount of appropriations sought is included in the schedule to the Appropriation Acts. The terms and conditions under which those net amounts may be supplemented is contained within sections 7 and 8 of Appropriation Act (No. 1). In addition, while certain appropriations such as those for general purpose and education assistance to the States and Territories are provided for in separate legislation to the annual Appropriation Bills, legislation authorising each of these categories of payments is submitted to Parliament annually for approval.</PARA>

For example, some amendments to the legislation over the past 15 years will have renamed the relevant legislation or amended the nature and or extent of the payments which may be made under it. In other circumstances authority for specific payments may have been replaced by new legislation which provides authority for similar payments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government is already a major fund provider for farm safety programs. By way of example, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's Rural Access Program has recently provided funding in support of projects concerned with improving tractor safety on farms, farm chemical user courses for women and methods of empowering communities to effectively deal with injury prevention and noise induced hearing loss in the rural community. Through its membership of the Rural Training Council of Australia, the Government is ensuring that farm safety is an important part of rural training courses. Farmsafe Australia Inc, and the many local volunteer groups associated with it, have put agriculture at the forefront by developing a risk management approach to farm health and safety. A major recent initiative was the development, with the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, of the Farm Injury in Australia Conference which provided a forum for the discussion of problems and the development of action plans aimed at improving farm safety.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a) Based on the information which has been supplied by the ASC from its public records, it is not possible to say that the company known as Australian Funerals Pty Ltd ("AF") is owned by US rather then Australian interests. The information lodged with the ASC regarding AF reveals that Credicorp Finance Pty Ltd owns all the ordinary shares of AF and that Credit Union Australia Limited, a body corporate incorporated in Queensland, is the ultimate holding company. Two of AF's office holders were born in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission has advised that AF was acquired by Stewart Enterprises Australia Pty Ltd ("Stewart") on or about 9 December 1994. The company extracts reveal that six office holders in Stewart are also office holders in AF. I understand that the majority of shares in Stewart are allotted to a public listed US company known as Stewart Enterprises Inc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Prior to its acquisition by Stewart, AF owned or traded as the organisations referred to in (i) to (x). Accordingly, since late last year, Stewart has acquired ownership of these businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) and (b) The Trade Practices Commission is making enquiries into the funeral industry, including acquisitions of funeral directors, crematoria and cemeteries to ascertain whether the acquisitions are a breach of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Section 50 of that Act states that an acquisition of shares or assets is in breach of the section if it has the effect or is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market for goods or services in Australia, in a State or in a Territory. The fact that an acquirer is a foreign or a local organisation is not necessarily an issue for the Commission but may be an issue for the Foreign Investment Review Branch of Treasury. I am advised by the Branch that under the Government's foreign investment policy, acquisitions by foreign persons of businesses in the services sector, which includes the funeral industry, are normally approved unless judged contrary to the national interest. Foreign investment approval was granted to Stewart to acquire AF and its associated businesses on 1 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) A foreign owned company may be in breach of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 if it claims to be "Proudly Australian". Section 52 states that a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. When considering whether for instance an advertising brochure is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, it is necessary to examine the overall impression created by the brochure. A foreign owned company could be held liable for a breach of the provision, if the expression "Proudly Australian" was found to convey to the relevant section of the public the impression that the company using it was Australian owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Trade Practices Commission is making enquiries about the booklet published by AF entitled "All about funerals". On the front page of this booklet appears the words "Proudly Australian" under the name "Australian Funerals Group". The Commission understands that the booklet was published prior to the acquisition of AF by Stewart. The Commission has been advised by Stewart that it is in the process of printing new copies of the booklet. It will be in substantially the same form as the earlier booklet, however the reference to "Proudly Australian" will be deleted. The company has also advised the Commission that the words "Proudly Australian" will be deleted from all other publications and promotional material of Stewart and its subsidiary companies in Australia.</PARA>

It was thought that limiting the exemption to cars below the threshold value would limit the choice available to people with a disability; this could be important if vehicles priced below the luxury car tax threshold did not fulfil the requirements of certain people with a disability.

The Government anticipates that this represents a substantial increase in the level of private sector activity over the previous twelve months. This view is supported by indices of considerable growth in the hearing services sector in the past two years, with greater numbers of private practitioners (In mid 1993 120 accredited practitioners provided services under contracts with Australian Hearing Services; this number has now grown to over 230) and high trading figures in Australia reported by international hearing aid manufacturers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)(b)&amp;(c) At 1 July 1995, when Parenting Allowance commences, an estimated 152,000 Partner Allowees are expected to transfer to Parenting Allowance. An estimated 487,000 recipients of Home Child Care Allowance will transfer to Parenting Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 1 July 1995, there will be no new grants of Home Child Care Allowance and partners of new Job Search Allowance/Newstart Allowance recipients with dependent children aged under 16 will be eligible for Parenting Allowance. Accordingly, there will be no transfers from Home Child Care Allowance to Parenting Allowance after 1 July 1995. Transfers from Partner Allowance will occur where such a Partner Allowee gives birth to a first child, or a child comes into the allowee's care. In addition, partnered Job Search, Newstart or Sickness Allowees, or Special Beneficiaries with a child may choose to transfer to Parenting Allowance. Similarly, sole parent pensioners or allowees partnering with a social security client or a low income earner may transfer to Parenting Allowance. There is no statistical information on the likely number of such transfers. However, the numbers are expected to be small.</PARA>
