<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I call the clerk, I wish to respond to two issues raised in the parliament yesterday. The first is the dispute within the nurses centre here at Parliament House. I refer to my answer to a question from the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) yesterday. The matter was considered late yesterday by the Industrial Relations Commission. The commissioner made the following recommendations: the Australian Nursing Federation should cease industrial action and resume normal duties; the Joint House Department should take no action to remove the higher duties allowance for the nurse acting in the vacant registered nurse grade 3 position before the matter is resolved; the Australian Nursing Federation will supply in reasonable detail its written objections to management's proposal by Thursday, 29 June 1995; the Joint House Department will respond to that in writing by Thursday, 6 July 1995; the parties will meet to discuss the issues in the week commencing 10 July 1985; the commission will chair a meeting of the parties on 17 July 1995 if the matter is not resolved. The Australian Nursing Federation ceased industrial action and staff of the nursing centre recommenced work at 6.20 p.m. on 27 June 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the points I made yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will recall that after question time yesterday both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) asked me a series of questions about the operation of the microphones in the chamber. I undertook to provide advice to the House on the matter. Honourable members who have sat in this House since 1988 will be well aware that the acoustics of the chamber have been unsatisfactory since the first day of sitting. Mind you, it would be helped if there were less noise in the chamber from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Cowper indeed knows what I am referring to. Since 1988 a great deal of effort and money has been invested in seeking firstly to improve the then existing sound reinforcement system and subsequently in 1991 replacing it with a new system. Honourable members who have experienced both systems would agree that the replacement system is vastly superior&mdash;so it was pretty crook when we started.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guiding principle of the chamber sound system is that the open microphone follows the Speaker's call. Any member's microphone is not opened until such time as the member is recognised by the occupant of the chair. In most circumstances this is a very straightforward procedure. However, there are times, as we are all aware, where some members seek to continue their remarks or comments after the occupant of the chair has called another member to contribute to the debate. The sound operators must then activate the microphone of the member who has been given the call. The sound operator on duty yesterday was a very long serving and experienced parliamentary officer. Only one person in the chamber has a microphone permanently activated, and that is the occupant of the Speaker's chair. All other microphones must be activated by the operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in his contribution to the discussion suggested that it may be worth while keeping the microphones at the two dispatch boxes permanently open as well. I have asked the Sound and Vision Office to review the operation of the sound system in the chamber and investigate this possibility. Without prejudging the outcome of that investigation, may I also make the point that, while it is true, as the right honourable member for New England said, that the microphones exist primarily to allow members in the chamber to hear proceedings, the microphones also perform a very important and significant function in that they are the source of sound for both radio and television broadcasting and the House monitoring service. What the consequences would be for the quality and the intelligibility of those radio and television broadcasts of having three microphones open at the one time is a matter that needs to be looked at carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me whether any instructions had been given to vary the volume of microphones in the chamber. There have been no instructions given in respect of volume. The sound operators in the control room behind the chamber are monitoring intensity and quality of the sound and constantly making fine adjustments to the sound levels to ensure consistent and clear sound both in the chamber and for the radio, television and House monitoring service broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only change that has been made in recent times has been the use of the sound effects microphone located on the pillar to my left for television, radio and House monitoring service broadcasts. This microphone is now used to capture ambient and background sound during divisions and at other times during the operation of the parliament. The output from this microphone is not relayed into the chamber and has no effect on the sound reinforcement system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those microphones have been in place since 1988 and I am advised there were similar microphones in the old Parliament House. I understand that on other occasions microphones have been placed to pick up the background sounds. For instance, it has been suggested that they were placed on the end of the chamber table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable members that the sound operators perform a professional task to the best of their abilities in often difficult circumstances. I am sure all honourable members would agree that they do their jobs with great commitment and with absolute even-handedness and impartiality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also reference to instructions to the camera operators. My only instruction, which was conveyed through the Serjeant-at-Arms, was to clarify one of the guidelines which provided that the cameras focus on the member with the call. I suggested that the focus should be from the front and not the back. This has meant that shots over the shoulders of the member with the call are no longer permitted. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Geological Survey Organisation currently occupies a number of buildings, the largest of which is the Anzac Park East offices on Constitution Avenue where it has been since 1965. There is an urgent need for new and appropriate accommodation to overcome the currently unacceptable level of non-compliance with fire, health and safety regulations at Anzac Park East. The new building complex will also allow co-location of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation's dispersed activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal, which was referred to the very hardworking Public Works Committee on 5 December 1994, is for the construction of a new building complex comprising laboratories and related areas, offices and administrative support areas, storage areas, engineering workshops, roads, car parks, civil works and even landscaping. The proposed complex is to be located on a greenfield site of approximately 16 hectares on Hindmarsh Drive, Symonston, ACT, with the road boundaries of Jerrabomberra Avenue to the west and the Eastern Parkway&mdash;that is, the Monaro Highway&mdash;to the east. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the proposal was first heard by the Public Works Committee on 14 February 1995, one of its many arduous tasks that month, it has been established that the environmental clearance could not be completed for the original site in time to commence construction of the new building complex early in 1996. The ACT government has offered an alternative location with arrangements agreed for the survey of the possible presence of two rare lizard species and for their removal if present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is anticipated that construction will commence in March 1996 with completion in 1998. The limit of costs for the project is $105 million at December 1994 prices.

<PARA>The CSIRO laboratory complex will be consistent with a long-term CSIRO strategy to integrate and consolidate compatible research resources and facilities on a small number of major regional sites. The Port Melbourne site is a converted paint factory on a state government lease and has been the subject of an adverse occupational health and safety investigation and is inadequate due to the old buildings, lack of space and high infrastructure costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak in the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995. In my view, the important part of this bill is what is contained in the last part&mdash;family measures. We hear so much from those opposite about their concern for Australian families and about our supposed neglect of the battlers in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is yet another example of concrete proof that the Labor Party is initiating changes to ensure that an even greater number of Australians, and Australian families, actually benefit from legislation initiated in this place by a party firmly resolved to look after all Australians. Since this government came into office in 1983 there have been huge improvements in the quality of the social security safety net&mdash;increases in real terms in targeted payments to low income families, real increases in pensions, very substantial increases in rental assistance and, to those unfortunate enough to be unemployed, real increases in benefits in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not usually one to cast aspersions on what those opposite did when last in power. All I would urge my constituents to do when it comes to family measures is look at what happened to key benefits in real terms when those opposite were in control of the private purse, and examine in great detail their current proposals on family policy, which, in my view, will benefit a marginalised section of the Australian community and disadvantage low income families. Those opposite can say what they like, but our achievements speak for themselves, and speak volumes for our real commitment to all families, irrespective of their circumstances. The measures contained in this bill are a further strengthening of this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women and families are big winners from this year's budget as the government continues to address their needs and concerns as a matter of high priority. This boost in assistance to families continues the government's commitment to addressing inequality in Australian society and offers real support for women to exercise real choices in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure contained in this bill which I would like to speak about is the introduction of a maternity allowance which honours the government's commitment in Accord Mark VII to `give consideration to introducing a maternity allowance paid through the social security system in the spirit of ILO convention 103'. This is one of those so-called international treaties which frightens the pants off so many of those opposite, who regularly accuse us of exploiting these treaty obligations to force horrid things onto families across this nation. I think the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) refers to us as `social engineers'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This maternity allowance payment will help families to meet the costs of any additional children, and this is often the time when there is a real decline in a family's income. Most of us here can surely remember the impact that this had on our families and the disposable income of our households. The maternity allowance payment is equal to six weeks full parenting allowance&mdash;that is, $816&mdash;and is payable as a lump sum. The good thing is that it will be indexed in March and September of each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligibility for this allowance is the same as that for the basic family payment&mdash;very generous indeed. Family income can be up to $61,020 a year, with an additional $3,051 for each child after the first. By the way, these limits are also indexed in January of each year. The asset limits are also very generous. Family assets, excluding the family home, can be up to $559,250. This limit is also indexed in January of each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beauty of changes being made to the family payment income test which are to be introduced from 1 January 1996&mdash;I will talk about that later&mdash;will mean that eligibility can be based on an estimate of income in the current financial year if income should go down relative to the last financial year. This will be an enormous boost to those families in which the mother has stopped working in order to have the baby but the drop in family income has been less than 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What number of people will benefit from this allowance? This maternity allowance will be paid for an estimated 223,000 children in a full year. Paid maternity leave will not have an impact on eligibility for the maternity allowance unless the amount paid puts a family's income over the basic family payment income limit; for example, the limit is $61,020 for the first baby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 January 1996, the maternity allowance and the basic family payment can be claimed on one form, available from local social security offices or hospital maternity wards. People will have up to 13 weeks from the baby's birth to apply. This is yet another great example of this government's commitment to Australian families which has been honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next aspect of the bill I wish to address is the amalgamation of the family payment and changes to the family payment income test. I would like to compliment the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) on his strong resolve to simplify and clarify the system of family payments and to be more responsive to changes which overcome the perceived inequities in this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long we have been saddled with an intricate system which is difficult to understand and open to a great number of inequities. As a former staffer, I am very well aware of the anxiety out there in the community caused by issues which have now been addressed in this section of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill we are introducing a single, age related family payment which will simplify this payment and make it easier for families to better understand their entitlements. Instead of having five rates, we are now having three rates of family payment, which will vary only with the age of the child. For each child aged under 12 a fortnightly payment of $88.90 will be received; for each child aged between 13 and 15 a fortnightly payment of $115.80 will be received; for full-time dependent secondary students aged between 16 and 18, a fortnightly payment of $55.70 will be received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The single income test will also allow for real improvements in the processing of payments. A single claim for family payment will replace claims for basic family payment and additional family payment which are currently processed separately. This will ensure that families receive their full family payment entitlement when they apply for payment or reassessment. Yet another example of a far more simpler, more accessible and more flexible system is the combination of the application, review and reassessment processes for family payment and child-care assistance from January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From then on, families will need only to provide details about their income and other circumstances once to claim both payments on one easy to understand form, and they will get just one letter telling them of their entitlements. How sensible. One wonders why we have not done it before. Probably the most satisfying measure in this bill is the decision by the government to be far more responsive when it comes to the family payment income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said previously, those of us who are former staffers who have been pestered by people who have been the recipients of some of the inequities and those of us who do keep close tabs on the issues raised in our electorate offices will know that this issue more than most causes great angst out there in the electorate. The so-called 25 per cent rule was very harsh. From 1 January 1996, the complaints coming into our electorate offices will hopefully cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families who experience a decline in income of whatever magnitude will be able to have their rate of family payment reassessed immediately on the basis of their estimated current financial year income&mdash;when they need it, instead of the current wait until the next financial calendar year. Families will be able to update income estimates at any time and as often as they wish. Conversely, families whose situations change for the better financially, by a spouse returning to work after the birth of a child or by having their income increase by more than 10 per cent, have to have their family payment entitlement reassessed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, these new arrangements will be far more responsive to both increases and decreases in income so that the level of assistance to families throughout Australia will more closely reflect their current needs. As I said previously, this is a great change and one that will have enormous benefits to a great range of families. I do sincerely compliment the minister for his resolve to implement these changes. The number of families who will benefit from this imaginative, flexible and responsive change is 62,000 Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last changes in this bill relate to changes to some Austudy and related family payments. This impacts on those families who are currently dealing with DEET and DSS. Those of us, as I say, who were staffers will realise that it is hard enough at times to deal with one federal government department, let alone deal with two on similar related issues, filling out forms and trying to compare rates and the like. It is rather difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another example of a simpler, more accessible and more flexible operation which allows families out there in the electorate to better access and better understand the payments they and their children receive. In this regard, the family payment income free area will be aligned with the Austudy income free area and the assets limits for Austudy will be set at the family payment level. Also, the student dependency income limits will be set at the 18-year-old away from home rate of Austudy and measured over a financial year. The maximum age of dependency of students will be aligned at the Austudy age of 21. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures contained in this bill, together with a number of other measures announced in this year's budget, will enable families to deal more effectively and more completely with different departments when their children turn that magical age of 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I briefly mention the change to family payments from 1 January 1996. This is in the area of payments to a couple in the primary carer area. It is a sensible arrangement which will allow, once again, more flexibility. I think it will benefit the women of Australia enormously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned several times, these changes are welcomed by a vast number of Australian families, not only for the financial benefits they will receive but probably just as greatly for the simplification of the whole process which so many of them have been frustrated with for so long. I compliment the minister and the government for their commitment and their resolve to see these things implemented. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995. We all know that it introduces the maternity allowance, provides for the amalgamation of the basic and additional family payment to ensure family payment is paid to the primary carer of the child whether the carer is the mother or the father, and contains amendments to align the indexation method and the assets level of the family payment and Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of social security, as we all know, is to try to deal with what are seen to be perhaps shortfalls in a social wage. It gives me no joy to say this, but I come from one of the poorest electorates in Australia. If you look at the statistics that we all have access to, you will see that the poorest 25 per cent of electorates in Australia, having incomes between $25,000 and $28,000 approximately, are all, bar two, in regional Australia. These figures have been compiled from the 1991 census. We can understand, I am sure, that, with the various factors that have happened in the last four years, no doubt that situation would not have improved and probably has got worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We used to have a debate in this country about the redistribution of wealth. After all, this is what social security is about. That is what a lot of these payments are about; that is, trying to supplement people's incomes to get them up to a reasonable living wage. Over the years, we have seen that redistribution situation come out at where regional Australia is on about half the average income of the wealthiest metropolitan electorates of this country. If you take the bottom quarter of the 147 electorates and compare it with the top quarter, you see that there is a very big disparity in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My case this morning is going to rest on the fact that the coalition, not that it deliberately sought the task, now represents the low income people of Australia. Many years ago, when I did not know very much about politics, I presumed it was the Labor Party that represented the low income people of Australia. That is why I am so offended when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accuses us on this side of the House of happily hopping into low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that it is the Prime Minister who happily hops into working people or low income people. We only have to look at the increases in the various taxes, including the indirect taxes. Every 12 months we have this&mdash;what would we call it?&mdash;circus, which is one description, of a grab for more taxes in the lower house, a debate in the upper house, the Senate, and negotiations where we end up with the absurdity in question time, as has happened on the previous two days of this week, of those on this side of the House being accused of affecting interest rate rises and being told that we are blocking supply. That is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to the Canberra by-election, the fear of political defeat is weighing very heavily on this government's mind. Its 12 years of policies, which have led and contributed to the low income situation which necessitates social security legislation such as this, are coming home to roost. The government can throw all the rhetoric it likes at the coalition. But, when it comes down to the record of the last decade, the Labor government is clearly a high taxing government which has failed to improve Australia's standard of living&mdash;and there can be no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has left low income people and many working people of Australia behind. He has been in the parliament for 25 years but has experienced very little practical work outside this place&mdash;and he has forgotten. In actual fact, he is the new age silver-spooner&mdash;a silver-spooner made on the backs of Australian taxpayers. He offers us the bread and circuses act, including the republic, while Australian families are struggling, a million people are out of work and another million are not getting as much work as they would like to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, of course, continues to try to convince the journalists of the press gallery that issues like the republic are more important than the basic economics of this country. As he continues on this path, he just demonstrates his boredom with the hard work of proper economic management. We have the Prime Minister and the government demanding more from working people. Only last week, we had an example of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) refusing to confirm that pensioners will have free banking services when the Commonwealth Bank is sold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand they do, Parliamentary Secretary. The Treasurer said that he could not guarantee that pensioners would keep their free banking service. He said that it was up to the bank to decide. But this is the changing face of Labor. It promised but a short period ago that it would not sell the Commonwealth Bank. That was one of the icons and this was the act of faith, written and created in Labor blood, no doubt those opposite would have said. But Labor dropped pensioners just like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that you have to keep repeating things in this place and outside to make sure the message gets through, and I intend to do that until election day. The Treasurer said that Labor's policy had changed. A lot of Labor policies change, don't they? Even the maternity allowance is another broken Labor promise. Labor delivered only half of the maternity allowance which was originally promised. The Prime Minister pledged to deliver at least $1,800; what we ended up with was $814. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government changed the rent assistance. The Australian Council of Social Service has estimated that up to 365,000 households will be worse off by the changes to rent assistance. ACOSS has pointed out that the people paying the lowest rent&mdash;usually the poorest families&mdash;will become ineligible for rent assistance. At the same time, the government will give more rent assistance to people paying higher rents&mdash;usually people on higher incomes. ACOSS has now questioned `the government's commitment to provide improved housing affordability'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the increase in rent assistance will not take place until March 1996. Is that another signpost of the election date? Certainly, it is yet another example of the Prime Minister's method of promises. More and more promises have been set for a couple of years down the track. They are the ones that the government might keep. The Prime Minister is hoping that, by the time we get there, we will have forgotten what the promise was or the circumstances would have changed so much that he would be justified in breaking those promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government has also decided to delay the $2 increase in the guardian allowance. This will not be paid until September 1996. I mention all these things because the bill before us now is about giving a fair wage to all Australians. All of these things impact on that fair wage and a fair income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the guardian allowance and make two points&mdash;firstly, the $2 rise is inadequate and, secondly, as ACOSS has signalled, the delay is indefensible. Why will this rise not be introduced in September this year? The $2 rise is paltry enough but, when you have to wait for over a year to get it, you begin to realise what a pathetic social policy Labor has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing we must investigate when looking at the federal government's record on low income earners is the Accord. I remind the House that the coalition is in fact the representative of the majority of low income earners in Australia. That is a proven fact. Accord Mark VIII was announced last week. As our shadow industrial relations minister pointed out, the Accord Mark VIII will mean real wage cuts for low income earners. A person on the lowest award rate who received the accord safety net increases and has to make superannuation contributions in 1998 will be $8.25 a week worse off. That is what the ACTU and the federal government have cobbled together&mdash;a deal which makes things worse for low income earners. The following statement was made in the House last week:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a philosophy! What a view of life! He is saying, `Here I am. I've spent 20-odd years in parliament, and my main objective is to grind the low paid and those on modest outcomes . . . out of the award protections&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote by the Prime Minister about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), but he could easily have been describing himself. In truth, the Prime Minister is no longer interested in representing low income working people. With the help of the ACTU, he has developed an accord agreement which suits him politically but has little benefits for low income earners. After 25 years in parliament, what has he done for working people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today seeks to introduce measures announced in the federal budget which affect families. I have spoken about the maternity allowance and the fraud contained within that. I should also point out that the coalition improved the structure of the maternity allowance. The coalition made an amendment to ensure that the maternity allowance would also be paid to non-working mothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also seeks to amalgamate the basic and additional family payments. The Department of Social Security said that this will make the payments easier for people to understand. It is true that the social security payment system is complicated, with new allowances and different names for benefits popping up every year. People are becoming very frustrated and confused. But new names for old payments are part of this government's publicity machine. The government thinks that, by giving a payment a new name, it will be seen to be taking some action. This government introduced the present two-tiered family payment system in the first place. Now it is simply going back to the old system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders when this government will make up its mind and stick to a policy, for a change. The people of my electorate are not satisfied with what this government has done to the social security system, nor what it has done for low income families. During a decade of Labor government, Grey has been a neglected region. Unemployment remains above the national average and, as I said earlier, Grey is one of the lowest income electorates in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the government that the coalition represents 75 per cent of the very low income electorates in this country. This is despite the fact that Grey has one of the highest numbers of self-employed people and small businesses. We all know how much assistance this government gives to small business, so it comes as no surprise that Grey is still struggling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes contained in this bill are purely cosmetic tucks. They tinker at the edges and make promises that will not be fulfilled until next year&mdash;if they are fulfilled at all. Going on its past record, we know it is highly unlikely this government will stick to all the promises contained in this bill, and that is the sad thing for low income Australians&mdash;the Australians whom Keating and Labor have abandoned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) was going to give us another history of the demographics of his own particular seat, but he did not even use his full 20 minutes to tell us about the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill. I say to the honourable member for Grey&mdash;seeing he was the last speaker on behalf of the coalition&mdash;that, while we acknowledge that geographically the seat of Grey probably takes in the equivalent of the total land content of New South Wales, it does consist of one seat. I am not doubting the type of job the member has to do with that distance to cover. Although the seat of Grey takes in the equivalent of the total land content of New South Wales, he would have to acknowledge that the state of New South Wales has some 50 seats and a population of nearly seven million. So when we look at statistics we must compare figures at least on a per capita basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to another remark of the member of Grey&mdash;as he was the last speaker in the debate from the coalition&mdash;and I will come to the other speakers who have made contributions to the debate. I remind him that one of the points that has been so eloquently demonstrated at question time this week by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), our Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and our Treasurer (Mr Willis) is the consideration expected to be given to the budget in the Senate. Since the member for Grey mentioned what we have said in question time, I would refer him to the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror </EMPHASIS>today which shows very clearly what this government has been about as far as the Senate is concerned. I will read part of this article into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate is allowed to dictate Government policy, the very sovereignty of Parliament is compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate has any worthwhile function at all (and even that is open to question) it is to scrutinise legislation, and identify unanticipated consequences of legislative change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its function is specifically limited, for good reason, in the Constitution. It was envisaged by those who framed that foundation document as a chamber of secondary importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators should understand that historical position. If they attempt to direct the elected Government's economic policy, they exceed their authority to a dangerous degree.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anyone could have said it better. Those are not my words; they are the words of this morning's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>. I would advise all honourable members and senators to read the article. It explains in great detail how information has been evolving this week in question time for the coalition which controls certain numbers in the Senate. But, if we are looking at legislative reform and change, we find that the coalition is being dictated to by both the Greens and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me back to the bill. We have had seven contributions to this second reading debate. They were from the honourable members for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), Moreton (Mr Gibson), Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), McPherson (Mr Bradford), Franklin (Mr Quick) and Grey. When I first looked at the bill I thought it was a very simple explanatory bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition refers to us in government as not caring about the family. The family is referred to right through the explanatory memorandum. To see that, one does not have to go past the first couple of pages. It discusses the maternity allowance and amalgamating the basic family payment. The family comes into it again. It discusses the income and assets levels and the indexation arrangements for family payment and Austudy&mdash;the family again coming into it&mdash;the increased responsiveness of the family payment income test and the payment of family payment to the primary carer. Each part of the legislation before the House deals with families; yet we have to listen to the opposition's rhetoric stating that this Labor government knows nothing about families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not understand and does not seem to appreciate the fact that this government is about supplying, on a safety net basis, security to families in their time of need. That has always been our policy and that is why the structure of the social security legislation has been put in place in the way it has. That means that changes must come through with legislation and, most particularly, that any changes we wish to implement have full and open debate. There is nothing underhanded, there is nothing we have ever shied away from, nor is there anything we have put under the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go even one step further. The honourable member for Berowra came into this House and I thought, `They are going to support the bill.' But what do we get? We get this spurious amendment moved to the second reading motion denying all words after `that'&mdash;we see the usual drafting&mdash;`and substituting the following words'. In listening to the debate I tried to reason what the opposition could possibly see that was offensive in the measures this government has implemented, with fair warning, such as the maternity allowance and the basic family payment amalgamation. I then realised that the opposition is not really offended by the bill; it is offended by the fact that the people of Australia out there in voterland have overwhelmingly accepted the fundamental arguments in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have an amendment of the type in the bill before the House because the opposition is now starting to acknowledge the thoughts coming through very clearly from the people of Australia, particularly those who are being serviced by social security and those who are now receiving this wonderful document which was produced by the Department of Social Security and was mailed out by the minister, supplying the information to all families which have any payment whatsoever. It is an excellent document and it is being so well received that the coalition is using any vehicle, any avenue, to provide the types of comments that it is wont to put forward&mdash;repetitious bleating about how bad we are and how good it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to criticise someone who puts up policy, but at least we have policy. It is very difficult to criticise someone who has nothing, because half of nothing is still nothing. When opposition members come into this House with some decent policy, we will be able to compare them and us. At the moment we can only compare their previous track record. I will not go back over those years, but I will say that this document is being accepted out in the community. It clearly describes to all and sundry how clearly, how succinctly and how wonderfully the Department of Social Security is able to provide monetary assistance to those in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time available to me I will cover some of the comments that honourable members made during the debate which I believe should be remarked upon. The honourable member for Berowra and a couple of other opposition members who followed him&mdash;it was like a clone effect; you start with a parrot and then you have all the other parrots sitting up in the trees just taking it from there&mdash;started to talk about what we have not done, the measures we are not going to implement in this budget, and that we will not bring this in until 1996, we will not do this until September and we will not do this until July. I remind him and all members of the coalition that, when a budget is introduced, it has a long lead time. That has always been the case. It is no different for us now with the 1995-96 budget. In fact some of the measures in one of the bills in the Senate now awaiting debate is following through amendments and changes to social security that were required under the 1993-94 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in these guidelines&mdash;and this has been explained to the shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Berowra, time and time again&mdash;we are implementing what we can as quickly as we can; we are drafting legislation, including the bills that are in the Senate, which we do not seem to be getting back, so we can put them into effect. I assure him, as I have assured other members&mdash;and I repeated this in the second reading speech I gave yesterday in this House&mdash;there are a number of other measures which have to be implemented from the budget. They will continue to be implemented and, most importantly, we will make sure that they are. The maternity allowance seems to be the concern of the opposition because we are paying it to low and middle income families, and we are paying it because we recognise the costs associated with having a child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern raised by him was the amalgamation of family payments. I again refer the member for Berowra to the explanatory memorandum and also to the basic information that was supplied to him when he asked for different briefings on this particular bill. We are saying that at present the family payment has two components, both the basic family payment and the additional family payment allowance. Again, we have found that these differences have contributed to confusion among our customers about their entitlements. I say repeatedly when I debate social security legislation in this House and in the Main Committee that what we are about is legislation, people's legislation. What we are about is meeting the needs of the community but most particularly listening to what people have to say. Nothing is set in concrete, nor should it be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have a safety net effect in social security and, most particularly, if we are to have legislation that affects those people, we must also be flexible enough to listen to people and to change to address their concerns. That is what we are doing. We have listened and we have said that, if a person is entitled to the basic family payment, we should be able to amalgamate the other family payment as well and have more clear and concise entitlements so there is less confusion and we make sure that people who are entitled get their just desserts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra referred to what we are doing with rent assistance and also the guardian allowance, even though those are not in the bill. It was very clearly spelt out to him both in advice and through our budget documentation that we are going to implement them. They will be coming in with the next piece of social security legislation or the one after that when we have reference to bills in the House. As the budget documents stated, one of those measures will come in in March 1996 and will be followed up with the other in September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch very briefly on other areas. In the echo type mentality of those opposite, there was much reference again to `he said, therefore I say' and `he says it and therefore they say it'. That was drawing on the line of poverty. A document was referred to in a matter of public importance debated last week, when the honourable member for Berowra raised this issue. I believe it was covered very succinctly, but perhaps I should remind those opposite, because reference was made to this so-called document and how dreadful this government has been in the years it has been in office, that the data collected in Queensland by the Australian Bureau of Statistics related to the period extending from 1981 to 1990. I repeat: it was collected in Queensland. When was the Goss government elected in Queensland? In 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">References right through this document acknowledge the fact that, after at least 30 years of National Party government in Queensland, that state had reached a point of almost no return until finally the Goss government was elected. That state is being turned around because of that but most particularly because of the input of the federal government in creating and having in place that safety net. I also refer all members, particularly the honourable member for Berowra, to page 9 of the document, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The data used in this study are the most recent and accessible material available. However, the income data used in this section was based on 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA>I also wish to quote another part of the document. If we are to use the document as a guideline in the debate when most members of the House have not even read it, we also have to draw people's attention to certain aspects of it. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poverty rate for single aged pensioners almost trebled in the period 1981-82&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>under a Queensland National Party government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate the point that the Labor Party was elected in Queensland in 1989, yet the statistics I referred to very clearly state that almost all poverty rates increased in the period 1982 to 1990. The Goss Labor government was elected in 1989. A new government has a great deal of difficulty in implementing changes when it comes in on somebody else's budget. It should be given at least 12 months to two years to bring down its own budgets and to see the effects from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report and others have been used in the debate quite, I believe, spuriously by opposition members to support their arguments before the House. Most particularly, statistics have been quoted in the debate to try to identify what those opposite perceive to be an area of concern. This clearly shows that when you have nothing to offer you grab whatever you can. I and everybody else know full well that the worth of the contributions of opposition members, when they try to pull this sort of thing, is lower than zilch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), when he gave a reply to that matter of public importance last week, more than ably handled the concerns. I suggest that those speakers who participated in the debate on behalf of the coalition refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 21 June. I will not repeat it. The statistics are all there. It was very aptly put into place. They are the facts, not the fiction nor the hyperbole that we have had to listen to from opposition members in their contributions to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I found the speech made yesterday by the member for Cowan rather enlightening. He started to tell us what is going to happen on 1 July. He was not being relevant to the bill and the Deputy Speaker called him to order. I say to the member for Cowan that we all know what is going to happen on 1 July. On 1 July 1995, a low income renting family with one child under six years of age will be entitled to a basic payment of $10.85, an additional family payment of $33.60, a parenting allowance of $31.95 and rent assistance of $38.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 July the average family&mdash;the people he purports to represent&mdash;will, because of this government's policies, have an extra $114.90 in their pockets every week because of the safety net structure we have put in place in the social security legislation. I reiterate: the safety net is in place for families in their time of need. It acknowledges and caters for families in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowan also commented on mothers at home. I would remind him and others in the coalition that through the home child-care allowance, the parenting allowance and additional family payments the government pays a total of some $4 billion to families throughout Australia. That is being paid to spouses in two-parent families with children. But this does not include the extra expenditure on basic family payment, which those families will also receive, nor does it include the additional expenditure that will result from the budget measures we are now implementing&mdash;all of which will benefit families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowan had great delight in saying that we are not looking after mothers who are staying at home. In addition to the figure I have just mentioned&mdash;that is, some $4 billion being paid to families, plus a variety of other family measures coming out of the budget&mdash;some $830 million is paid as subsidies for fee relief or as a rebate for work related child care. That is the difference between the opposition and the government. We have tried to implement&mdash;and we continue to do so&mdash;child-care policies that are associated with work related objectives. We are there to make sure that when mothers and fathers choose to go to work their children are being minded adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took great offence at what the member for McPherson said yesterday. I do not know why I do. I know that the member for McPherson often says that I get under his skin. I listened to his speech yesterday&mdash;and I know I hear it time and time again, so I really should not be surprised&mdash;and could not help wondering what tree he fell out of. He implied that women belong in labour wards. I remind him that, in over 200 years of white settlement in this country, women have contributed a great deal more to this country than by just lining up in the labour wards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also remind him that, since the beginning of history, women have contributed&mdash;and will continue to contribute&mdash;a lot more than just by lining up in the labour wards. We know that biologically we may be different but, God willing, we have been given a brain. When are we going to get past people thinking that we have to go back to the day of the family when the wife stays at home, that the roles of men and women are not interchangeable, and that we only have to visit a labour ward in a hospital to realise that? I thought Noah and the ark had well and truly landed in a biblical sense. Quite frankly, the world has acknowledged and accepted that women are here&mdash;in Australia we make up some 54 per cent of this population&mdash;to contribute a lot more than that. It is belittling and demeaning that it is being said in debate that women are being paid a maternity allowance and that they should stay in the labour wards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has clearly demonstrated that we are committed to alleviate both inequality and poverty. We have put in place significant social changes so that we can assist in that regard. Since we have been in government there has been a real increase of some 12 per cent in the basic pension rate, a real increase of some 150 per cent in payments for children, and increases in the payment to private renters of between 75 per cent and 135 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the recent publicity surrounding the estimates of the rich and the poor in Australia&mdash;using Queensland as a comparison. However, we have seen reports which, time and time again, praise the government for what it is doing with jobs, employment, employment growth and, most particularly, the changes to the structure of social security. This is, finally, being accepted by the people of Australia, even though it is very seldom acknowledged by the opposition in any social security debate in this House. Those opposite are concerned because members of the community are starting to realise that they are being helped when they are in need and that their dollar is going further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been done in more than one way, and that is the true basis of the opposition's concern, and thus the Senate's concern, with the budget that has been brought down by this government. It is a good budget and it is a budget that will be implemented because it has been accepted in total by the people of Australia. The opposition has put up an amendment to an excellent piece of legislation which is required by people out in the community and by the women in families, in particular, and which we have now implemented because it was a commitment we gave in the budget. The legislation will go through because the people out there are saying, `We want it. The government has listened to us. The changes to social security are what we have asked for. It is something we will have.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the honourable member for Berowra came into the House, leading for the coalition, but really had little to say about the bill. Members of the coalition cannot stand up and say, `Congratulations; well done.' They say, `Wait a minute. We think you are neglecting the welfare of families. We had better move an amendment to a bill. We are not going to stop you having a second reading, but we are going to make sure that at least we put some critical voice forward.' I understand that the opposition sees that as its role. I perceive the role of the opposition to be to make sure that it comes up at times as an alternative government. At the moment it has not done so; it is unable to. It cannot ever put itself forward as an alternative government unless it formulates policy. If it cannot formulate policy it will never get acceptance. Without acceptance it will not get votes. Without votes it will not win government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I can see us for many terms to come sitting on this side of the House and you sitting on that side of the House. We will be having similar debates on social security as we have had here in the last day and a half because what we are about is constant change. What we as government are about is listening to the people. I commend the bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The best way to protect and enhance the human rights of Australians often instigates a lively debate. This debate generally centres on whether the current system of rights protection is adequate or should be supplemented by further legislative measures such as a bill of rights. Australia is unusual amongst Western democracies in not having some form of express bill or charter of rights. The Australian system in contrast rests on an amalgam of common law, some limited, express and implied constitutional freedoms and specific anti-discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe a strong case can be made for a bill of rights. However, many argue that the current mix of common law and legislation is the best way to advance the rights of individual Australians. Whatever the rights or wrongs of that argument, the fact is that our system depends on effective anti-discrimination legislation. This legislation is predicated on the Australian belief that every individual should be judged according to their merits and abilities and not on preconceived prejudices or stereotypes held by others. Hence our anti-discrimination legislation does not set out to mandate so-called positive discrimination in favour of a particular group or person, but rather operates on the basis that barriers built on prejudice and unfairness should be pulled down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's anti-discrimination legislation&mdash;the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act&mdash;are fundamentally concerned with providing remedies to those individuals who suffer discrimination in the public sphere. It is legislation based on the merit principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Act is the second of the Commonwealth's specific human rights measures. Enacted in 1984, the parliamentary debate which accompanied its passage was one of the most extensive in the parliament's history. It is important that legislation of this kind be reviewed and, if necessary, revised to ensure its continued effectiveness measured against the benchmarks set by the practical usage of the remedies and changing social conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, released in April 1992, made a number of recommendations for amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. A response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 19 September 1992 and tabled in the parliament on 7 October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister announced a staged implementation process for the recommendations in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> dealing with the Sex Discrimination Act. The first stage was completed with the passage of the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act in December 1992. This legislation included, inter alia, changes to the sexual harassment provisions. Additionally, the act was amended by legislation which came into force on 13 January 1993, making it unlawful to dismiss an employee on the ground of family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill comprises the second stage. The third and final stage of the implementation process will examine some of the permanent exemptions currently contained in the Sex Discrimination Act. It will also consider whether to make explicit in the act that discrimination on the ground of the identity or occupation of a person's spouse is unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage of implementation of the committee's recommendations was commenced in October 1992 when discussion papers were issued, setting out a number of proposals to amend the act. In summary, these amendments introduce a general prohibition on discrimination and an equality before the law provision into the new preamble of the act. They make it clear that it is unlawful to discriminate on the ground of potential pregnancy and remove the reasonableness test for direct discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. They amend the act to bring it into line with Australian Defence Force policy relating to the deployment of women in combat related duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the bill sets out a simpler definition of indirect discrimination and provides respondents with a defence of reasonableness in answer to claims of indirect discrimination. The bill also provides for a new approach to special measures by moving and revising the existing provisions to reflect the positive role of special measures in the achievement of equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said when he announced the stage 2 proposals, `ground breaking legislation always brings out the high emotions in those who want to remain locked in the closets of the past'. This was the case with the Sex Discrimination Act 11 years ago, and it remains to some extent the case today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the passage of the act, there have been significant changes in the position of Australian women. In particular, women's involvement in paid employment continues to grow. By 1994, 52 per cent of Australian women participated in the paid labour force, and women now make up 42 per cent of employees. Participation in senior secondary and tertiary education has improved markedly, with the school retention rate for women rising by 40 per cent between 1983 and 1993. Today 53 per cent of higher education students are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these advances, however, there is an abundance of evidence showing that women still suffer inequality in society, illustrating the need for this legislation and these amendments. Women's total earnings, including ordinary and overtime, are still only 84 per cent of those of men for full-time workers. Women continue to be over-represented in part-time and casual employment, both characterised by more limited access to benefits such as training, leave entitlements and superannuation. There still exists a high degree of gender segregation in the work force&mdash;with approximately 55 per cent of all employed women working as clerical, sales or service workers. The lack of female participation in non-traditional areas such as science, engineering and technology also continues. In 1993, for example, women comprised only 13 per cent of engineering students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> committee noted the low levels of representation of women in upper management positions, and this remains an issue today. As women progress in their careers, the barriers and limitations encapsulated in the phrase `the glass ceiling' become more apparent. In the private sector, women still represent only about one per cent of executive directors and four per cent of non-executive directors. These employment disparities are not simply issues that affect high income or professional workers. The proportion of female apprentices in all fields has changed only slightly since 1986. Male apprentices outnumber female apprentices in all trades except hairdressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> committee observed that, while cases of overt, direct discrimination still continue, it is indirect discrimination which contributes more significantly to the existence of the glass ceiling. The effects of these hidden restrictions on women are not only individually unfair but also detrimental to Australian enterprise and Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to continue to lose the skills, experience, energy and talent of half our population. Just as cabinet has recognised that we need more women on Commonwealth boards, and political parties recognise that we need more women in government, so too do business, industry, science, the law and academia all need to continue the steps they are taking to improve the opportunities for women in their respective fields. The ongoing difficulties facing women in the work force counter the argument that there is no need for this legislation or for these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents of the bill also appear to be arguing that this bill paves the way for the government to abandon merit based approaches and introduce quotas in employment. Those views reflect both a misunderstanding of the contents of this bill and a failure to appreciate the crucial differences between the path taken here in Australia on employment discrimination, and that adopted in other countries such as the United States. Only last Sunday Don Chipp in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> made the claim that in Australia `employers can be forced to employ a female worker to accord with "affirmative action" even though a woman would not be suitable for the vacancy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such claims are simply wrong. Unlike the United States, we have not adopted employment quotas in Australia but have worked with employers to plan for and improve the levels of employment of women and eliminate rules and practices which may unfairly disadvantage women. The aim is to break down the barriers to appointment and promotion on merit. In both private and public sector affirmative action and equal employment opportunity programs, the principle of merit is the premise upon which selection, promotion and transfer decisions are, and should be, made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not change that approach. There is no requirement in Commonwealth legislation for quotas. The second reading speech for the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act specifically stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's affirmative action legislation does not propose positive discrimination or reverse discrimination. We are totally opposed to the use of quotas, and this legislation, by stating that all actions are to be based on merit, makes this clear.</PARA>
<PARA>I will now turn to the provisions of this bill amending the Sex Discrimination Act. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum. Submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs expressed concern about the absence from the act, and indeed Australian law, of a general prohibition against discrimination. For this reason, the government proposes to insert a preamble in the act incorporating a general prohibition on discrimination and an equality before the law provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble makes a strong statement that it is a basic human right to live free from discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy. The preamble also proclaims the equality before the law of all individuals, emphasising the fundamental right that all persons, regardless of their sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, will be treated equally by the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wording of this paragraph reflects the need to consider the principle of equality in law by looking at the effects of a law in its entire social context. The statement in the preamble that everyone has the right to the `equal protection and equal benefit of the law' is not to suggest that a simplistic approach of always applying the same rules to every group is necessarily the best way to ensure that equality is effectively achieved. The `equality before the law' preamble paragraph is not intended to preclude or undermine acts taken for the purpose of overcoming inequality or disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some commentators have suggested that Australia should take further steps in this area, enacting equality legislation. I welcome the discussion and debate which is now occurring on that issue in response to the recommendations recently made by the Australian Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important protection provided for by this bill relates to pregnant women and women who are discriminated against on the basis that they are seen as likely to become pregnant. Currently the act provides a defence of reasonableness to a person who directly discriminates on the ground of pregnancy. Apart from the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Act 1984, no other Australian jurisdiction provides this defence. The current `reasonableness defence' unnecessarily weakens the protection provided against direct discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. For these reasons, this defence will be removed from the legislation, in accordance with the committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, some work poses an identifiable risk to a pregnant employee, it will remain open to the employer to discuss the situation with the employee and agree on appropriate action, or an employer can apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, for an administrative exemption. Although the likelihood of pregnancy may already fall within the definition of sex discrimination within the act&mdash;as a characteristic imputed to women&mdash;the government believes that it is desirable for the situation to be clear and unambiguous. For this reason we are including potential pregnancy as a ground upon which a complaint may be made under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the definition covers situations in which it is perceived or assumed that a woman is likely to become pregnant. In these situations, it is not uncommon for a woman to be denied the opportunity to advance in her career because of a perception that she will be less committed to her job. It is these sorts of assumptions about women which operate to prevent them from achieving their potential. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Indirect discrimination</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major reform made by this bill is the change to the indirect discrimination provisions of the act, which have proven complicated and difficult to apply in practice and which have been criticised for being overly technical, legalistic and complex. Tackling indirect discrimination is essential because barriers to equality are often the result of the application of practices, conditions or requirements which appear to be neutral but which in fact impact adversely on members of a particular group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Direct discrimination focuses on different treatment where one person is treated less favourably than another on the basis of an attribute such as sex or marital status, for example, where a woman is denied a promotion simply because she is a woman. Indirect discrimination is considerably more difficult to identify. It occurs when policies and practices which might appear to be fair and neutral are in fact quite discriminatory in their impact, resulting in an outcome which disadvantages persons of a particular group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, if a job requirement specifies a minimum number of years work experience in a particular field and the field is one which has until recently been closed to women, then women applicants are up against a barrier which is not necessarily based on merit. The effect of indirect discrimination has been likened to `built-in head winds', a description which aptly conveys the difficulties confronting, for example, women facing employment selection criteria which embody inherently more burdensome requirements for women than for men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Submissions to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equa</EMPHASIS>l committee and to the ALRC under its reference `Equality before the law' were critical of the existing test and particularly critical of the requirement that the complainant has to prove that the requirement or condition imposed by the respondent is unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill sets out a simpler definition of indirect discrimination. It provides that a person discriminates against another person if the discriminator imposes or proposes to impose a condition, requirement or practice that has or is likely to have the effect of disadvantaging the person discriminated against because of, for example, his or her sex. The focus is on broad patterns of behaviour which adversely affect people who are members of a particular group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives respondents a defence of reasonableness against claims of indirect discrimination, providing that a condition, requirement or practice does not constitute discrimination if it is reasonable in the circumstances. The bill sets out matters which ought to be taken into account in deciding whether a condition, requirement or practice is reasonable. Assessing reasonableness will involve looking at the nature and extent of the disadvantage to the people affected by the requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also involve considering the feasibility of the discriminator overcoming or mitigating the disadvantage, for example, by reviewing whether there were alternative non-discriminatory or less discriminatory means available which would achieve the same purpose. Costs, business efficiency and business needs might be relevant factors for consideration. The disadvantage to those affected by the requirement will be measured against the result sought by the person imposing the condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters specified for consideration as to whether a condition is reasonable are based on the provisions in the anti-discrimination legislation of the Australian Capital Territory. They are not intended to be an exhaustive list. They are intended to provide guidance to the courts and the parties about the variety and type of factors which will be relevant in any specific situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some opponents of this bill object to the fact that, after these amendments, it will be the respondent who faces the task of showing that a discriminatory condition or practice is reasonable. In fact, it is far more appropriate for respondents to be expected to prove that a condition or practice is reasonable than for complainants to be expected to prove that it is not reasonable, since the relevant information or reasons for imposing the condition will be within the knowledge of the respondent&mdash;the person or corporation imposing the condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, an employer who imposes a condition may have taken into account matters such as financial considerations affecting the workplace as a whole&mdash;matters about which a complainant may have no knowledge. It does not make sense to expect a complainant to second guess the respondent's reasons for the discriminatory practice imposed by the respondent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, requiring a complainant to show that a condition or practice is not reasonable could have the result that the complainant undertakes a fishing expedition, seeking extensive document production in the hope that an explanation of the reasons for the imposition of the condition will be unearthed. Such practices would, of course, add to the length and costs of litigation for both parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing a `reasonableness defence' for respondents is consistent with the approach adopted in recent anti-discrimination legislation in the Australian Capital Territory and in Queensland as well as overseas jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and Canada.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also recognises and embodies another important step which has been taken towards eliminating discrimination within our defence forces. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> committee recommended that section 43 of the Sex Discrimination Act be amended to include a specified time period not exceeding two years to allow the removal of prohibitive and discriminatory provisions from Defence Force legislative requirements and administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 43 of the act provides that it is not unlawful for a person to discriminate against a woman on the ground of her sex in connection with employment, engagement or appointment in the Defence Force in a position involving performance of combat duties or combat related duties. The combat related duties exclusion has not been applied since May 1990 when the chiefs of staff recommended against its continued application and the then Minister for Defence announced a new policy based on this advice. On 18 December 1992 the Minister for Defence announced that women may serve in all army, navy and air force units, except direct combat units. As the exemption from the act in relation to combat related duties is no longer applicable, section 43 will be amended to reflect this change. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Special measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue raised by both the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> committee and by the Australian Law Reform Commission under its reference `Equality before the law' is whether the `special measures' provision in the act as presently worded is achieving its purpose. The legislation currently provides that an act which would otherwise be discriminatory for the purposes of the act is not unlawful if a purpose of that act is to ensure equal opportunity. The legislation currently treats special measures as discriminatory, but lawful&mdash;an approach which reflects the fact that the legislation is structured on an `equal treatment' model under which any difference in treatment is prima facie discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed in the bill makes two significant changes. First, it provides that special measures are not treated as a form of discrimination; instead, they would be considered as part of the threshold question of whether there is discrimination at all. Consequently, the `special measures' provision will be moved from that part of the act which provides exemptions. Special measures should be presented and understood as an expression of equality rather than an exception to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the special measures provision currently focuses on the attainment of equal opportunities. This focus ignores the historical and structural barriers which impede women's utilisation of formal equal opportunities. The Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women refers to measures `aimed at accelerating defacto equality', and our emphasis should be on measures to achieve real or substantive equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To attain substantive equality, it is necessary to look at the end result of a practice that purports to treat people equally. In this way structural barriers that prevent a disadvantaged group from attaining real equality can be taken into account. A narrow and formalistic interpretation of equality will not produce equality in fact and may entrench existing discrimination or create new discriminatory situations. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments introduce important reforms in our sex discrimination laws. While they may result in some cost implications for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, any additional resources for the commission will be considered in the context of the current review of the HREOC. The government is confident that these amendments will strengthen the Sex Discrimination Act in line with our commitment to work towards the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995, and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) just completed his second reading speech on the bill. It has been acknowledged that this bill seeks to implement the second part of the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the nature of the speech given by the Attorney. I would like to commend him on his speech. He has demonstrated his interest in this subject. I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when it initially inquired into this area, but I was no longer a member when it completed its work. I note that it did so in the 36th parliament when the Attorney was the chairman of the committee and also the chairman of the status of women subcommittee. His interest in this matter and his record are acknowledged. It is a matter on which he has demonstrated views and a commitment for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting that, in the commencement of his speech, he made some comments about the nature of sex discrimination in Australia which I found particularly illuminating. He relied, as heavily as he usually does, upon the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to the implementation of his proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Prime Minister is one of those people in this parliament whose record is clear. His views have shown a good deal of maturing over time. If we were still to be guided by the views that the Prime Minister held 20 years ago, we would see that he was steeped in the views of the past. I notice that the Prime Minister, by his recent statements, does not want to be judged by his views of the past, but all too often he is keen to saddle others with the views that they may have held at earlier points in time. I would like to think that he was able to show the same agility and understanding in relation to others changing their views that he wants people to use in accommodating his own record of changing views. I do accommodate the change in views of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, in the speech of the Attorney, a considerable emphasis is put on the extent to which there remains in our community barriers to entry, which need to be addressed. I would certainly acknowledge that, if effective barriers to entry remain, they ought to be addressed. The Attorney looked at issues relating to women's earnings and I wish to draw the attention of the House to one part of his speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women's total earnings (including ordinary and overtime) are still only 84% of men's for full time workers. Women continue to be over represented in part time and casual employment, both characterised by more limited access to benefits such as training, leave entitlements and superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it not interesting that an emphasis on women's earnings is placed in this legislation but, in other areas in which I carry responsibility to monitor the government's views, the government seems to take a slightly different approach? For instance, in the social security area, the government has moved over time to raise the retirement age of women from 60 to 65, at which age eligibility for age pension benefits can be founded. When the government was arguing against that proposition before the last election, it did so on the basis of adopting these views that the Attorney-General has put today. It said that women have suffered a significant disadvantage which has not been addressed and therefore they need to have an earlier retirement age; ergo, suggestions that you should change it were wrong in principle and would be opposed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as the election was over, that matter seemed to be of less weight in the government's view. It then sought to implement the very proposition that it had criticised, presumably on the basis that there had been a change in the situation maybe over a matter of months or so. I suspect that was not the case. No doubt the incongruity between the Attorney-General's views as expressed here and the government's changes in the social security area will be noted by those who take an interest in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Attorney-General went on to talk about indirect discrimination, a matter which I will address in my comments on this bill and a matter on which the Attorney-General spent a good deal of his own time in the second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is indirect discrimination which contributes more significantly to the existence of the glass ceiling. The effects of these hidden restrictions on women are not only individually unfair, they are detrimental to Australian enterprise and Australia's international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Attorney-General is suggesting that, therefore, we need to take some further steps. He went on to acknowledge the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford to continue to lose the skills, experience, energy and talent of half of our population. Just as cabinet has recognised that we need more women on Commonwealth boards, and political parties recognise that we need more women in government, so too do business, industry, science, the law, and academia, all need to continue the steps they are taking to improve opportunities for women in their respective fields.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that he commented on the views of political parties and expressed it in that bipartisan way. I welcome that. One of the areas which he does not allude to directly&mdash;but perhaps he did by speaking of women in government&mdash;is that a good deal of attention has been paid to the steps that political parties are taking to address the inadequate representation of women in the parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government that has moved to adopt certain methods in its own political party to prescribe a certain number of places that might be filled by women. It is the opposition that has said it does not like that prescriptive approach. We think that one ought to address the issue by encouraging people to seek out opportunities, that people should be judged on their merits and accorded opportunities on the basis of their abilities to contribute in the parliamentary arena. When you look at the performance of both the government and the opposition in this matter&mdash;where one has adopted a prescriptive approach and the other has not&mdash;the end outcome is not substantially different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a point that needs to be understood when we come to debate some of the issues that are contained in this legislation because, so far as the opposition is concerned, we believe in equality of opportunity. We want to see the changes that have been occurring in Australia continue. We want to see them continued by encouragement and by leadership. But we do have doubts about some of the more prescriptive steps that the government seeks to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the bill and the several matters that it addresses. The explanatory memorandum outlines the following amendments: first, the bill inserts a preamble incorporating both a general prohibition on discrimination on the grounds covered by the act and an equality before the law provision; second, it simplifies the test for indirect discrimination, clarifies the meaning of indirect discrimination and provides a defence to the respondent if the respondent can satisfy all the elements of the defence including that the condition, requirement or practice imposed is reasonable in the circumstances; third, it includes potential pregnancy as an unlawful ground of discrimination and removes the reasonableness test for direct discrimination on the ground of pregnancy; fourth, it replaces the special measures provision with a new provision that says that such measures do not amount to discrimination for the purposes of the act; fifth, it removes the reference to combat related duties in Australian Defence Force's exemption; and, sixth, it makes some minor technical and consequential amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that the opposition is particularly concerned about certain aspects of the bill, which I will identify. In the Senate the opposition will refer the provisions of the bill for further examination by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The matters we think should be the subject of further examination include the changes to indirect discrimination provisions where the bill does make a fundamental change that the alleged aggrieved party no longer has the burden of proving that the alleged act of discrimination was not reasonable. We see this as a shift in the burden of proof, as the discriminator must now claim and prove reasonableness as a defence. I will be proposing a second reading amendment in this chamber which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House expresses its concern at the reversal of the onus of the burden of proof which is proposed in the Bill".</PARA>
<PARA>The reversal of the onus of proof was the subject of quite a deal of discussion in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>. I did refresh my memory on this matter. It was dealt with on pages 235 and 238 of the committee's report. The committee indicated that it heard evidence from Ms Helen Styles and Mr John Basten, both experienced in leading Australian cases on indirect discrimination. The report recorded the importance of the concept of indirect discrimination and the widespread interest in achieving a more workable definition. It said something of the United States experience, and indicated that this matter was dealt with in sections 5(2), 6(2) and 7(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The witnesses gave some evidence about the way in which this matter had been dealt with before the federal courts and the New South Wales courts as they had tried to give some meaning to those provisions and similar sections in the New South Wales anti-discrimination act. The committee report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The area of most difficulty identified by the Courts is giving meaning to the second element, namely that the discriminator imposed a condition which is able to be complied with by a substantially higher proportion of persons of the opposite sex to the aggrieved person. The test involves a comparison of proportions and it is how these proportions are derived that can be problematic. The central question is which base pool group of employees should be used for comparative purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to discuss the Australian Iron and Steel v. Banovic case of 1989 and dealt with some other matters involving the Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v. Styles case. Mr Basten gave some strong personal views on that matter, drawing upon his views of the United States situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other evidence was given to the committee by Heather Carmody, the Chief Executive of the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment, representing the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia. She warned that any changes to the reasonableness requirement could be impractical and possibly disadvantage employees. This matter was the subject of a dissenting report, which it behoves me to mention because it was formed after having the benefit of Mr Basten's views as well as Ms Carmody's views in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also some comments in the report about the way in which the committee undertook its deliberations. Some members of the committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dismayed that an inquiry that has taken almost two years and has been the subject of a considerable number of submissions has been hastened to a premature conclusion. The fact that the Sub-committee was accorded just 1 1/2 hours to consider the whole Report demeans Australian women and treats with contempt the process of Parliamentary Committee Inquiry. Only 4 Members of the Government Party attended the final meeting of the Committee. In effect, these four have determined the Committee's recommendations although the actual attendance of Opposition Members at that meeting was greater in number. This meant the Report was approved in effect by four of a total membership of fifteen.</PARA>
<PARA>Some members of the committee did not see it as being truly representative, saw the discussion as being truncated and were of the view&mdash;I think it is germane that this follow the matter I am averting to&mdash;that some of these conclusions, if they had been the subject of further elaboration and discussion, may well have been different. That is one of the reasons I think the Senate examination of these issues might well be propitious. Recommendation 69&mdash;I think it was originally recommendation 70; some error may have been induced by the renumbering of recommendations&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to establish discrimination under Section 5, 6 or 7 on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy, a person must prove, (in addition to proving that the alleged discrimination `requires the aggrieved person to comply with a requirement or condition') that the requirement or condition be one `with which a substantially higher proportion of persons of the opposite sex to the aggrieved person comply or able to comply'; the requirement or condition be `not reasonable' having regard to the circumstances of the case; and the requirement or condition be one `with which the aggrieved person does not or is not able to comply'.</PARA>
<PARA>Members went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this provision is to impose an element of reasonableness in relation to a complaint of discrimination. The 4 Government Party Members of the Committee who attended the final meeting believe this element should be removed from the legislation and replaced with a defence of the least discriminatory course of action.</PARA>
<PARA>They continue:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some circumstances, the rejection of a person of one sex for preferment, although prima facie discriminatory, may be reasonable for social, health or cultural reasons. A male breast feeding counsellor may not be acceptable to some women; a male pool attendant may not be acceptable to Islamic women. Similarly, evidence was given about the health and safety risks to pregnant women in the lead industry. Accordingly, we believe that the element of `reasonableness' should be retained in the legislation. Moreover, we are concerned that recommendation 69&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or recommendation 70, as I interposed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if enacted, involved something less than `reasonableness' which in practice is unlikely to constitute any real defence at all. We recommend that the element of reasonableness be retained in . . . the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>So there was a good deal of discussion of this matter and certainly not a unanimous view. That is still reflected in this debate and in the approach that the opposition is taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the issue of the removal of the reasonableness test from the pregnancy provision. This is another matter we think the Senate committee may well want to review. My colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone, the shadow Attorney, received an opinion on this matter from the Law Council of Australia, which indicated that some matters ought to be further explored. I quote the council's letter to her. Mr Virtue, the deputy secretary-general, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been able to look at the proposed amendments only fairly cursorily, but, on that basis, we do not have any difficulty with them. We did wonder about the removal of the reasonableness defence for a complaint of direct discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. We understand that the thinking behind this relates to the need for consistency (in that there is no similar defence available in relation to the other grounds on which discrimination can be claimed) and also that it is thought to be not appropriate to maintain this defence. It may be that some employers will be concerned about this, but the thinking seems to be that this defence made it too easy for discrimination on the ground of pregnancy to be justified.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Law Council, which is having a bit of an each-way bet, outlined that there were matters of concern that ought to be the subject of further consideration. It is the view of the opposition that that opportunity ought to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter I wish to address is the changes to the special measures provisions. While consultation elicited both support and opposition to this amendment, in our view it requires examination. The provision does not contain any test, such as time limits, or address issues of reviewability and the like. Additionally, a special measure is to be treated as being taken for the purpose of achieving equality if it is taken solely for that purpose or for that purpose as well as another purpose, whether or not that purpose is the dominant or substantial one. The Parliamentary Library's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> on this legislation describes the special measures provision as being designed to allow for situations where exact parity of treatment between different groups cannot eradicate discrimination and that extra steps will be required to facilitate equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, we will be moving an amendment expressing our concerns about the substantial issue of contest regarding the reversal of the onus of the burden of proof.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to speak in the debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill this morning. In my opening remarks I want to quote from Anne Summers' revised edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Damned whores and God's police</EMPHASIS>. In her introduction to the new edition, she talks about the change in attitudes that has taken place in the last 20-odd years. She also refers to the classic work by Germaine Greer. She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Germaine Greer's classic work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Female Eunuch</EMPHASIS> was published in 1970 I was surprised to discover that its salty language presented some difficulties for many women who were otherwise eagerly receptive to its message. I first realized this when I spoke at a seminar on Greer's book held in Sydney in the early 1970s and met a middle-aged woman who confessed that she had covered the book in brown paper and hidden it amongst her shoes because her husband had forbidden her to read it.</PARA>
<PARA>She then went on to talk about the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, for which we are providing amendments in this bill. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years later, Australia's landmark anti-discrimination legislation, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, may have had a less difficult time making its way through parliament had its very title not been seen as so inflammatory. Hysterical critics of the Bill claimed that it would do everything from `denigrate marriage' to `force [women] into a gender-free, unisex society, in which women are locked into the paid labour force for their entire lifetimes just like men (except for brief periods of maternity leave)'.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, there has been a major structural change in Australian society, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said in his second reading speech. There has been a massive increase in the participation of women in the work force. There has also been a commitment by this government to make sure that in those greatly changed economic circumstances for Australian families the rights of all workers, and the particular needs of women workers, are addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very encouraging to see that today there is a large measure of bipartisan support for this bill. It is almost a year since the 10-year celebration of the passing of the Sex Discrimination Act. On that occasion a number of people were reviewing the issue. The current federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Sue Walpole, spoke of this in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 28 July 1994. She indicated that if we look back to 1948 Jesse Street, the only woman on the Australian delegation who saw the establishment of the United Nations, argued strongly for a commission on the status of women to be part of the UN. I quote Jesse Street:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was hardly a sphere of life in which the rights of women had been respected and in which women did not suffer discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA>Sue Walpole goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, women's rights are expected by women as just that, rights.</PARA>
<PARA>Although we have achieved much with the passage of this and related legislation in the past 10 years or so, the report that has been referred to by both the Attorney-General and the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the report of the inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of April 1992&mdash;indicated that much has to be done. Recognising the particular needs of women as they participate in the work force has been crucial. As Sue Walpole says in her report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, issues of equality and discrimination have been included in one of the key structures of Australian society&mdash;the Industrial Relations Act . . . It is our job to ensure that the community is aware of its rights and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge success of the sexual harassment training kits that have been produced by the human rights commission indicates that there is still a large unmet need in this area. In May this year my office distributed 5,000 information kits to employers. The response to this initiative has been overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, work we have been doing with schools and unions has shown the enormous need for information and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>So what we have achieved with this legislation, which will be furthered by the amendments we are debating today, is to enshrine in law and to provide a mechanism where we recognise that behaviour in the workplace which has historically interfered with the ability of men and women to do their jobs effectively because of undue and unfair pressure is able to be resolved. Ms Walpole continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 50,000 Australians have had direct experience of what the Sex Discrimination Act means and has achieved. These are the people who have been complainants, respondents or advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work done by my office has shown that, overwhelmingly, people think the process is fair and nearly a third have instituted long-term change as a consequence. This daily experience is reflected in the faces of women.</PARA>
<PARA>There is often publicity surrounding cases that are taken through the courts or that have achieved some degree of notoriety. There is one such case in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Male members of the McLeod Country Golf Club in Brisbane are currently before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission arguing that they are being discriminated against. I do not propose to comment on the debate that will take place, but the fact that they are able to institute this proceeding indicates that the rights of both men and women are protected under this legislation. My interest is that my mother-in-law was formerly a member of that golf club. I think she would agree with the spokesperson for the golf club who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 300,000 male and 113,000 female golfers in Australia. Some clubs have ensured women are not executive members. The McLeod Country Golf Club was formed in 1968 to redress inequalities for female golfers.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is encouraging, in my view, to see that there is a debate about such matters to look after the rights of both men and women in such organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through these amendments, this bill seeks to incorporate `potential pregnancy' as a new ground for complaints of discrimination, to insert a preamble which sets out the principle of equality, to create a new test for indirect discrimination and to shift the burden of proof to discriminators to establish the reasonableness of their allegedly discriminatory criteria, to incorporate the definition of `special measures' into the definition of `discrimination' in such a manner that special measures will be excluded from the definition of discrimination, and to remove `combat related duties' from the exemptions recognised. From what the member for Berowra has said, his amendment relates to the test for indirect discrimination. I note that some employers have expressed concern about this proposal. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Sheryle Bagwell quoted Mr Ian Spicer from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burden will shift to the employer to disprove the allegations and business, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, will be hard put to come up with resources to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Attorney-General made clear in his second reading speech, this amendment encourages the respondents, who are often in a better position to explain the difficulties that they are faced with and have the resources to do that, to explain and give an account of why such an indirect practice would be reasonable. From the number of complaints brought to the commission on this category, there is an indication that it has actually been very hard for complainants to make those complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have indicated&mdash;and Dr Clare Burton has done a great deal of research in this area&mdash;that, in order to feel you are working without discrimination, many of the taken for granted work practices and conditions in employment often do not directly address those issues that make it very hard for women to compete on an equal footing. This is the perspective that this amendment seeks to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend a bit of time on the defence related amendment to remove combat related duties from exemptions recognised. The Defence Force has already moved on this issue. Following a Senate investigation into harassment reports on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS> in 1992, the Defence Force has done a great deal in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that in such an organisation as the Defence Force, which has a strong history of being a gender segregated workplace, we should not be surprised to see the organisational culture slow to change. The Defence Force itself has made significant changes in its policy direction. Material that refers to the changes indicates that the issue of sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force is one of the major defence personnel issues. Before the Senate Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in the Australian Defence Force had completed its investigation, the Australian Defence Force had instigated an Action Plan to eliminate sexual harassment. The Australian Defence Force is now working towards ensuring that all personnel work in an environment free from any form of harassment or discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minute also refers to the fact that the Defence Force has zero tolerance of sexual harassment, and senior management has a major commitment to this. It is also instructive to note that currently, in the three arms of the Defence Force, most positions are now open to women. Overall, 88 per cent of work categories are open to women. In the navy, 99 per cent of operational positions are open to men and women; in the army, it is 67 per cent of positions; and, in the air force, it is 98 per cent of positions. The only categories that are currently limited are those combat positions which relate to a direct physical encounter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of an article relating to the physical effects on defence personnel of intense training which I think appeared in yesterday's media. The government is aware of the importance for all recruits of the number of injuries that may be part of recruit training. Because of the government's commitment to the welfare of defence personnel it is looking at this issue across the board. I believe that the Defence Force is already moving to address this issue which is of concern to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is instructive to realise that while a great deal has been achieved in this area more still has to be done. I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 July 1994 where Sheryle Bagwell looks back at the achievements of the Sex Discrimination Act. She states in that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a young reporter a decade ago, I recall stories about sexual harassment were considered a joke&mdash;and treated as such by my newspaper's columnists and cartoonists. Today no one is laughing. Not editors. Not employers. Not government ministers&mdash;even police ministers. And it's not because they fear a hefty payout. On the contrary, penalties are tiny in comparison with other areas of the law. It is because sexual harassment is no longer considered acceptable conduct by the society in which we live.</PARA>
<PARA>She indicated in that article that more than 96 per cent of cases are resolved without getting to court. I believe that is a very positive change. In other jurisdictions we have legislated to make changes and I refer specifically to the changes to the domestic violence legislation. Until the government said that this behaviour was not only unacceptable but also against the law, I do not believe there was a commitment from employers, unions or workers to look at their behaviour in situ and question how they were conducting their activities at work and in other social organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that cultures are notoriously slow to change. My experience of the coal industry, a traditionally male dominated industry, is replete with examples of the difficulties that men and women face in such a gender segregated work force. As an employee assistance program counsellor, when going to talk to workers on the site I had to contend not only with incredibly explicit photographs on the walls of crib huts and other places but also with the fact that if I raised the issue in a reasonable way somebody would immediately respond with a great deal of aggravation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That did not simply happen with coal miners at the coalface&mdash;I speak literally, although I did not see any pictures at the coalface&mdash;but with senior staff in senior administration meeting rooms. We know that, where there are gender segregated workplaces, individuals who do not fit into the norm will face harassment and difficulties. That not only includes women but also includes men. No harassment or discrimination is acceptable in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area where I believe a great deal still needs to be done is in schools. When a number of my parliamentary colleagues and I spoke to young women on International Women's Day, which was earlier this year, I was interested to hear that the issue of sexual harassment within the school environment among peers and between students and teachers is still an area of contention and an area of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although many people have been critical of the impact of these changes and want to know why women do not stand up and be counted, I can say that when you are faced with harassment of whatever kind you are usually talking about a power differential. At that moment or even later&mdash;maybe even when talking with other women&mdash;there can sometimes be a disinclination to be pro-active about this matter. Despite all the assertiveness training that we do, women are still defined as aggressive if they are assertive, if they challenge the status quo or even if in their communication they address the implied social mores in a particular work situation, and the parliament cannot be isolated in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a great deal more to do as far as educating all workers, employers and unions is concerned. We need to make sure that each employee, employer and union representative is acting responsibly in this area. The continuation of these sorts of amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, which make the legislation more effective, is part of the government's ongoing achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the appendix of the Australian government's report to the international conference in Beijing later this year, there is a very proud list of government achievements for Australian women from 1983 right through until 1995. A cornerstone of these achievements was the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984. I believe the country owes a great debt to Senator Susan Ryan, who was the instigator of this legislation prior to our coming into government. The government's support for these amendments and the various inquiries it has undertaken indicates that this is a government that has led the world in sex discrimination legislation. I commend the Attorney-General on the current amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with some interest to the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). One point she made in her speech which I would like to highlight is the suggestion, which was implicit rather than explicit, that more is to be gained by community education than by legislation in this field. That is a view that I personally have held for some time. However, we are debating a bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced into the House on 30 March this year by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). With this bill, the government proposes to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to implement the second part of the government's response to the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its April 1992 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>. That report was the result of the committee's inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia. The proposed amendments to the act which are contained in this bill were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) nearly 12 months ago on 29 July 1994, on the 10th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act and some two years after the committee presented its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years on, the amendments proposed are: first, the insertion of a preamble to the Sex Discrimination Act incorporating a prohibition on discrimination on the grounds covered by the act and an affirmation that every individual is equal before the law; secondly, the simplification of the test for indirect discrimination, providing a defence to the respondent if the discrimination is reasonable in all the circumstances; thirdly, the inclusion of potential pregnancy as an unlawful ground of discrimination and the removal of the reasonableness test for direct discrimination on the ground of pregnancy; fourthly, the clarification of the `special measures' provision to demonstrate that these measures are not discrimination but are designed to achieve equality of  outcomes; and, fifthly, the removal of the exemption for the Australian defence forces in `combat related duties', while retaining the exemption for `combat duties', to take into account policy changes made by the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the bill but seeks to have aspects of it reviewed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report was, it should be pointed out, far from the unanimous view of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The inquiry took almost two years and received many submissions. At the time of its final meeting, the full committee had a membership of 15, made up of nine government and six coalition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was something of an indictment of the government's self-proclaimed commitment to Australian women that the full committee was only allowed 45 minutes to consider a draft of the whole report. Only four government members attended the final meeting of the committee. Although outnumbered at the meeting by coalition members, those four determined the committee's recommendations. In other words, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report was formally approved by four out of a total membership of 15. Not only was the report dissented from in significant respects by the five coalition members of the committee, but it was not evident that it had the support of the majority of the government members on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal and constitutional affairs committee of this House is not the only body to have examined the issues of gender equity before the law and sex based discrimination. The Australian Law Reform Commission presented the first part of its report on equality before the law called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice for women</EMPHASIS> in 1994. The proposal to amend the preamble to the bill originates with the recommendations of both the committee and the commission that there be a general prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy and a legislative endorsement of the principle of equality before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Act gives effect to Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and goes further. The convention is concerned with discrimination against women whereas the Sex Discrimination Act covers discrimination against either gender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble proposed by this bill is a symbolic statement but it has limited legislative effect. If the apparent meaning of the substantive sections of the act is narrower than the proposed preamble, the preamble will not have the legislative effect of extending or broadening the meaning to be given to those sections. If, however, there is any doubt or ambiguity in the legislative provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act, the proposed preamble may be used to resolve those doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this extent, the preamble will not fully implement the recommendations of the committee and the commission that the prohibition on discrimination have legislative effect. Nor does the proposed preamble incorporate the provisions of international treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended it should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will proscribe discrimination on the grounds of a woman's potential for pregnancy in addition to the existing proscription against discrimination on the grounds of actual pregnancy. In addition, the bill will remove the limitation on the prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, which allowed a defence of reasonableness to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the questions referred to by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), which were raised by the Law Council of Australia in relation to this particular proposal. The questions do, in my view, require a response. It is not enough to say, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said in his second reading speech, simply that the reasonableness defence unnecessarily weakens the protection against discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy. The Attorney's response appears to ignore the significant duty of care an employer owes at common law to all employees and the greater standard of care imposed by that duty that the employer would owe to a pregnant employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to amend the indirect discrimination provisions of the act is the most controversial. Indirect discrimination was first proscribed in the United States and may be said to occur where an ostensibly neutral criterion has a disproportionate and unreasonable impact on either sex. Thus indirect discrimination can be suffered by men and women alike. Indirect discrimination is currently made unlawful by the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to prove the existence of such discrimination, the complainant must establish the four elements of the concept. They are: first, that the alleged discriminator requires the complainant to comply with a requirement or condition; secondly, that the requirement or condition is one with which a substantially higher proportion of persons of the opposite sex to the complainant are able to comply; thirdly, that the requirement or condition be `not reasonable' with regard to the circumstances of the case; and, fourthly, that the requirement or condition be one with which the complainant does not or is not able to comply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The landmark case in indirect discrimination is the High Court decision in Australian Iron and Steel v. Banovic in 1989. That case involved the question of whether the retrenchment policy of AIS operated to effect indirect discrimination. The court found that the company's retrenchment policy did indirectly discriminate because the women employees suffered disproportionately from the combined effect of that policy and a discriminatory hiring policy which caused women to experience significant delays between applying for work and obtaining employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern was raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report that the test of reasonableness used by the courts in indirect discrimination cases is lower than the American requirement of `business necessity' or the English statutory requirement that the condition imposed by the alleged discriminator be proved to be justifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal concern about the complainant being expected to prove that the requirement or condition imposed by the alleged discriminator is not reasonable in the circumstances is that, from an evidentiary viewpoint, this is often insurmountably difficult for the complainant to  establish. In his submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Mr John Basten said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonsense would suggest that the justification for the discriminatory provision should lie on the respondent and not on the complainant. The employer (or other alleged discriminator) who applied the requirement or condition is the person most likely to be able to say why it is reasonable. It may have had consideration to industrial or other issues affecting its workforce as a whole, of which the individual complainant would have no knowledge. It would, in my view, be quite wrong for a complainant to fail where a tribunal is satisfied that the requirement might be reasonable, even though it is unable to come to a conclusion as to whether it is in fact reasonable or not. Presumably, in such a case, the complainant would have failed to satisfy her burden of proof.</PARA>
<PARA>The submissions in this respect, however, were not unanimous. Heather Carmody, the chief executive of the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment, representing the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia, warned that any changes to the reasonableness requirement could be impractical and could possibly disadvantage employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> did not recommend that the indirect discrimination provisions be altered, concluding that at that stage it was unnecessary to amend the provision. However, the Australian Law Reform Commission was in favour of simplifying the indirect discrimination provisions. The commission recommended that a simpler definition of indirect discrimination should be included in the act and that the matters which are to be considered in determining whether or not the condition was reasonable in the circumstances should also be included. The commission also recommended that the act be amended to make it clear that the onus of proof is on the alleged discriminator to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the condition or requirement imposed is reasonable in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now proposes to shift the burden of proof to the alleged discriminator. It would include in the reasonableness test specific matters; namely, the degree of disadvantage resulting from the condition imposed by the alleged  discriminator, whether the disadvantage can be overcome and whether the disadvantage is proportionate to the benefits to the person imposing the condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As his justification for the shifting of the burden, the Attorney-General raised some arguments in his second reading speech. None of the arguments, to my mind, says anything that makes this particular case different from any other piece of litigation in which the burden of proof will normally be placed on the plaintiff, or in this case the complainant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that it would result in a complainant having to go on a fishing expedition is, in my view, misconceived because, in the course of settling the issues to be determined in the course of the proceedings, the respondent would be obliged to identify the reliance on the defence and would be obliged to particularise the grounds upon which the defence is relied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I find the Attorney's arguments somewhat unconvincing. Whether the onus of proof is to be on the complainant or the alleged discriminator, it is important that the defence of `reasonableness' be retained in the legislation in the context of indirect discrimination. In some circumstances the rejection of a person of one sex for preferment or employment, although prima facie discriminatory, may be reasonable for social, health or cultural reasons. For example, evidence was given to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs about the health and safety risks to pregnant women in the lead industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simplification and improvement of the provisions relating to indirect discrimination are to be supported. However, it is important that legitimate concerns about the shifting of the onus of proof held by various interest groups&mdash;including those representing employees, employers and women&mdash;be properly considered before any amendment is made. The differing views aired in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> and the Australian Law Reform Commission reports have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the legislature contemplates shifting the onus of proof from the party seeking to prove its case to the party forced to defend itself, it is wise to leaven enthusiasm with a measure of caution. The issue of indirect discrimination is a serious one and it especially affects women in employment. It is not a matter for an imperfect nor a delayed solution. For this reason, this particular proposal should be examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee with speedy consideration and a speedy report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Act presently provides for what are, in effect, special measures to assist in the achievement of equality of opportunity. The act provides that such measures are not unlawful if they assist persons of a particular sex, marital status or those who are pregnant to achieve equality of opportunity with other persons in circumstances dealt with under the act. The provisions cater for the situation where parity of treatment will not eradicate discrimination and something more must be done to facilitate equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Law Reform Commission recommended that, rather than being classed as an exemption from unlawful discrimination as they currently are, `special measures' should be redefined as a means of achieving equality. Further, to achieve certainty for a special measures program which may involve discrimination, the commission recommended that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner have the power to make a declaration that a measure is a special measure for the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While incorporating the definition of `special measures' into the definition of `discrimination', as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, the bill does not pick up the commission's further recommendation. It does not seek to empower the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to make a declaration that a measure is a special measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not evident why the government has not followed this recommendation, as the Attorney made no reference to it in his second reading speech. I could suggest reasons, but they would be mine and not the government's. Possibly the Attorney could clarify this in his reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final substantive amendment proposed in this bill is to remove the exemption given to the Australian Defence Force which allowed it to restrict women from employment in combat related duties. This is to reflect a change in policy in the force which now allows women to serve in all Defence Force positions, except those involving direct physical combat. In its 1993-94 annual report, the defence department reported that, under the welcome new policy, women may now be employed in all Australian Defence Force positions other than those such as clearance divers in the navy; armour, artillery, infantry and combat engineers in the army; and ground defence units in the air force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures contained in this bill go part of the way to implementing some of the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report and the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice for women</EMPHASIS>. But they do so in an incomplete and, in some cases, ineffective way. Some of the proposals merely reflect what is already happening in the community&mdash;for example, in the Australian Defence Force. If that is a reflection of community attitudes changing as a result of community education programs, it is to be very much welcomed. It also reinforces the point I made at the outset: more is to be achieved by education and changing community attitudes than would be achieved simply by narrow black-letter law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other proposals for change are symbolic with no real legislative effect, such as the preamble to the bill. Some go only halfway, such as the part implementation of the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in respect of special measures. Others need further examination, and the amendment to the important indirect discrimination provisions relating to burden of proof falls into this category. In the circumstances, I commend the second reading amendment moved by the member for Berowra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995 because I, like most of my female colleagues in this place, have taken a keen interest in issues relating to sex discrimination. This amending bill is set to strengthen the existing Sex Discrimination Act, which we all know recently celebrated its 10th birthday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably worth reflecting on that because, when the Sex Discrimination Bill was first brought forward, a lot of people were scared that it was going to change society as we knew it, causing the bottom to fall out of the world and allowing women to take over as feminists ran riot. A few people in this place still think feminists control the whole agenda&mdash;if only we were that lucky. The 10 years that the act has been in existence has shown us quite clearly that it is not something to be scared of. In fact, it has gone a long way to ensuring that women take their place in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), alluded to the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act applies to both sexes and that there have been discrimination cases brought by men. I acknowledge that. But, as this bill arises fundamentally from the government's response to the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal </EMPHASIS>report, I think it is understandable that most of the discussion will concern discrimination against women. I would like to read the first three paragraphs of the summary and recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report, because I think they put the situation into perspective:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Popular history has not adequately recorded the enormous contribution that women have made to Australia. This extends even to quite recent achievements which despite their importance are not widely known. The invisibility of the historical contribution of women weakens the current status of women by diminishing self esteem and the collective sense that women have `earned the right' to choose the lifestyle they want.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the pervasive popular media promotes a stereotype male and female roles which is generally inaccurate and often damaging to women. These stereotypes serve to undermine women's real contribution, reinforces the low status of women's paid and unpaid work and contributes to limitations on what women can do and to the sense of guilt many women feel in not fulfilling the stereotype.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the media portrayal of women is a powerful reinforcing factor, it does reflect deeper social attitudes and standards. No Parliament can overcome deep ingrained social attitudes by merely passing legislation. While legislation is important and can set standards for behaviour, it is the ongoing commitment to a goal which will over time achieve real change.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the heading of chapter 3 in the report is entitled `All women work but only some get paid'. I think that also sets the historical perspective. We know that women's work and women's place in society have changed over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that we are talking about this bill as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Quite a lot has been mentioned about the role of women during the war. Women stayed at home during the war and kept the home fires burning, looking after the children, while their partners went away. The change in women's work to a great extent started then because, in that period, many women worked in the paid work force for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember talking to one of the prominent banks in this country some 30 years ago when it did not at that time employ women as bank tellers. I was told that, during the war, women worked as bank tellers and they were extremely good bank tellers but, of course, when the men came back from the war they had to go back to the typewriter. It astonished me that it had taken all that time for it to be even recognised that women were good at that job and were worthy of doing it. Now, if you go into a bank, I think you will find that most of the tellers are women. Whether that is because they are better with customers over the counter, I do not know, but it is certainly a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the House will not mind if I digress for a moment to mention a particular woman in my electorate. Deputy Speaker Newell frowns, but I am sure he will allow it. I recently had the great privilege to present a civilian medal to a woman in my electorate who had served in the Women's Land Army. I mention her particularly today because she sent a letter to me last week enclosing some photos of that event. After I had dictated the reply, I found out that she had in fact died on the weekend. It was very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to talk to that woman and her friends who had worked together in the Land Army. She went away from home at the age of 17. At that stage, and even in my youth, women generally stayed at home until they got married. So to go away to work in a country area and to live in very primitive conditions was something quite dramatic and, of course, quite exciting for those women. But, like the other women in that situation, she came back and after the war got married, had children and probably never again entered the work force. We made a step forward then a step back, but it certainly sets the tone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only discovered when my father died that women of my mother's generation, for instance, did not know how to write a cheque. That sort of history on women's work and women's place in society is a good grounding for this bill. Women in the paid work force were looked on as temporary. When I started work, I was given the firm impression that it was a stopgap until marriage. That would be a great pity because I still have not married. But I remember my sister complaining at the time she worked for the ABC&mdash;I know that institution and federal government departments insisted on this&mdash;that women had to leave the work force when they got married. Those are the women now, of course, who are complaining that they do not have superannuation because their superannuation was broken at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Younger women today have different expectations and they have different experiences. It is, therefore, much more important for us to have sexual discrimination legislation. Sexual discrimination and sexual harassment are things that I think most women of my age experienced many times over many years, but we did not know what label to put on it. We thought it was something we just had to cop because it was part of the deal of working with a lot of men and that, if we bucked the system&mdash;which none of us I think ever really thought of doing&mdash;we would be in deep trouble; we would not get a promotion or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important to have these sorts of things enshrined in legislation. I take the point of the previous speaker when he said that, no matter what you put in legislation, it is the change in community attitudes which is important. I remember when I lived in the UK and the first racial discrimination act was brought in that was a big point. People were saying, `We don't need legislation. You can't force people to love people of another colour.' Of course, that is true. But the legislation is there as a guide. It is there as, if you like, the big stick hanging over people's head to say, `If you step out of line, you're going to be in trouble.' So I think it is important. The history of this legislation proves that things have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the actual amendment bill, one of the issues covered is pregnancy and the possibility of pregnancy. I will give the House an example of a case of sexual discrimination prior to this amendment. It concerns a woman who was sacked when she became pregnant for the second time. She took her claim to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. She obviously claimed discrimination because of her gender. She had gone back to work after her first child was born, taking up her employer's offer to work part time, which suited her very well. When she informed her employer of her second pregnancy, her employer claimed that she had breached her conditions of employment by accepting the offer of part-time work. So that is a wonderful catch-22 where the boss was trying to be right on both counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is those sorts of traps which have made it difficult in the past for women balancing work and family responsibilities to obtain a fair hearing. These amendments improve the capacity of the human rights commission to enforce the original intentions of the Sex Discrimination Act. In particular, these amendments will specify that potential pregnancy is an unlawful ground for discrimination and they restrict the circumstances in which direct discrimination on the basis of pregnancy can be excused. This will improve the confidence of Australian women in asserting their right to fair treatment in the work force, in the supply of goods and services and in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Act has a purpose in educating, raising awareness and encouraging better practices, not just in providing, as I have said, a mechanism for redress or compensation for those who have been unfairly treated. The number of cases that have come before the commission compared with what was expected is a measure of the fact that the education aspects of the legislation are working. A lot of people now call that `political correctness'. I am glad that term was not around when the bill first came in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government agencies also play a strong part in leading by example. Strategies and practices can be adopted which maximise the inclusiveness and the relevance of the administrative structure not just for women as a particular group but to genuinely adapt to the needs of all. The Department of Social Security has recently released a discussion paper entitled `Women customers: closer links with the Department of Social Security'. I recommend anybody who has not read it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is typical of the Department of Social Security, which in my experience has always been forward looking in trying to do things that will improve the lot of its clients as well as that of its own workers. Part of that is because the department has such a forward looking minister, the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin). If anybody has not read his booklet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beyond the safety net</EMPHASIS>, which will improve the lot of all recipients of social security, including women, I urge them to do so. This sort of initiative demonstrates the impact of adopting principles such as those recommended in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report, and we see these spreading throughout our administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has found that overall about 70 per cent of its customers are women, including 94 per cent of sole parent pensioners, 69 per cent of age pensioners and 97 per cent of family payment recipients. By contrast, only 27 per cent of those receiving jobsearch or newstart are women. Currently, the Department of Social Security consults with its women customers by means of a committee made up of DSS staff. I have attended some of those meetings in my local region and I think they are extremely important. It does this through the staff/community budget suggestion schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussion paper points out that both these mechanisms have shortcomings in their relevance and their accessibility to women customers. It is pleasing to see the department looking seriously at how it can better serve and consult with its major customer group. The impetus to take this initiative arises from the access and equity evaluation, another initiative from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report, which led to the improvements to the Sex Discrimination Act which are before us today. I would like to emphasise that this sort of quiet, incremental, administrative improvement looks at ways of ensuring genuine fairness and an opportunity to have a say, a choice and a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area where more attention needs to be concentrated is in the system for engagement and promotion of academic staff in our post-secondary education institutions. If you have read the newspapers of late, you would have seen that there has been quite of lot of controversy about that. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) certainly shares the view that something needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research by Professor Millicent Poole, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, revealed recently that a glass ceiling exists within academia where women in senior positions were found to often lack career support and to suffer discrimination and sexual harassment. Although the total number of academic staff in Australia's higher education sector more than doubled between 1985 and 1993, tenure is still heavily concentrated among older and more senior male academics. Hidden indirect discrimination is often the major contribution to the glass ceiling which prevents women in academia and elsewhere from reaching their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 20 April on the findings of the research, women found that word of mouth networking in staff recruitment often disadvantaged them and left them open to discrimination. Balancing career and family meant interruptions to career advancement and lack of opportunities to develop their own networks. Despite affirmative action programs, universities have a long way to go before women advance beyond `halfway to equal'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am painfully aware that the Chancellor of Sydney University, Professor Dame Leonie Kramer, does not agree with this. She has always maintained that, if she could do it, any woman could do it. Anyone who knows Dame Leonie&mdash;I have met her on a few occasions&mdash;would know she is the kind of woman who had all the advantages, took them and is not very sympathetic to women who have other problems. I hope the minister will go forward to address that problem, despite Dame Leonie's views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill is both an encouragement and an enforcement mechanism. It is one of which we can all be proud. These amendments strengthen the hand of the human rights commission in ensuring that our aims are put into practice. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) for what I think was a very realistic contribution. We have a lot of common ground on many of the matters she talked about, particularly the need for an educative process and a balance between that educative process and legislation. That was also touched on by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). Education will obviously be very important in this area, as it is in so many others. However, if we do not have the backing of the legislation, it seems to me we will never really make a lot of progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are clearly the government's good intentions in this legislation are not really in dispute in this chamber. We have had a very learned and legal contribution from the gentleman from Tangney, who of course is a very distinguished QC in his own right. I come from somewhat more practical origins, and I will deal with this legislation in probably a less learned way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the principles and the good intentions of the legislation, I think it is important that we look at what the legislation proposes and how it goes about it. Regardless of good intentions, if the legislation does not give effect to those good intentions it will fail. One of the most obvious cases of that in my time in this parliament is the native title legislation. Although it had lots of good intentions, I think everybody accepts these days that it is patently not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the purpose of this bill is to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to incorporate `potential pregnancy' as a new ground for complaints of discrimination; to insert a preamble which sets out the principle of equality; to create a new test for indirect discrimination and to shift the burden of proof to discriminators to establish the reasonableness of their alleged discriminatory behaviour; to remove the `combat related duties' from the exemptions recognised; and to incorporate the definition of `special measures' into the definition of `discrimination' in such a manner that special measures will be excluded from the definition of `discrimination'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may sound like a bit of gobbledegook but, as I understand it, it really means that the bill replaces the special measures provision with a new provision which says that such measures do not amount to discrimination. The special measures provision of the Sex Discrimination Act is now `designed to allow for "situations where exact parity of treatment between different groups cannot eradicate discrimination and that extra steps are required to facilitate equality"'. This provision does not allow for any effective challenge to such provisions by people who believe that they are in fact discriminatory&mdash;that is, existing males may feel particularly aggrieved if they are in effect discriminated against because of the historical context they find themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Act gives effect to Australia's obligations, as most I am sure are aware, under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Its ambit is actually broader than that provided for by the convention&mdash;which is concerned with women&mdash;in that the act covers discrimination against both sexes. The major objectives of the act are: to promote equality between men and women; to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy in certain areas; to eliminate discrimination against employees on the grounds of family responsibilities; and to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace and in certain other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of recent examinations and evaluations of the Sex Discrimination Act, as is appropriate with all legislation. The two major reports on the effectiveness of the act are a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;which is known as the Lavarch committee&mdash;entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal: report of the inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia</EMPHASIS> and a report from the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law: justice for women</EMPHASIS>. Both of these reports concluded that, whilst the SDA has contributed to equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia, `there is still a long way to go'. They both make numerous recommendations for amendments to the legislation, with the Australian Law Reform Commission also recommending that an `Equality act' should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act in July 1994, the government announced six proposals to improve the effectiveness of the act. The amendments proposed were the second part of the government's response to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>. The government made its initial response to the report by introducing amendments to the act in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five of the six amendments announced by the government are, we are told, given effect by this bill. The amendment which has not been proceeded with was a proposal to extend the definition of the proscribed ground discrimination on the grounds of marital status to cover the identity or occupation of the complainant's spouse. The government has said, I understand, that discrimination on the grounds of spousal identity predominantly affects women and is unjustifiable except in very narrow circumstances. But I understand that it is likely that this provision will be considered in the context of the implementation of what is to be stage 3 of the government's response to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five amendments in this legislation which have been proceeded with here do not always conform precisely with the recommendations of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>; nor do they precisely mirror the recommendations made in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill inserts a preamble which is essentially a symbolic statement giving emphasis to the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy and to the principle of equality before the law. This amendment is in response to the recommendations by both the Law Reform Commission and the Lavarch committee that there be a general prohibition of such discrimination and a legislative endorsement of the principle of equality before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both reports recommended that provisions should be added to the Sex Discrimination Act, analogous to the legislative prohibition on race discrimination contained in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. A preamble does not have the same legislative effect as the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. It may clear up ambiguities in provisions. However, a preamble will not extend the meaning to be given to the substantive sections of the act if their apparent meaning is narrower than the words of the preamble itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed preamble does not incorporate the provisions of international treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the Law Reform Commission recommended it should do. The Law Reform Commission also argued that the effectiveness of the general prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy is limited, given the numerous exceptions to this principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill follows the recommendations made in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> that potential pregnancy should be made a prohibited ground of discrimination. The Lavarch committee made this recommendation despite recognising that potential pregnancy may already fall within the prohibited forms of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also removes the limitation on the prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, which required that the discrimination be `unreasonable'. The prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy or potential pregnancy will now be the same as the prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the most controversial provision of this bill is the section dealing with indirect discrimination. Indirect discrimination, as I understand it, can be said to occur where an ostensibly neutral criterion or condition has a disproportionate and unreasonable impact on either sex. When announcing the proposed simplification of this act's provisions regarding indirect discrimination, the government said the current complexity of the act's tests for indirect discrimination had meant that there were only 11 such complaints during the act's 10 years of operation. The government also said that indirect discrimination is one of the more insidious forms of discrimination, and nobody really disputes that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law</EMPHASIS> both say that indirect discrimination plays a leading role in perpetuating inequality and that, because such discrimination is hidden, it is usually more difficult to recognise and to rectify. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> did not actually recommend that the indirect discrimination provision be simplified. The committee concluded that it was unnecessary `at this stage'&mdash;which was in 1992&mdash;to amend the provision. The Law Reform Commission was in favour of simplifying the provisions, and in a discussion paper regarding proposed amendments the Attorney-General's Department pointed out that simplifying the legislation would bring it into line with equivalent ACT and Queensland provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department also commented that leaving the indirect discrimination provision unamended was disadvantageous in that it does not appear to be an effective means of combating indirect discrimination as the provision is little used and the jurisdiction on it is not well developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to shift the burden of proof of establishing whether the criterion, which has the indirectly discriminatory effect, is `reasonable'. At the moment the complainant must establish the unreasonableness of the criteria. The bill's amendment will now require the defendant to prove the criteria are reasonable. This amendment reflects the recommendations in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, which were that the defence of reasonableness should be available to someone found to have engaged in indirect discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Reform Commission made a similar recommendation. Both bodies have argued that the information as to whether criteria used are reasonable is likely to be more available to the person using the criteria&mdash;the alleged discriminator&mdash;than to the person who is the subject of the criteria. It is quite common for facts that are peculiarly within the knowledge of one party to be proven by that party. Employer groups have objected to the shift in the burden of proof, claiming that such a shift would encourage dubious claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few words now about that interestingly entitled section `Special measures'. The special measures provision of the SDA is designed to allow for situations where exact parity of treatment between men and women cannot eradicate discrimination and where extra steps are required to facilitate equality. At the moment, special measures are given an exemption from the anti-discrimination provisions of the act. Both <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law</EMPHASIS> recommended that, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the protection of special measures, the definition of special measures needed to be incorporated into the definition of `discrimination'. The bill does this. However, it does not follow the Law Reform Commission's further recommendation that, to ensure certainty for programs which may involve discrimination, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner should be given the power to declare a program or policy a special measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I mention combat duties. The exemption given to the Australian Defence Force which allowed it to restrict women from employment in combat related duties is no longer necessary as women can now serve in all Defence Force positions except those involving direct physical combat. I find it encouraging that in the defence forces, which in some senses would probably be regarded as the last bastion of male chauvinism, there is quite obviously change going on. Recently I had occasion to attend the unveiling of a war memorial in my electorate. The army came along with a band, an honour guard and a small cavalry platoon. Of the five members of the cavalry, two of them were women. Of the band, 50 per cent were women and, of the armed escort party, three out of five were women. That is something which when I served in the forces&mdash;I was there for 20-odd years; I left 18 years ago&mdash;would have been unheard of. It is a very tangible measure of how things have changed, and quite rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's explanatory memorandum tells us what is in the bill. It talks about the preamble. It talks about simplifying the test for indirect discrimination. It talks about repealing and replacing section 7 of the act to include potential pregnancy. It talks about the special provisions and the armed forces provisions that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important also, apart from just examining what is in the bill, to make some comments. I and the coalition have some concerns with aspects of this legislation. The most contentious amendment relates to essentially moving the burden of proof in respect of the reasonableness test from the complainant, who currently must establish the unreasonableness of the criteria, to the respondent, who would have to show that the criteria is reasonable in the circumstances. This is said to be on the basis that the information as to whether criteria used are reasonable is likely to be more available to the person using the criteria than to the person who is a subject of the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reversing the onus of proof in any matter is a very serious policy decision about which we should all express some concern and look at very carefully. It is important to say that the coalition members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in the 1992 report&mdash;the Lavarch report&mdash;entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, opposed a shift in the onus of proof in their dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge there may be a way to satisfy all parties. Perhaps one of the ways to do that is for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to be given the task of investigating that, bearing in mind the very substantial concerns that were raised by a number of people in the community by shifting the burden of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some groups&mdash;for example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry&mdash;have said to us that this legislation will be significantly disadvantageous in the workplace. Others&mdash;such as the Women's Electoral Lobby, anti-discrimination groups and so on&mdash;were very much in favour of the amendment. The ACCI has indicated it had been negotiating with the government to try to effect some sort of change but had not been able to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special measures provision does not contain any test such as time limits, reviewability and so on. A special measure is to be treated as being taken for the purpose of achieving equality if it is taken solely for that purpose, or for that purpose as well as other purposes, whether or not that purpose is the dominant or substantial one. Again, consultation elicited both support for and opposition to that amendment. There are a lot of doubts in the community which need to be looked at, and perhaps the Senate committee could look at some of those factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has moved a second reading amendment to highlight its concerns in relation to the burden of proof. I and my colleagues on this side of the House support the objectives of this legislation. We support efforts to simplify indirect discrimination in principle. We do express, however, serious concerns about the reversal of the onus of proof. We express concern as to the appropriateness of these changes vis-a-vis those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the bill should be referred to the Senate committee in an attempt to resolve those concerns. Given the government's indifferent history in some of these tricky areas with other legislation of recent times, I would suggest it would be well advised to listen to some of the coalition's constructive comments in this respect. I commend the amendment to the House, but certainly indicate support for the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill. These amendments are a further step towards achieving equality for both men and women in today's society&mdash;a vision the Labor government had when it initiated the legislation over 10 years ago and began the long road towards social change. The act's underlying purpose to this day remains very simple: to end discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy, and to promote community respect for the principle of equality for both men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the life of this significant piece of legislation we have seen an important shift in the majority of Australians' attitudes towards the issue of sexual discrimination. That shift has brought us closer to achieving the underlying purpose of the act. When this Labor government had the foresight to introduce this legislation in 1984, it did so against an opposition that was vocal, hostile and ignorant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government had the gumption to address this issue, it did so against a society where the majority accepted such discrimination as a part of life. Ignorance forced many to falsely assume that this legislation was the brainchild of radical feminists. This led many women to ignore the personal effect sexual discrimination was having on their lives and led many men to ignore the effect sexual discrimination was having on the lives of their wives, mothers, sisters and daughters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ignorance forced many to question not what we should do about the problem but whether there was a problem to begin with. Labor had the vision to take a stand and address the issue of discrimination. The changes that have occurred over the last decade have had an enormous impact on the lives of women and have installed in the majority of us the concept of equal opportunity for every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of inequality between the sexes is no longer questioned. The question now is how we can continue to address it. Like so many other watershed reforms in Australian society, both in the past and present, only a Labor government has the foresight, political will and courage to tackle the major issue. Whether it be the groundbreaking equal opportunity legislation of the Whitlam era, the Australia Act of the Hawke era or the native title legislation of the Keating period, only Labor governments have the capacity to deliver for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five amendments that we are debating today follow up the government's initial response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal </EMPHASIS>report and the subsequent amendments that were made to the act in 1992. I am pleased to say that these further amendments tighten the legislation and ensure clear provisions are in place for the individual's right to equal opportunity. Firstly, a strong legislative statement incorporating a general prohibition on discrimination and proclaiming equality before the law of men and women has been included. This preamble clearly emphasises the government's commitment that sex discrimination and sexual harassment will not be tolerated in today's society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, potential pregnancy has been explicitly included as a new ground for complaints of discrimination. The prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy or potential pregnancy will now be the same as the prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status. Clearly, this new inclusion will afford better protection for women and safeguard against the unwarranted discrimination that has shamefully occurred in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the definition of indirect discrimination has been simplified, placing the onus on the respondent to justify the implementation of discriminatory provisions. To date, the complexity of the act's test for indirect discrimination has resulted in only 11 such cases. This is an important amendment because, in the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tackling indirect discrimination is a key element in the elimination of discrimination because the barriers to equality are often the result of apparently neutral practices.</PARA>
<PARA>Thankfully, blatant forms of discrimination, such as `You can't have this job because you are a woman' are now rare. However, practices still exist that indirectly discriminate against women&mdash;for example, the provision of male toilets only or one size fits all uniforms. It is hoped that the simplified definition will encourage more people to utilise this provision if they feel discriminated against in any form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the special measures provision has been included in the definition of `discrimination'. This provision recognises that a measure designed to achieve equality does not constitute discrimination. It is hoped that this inclusion will express more clearly to the community that extra steps are often required to facilitate equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the final amendment was a simple but necessary measure to reflect a change that has already occurred in the Australian Defence Force. Women can now work in all Defence Force positions, except those involving direct physical combat. This has opened up many career and employment opportunities for women. In 1984, only 10 per cent of Defence Force positions were available to women. Today, women can be employed in over 65 per cent of the positions in the army and in over 90 per cent of those in the navy and the air force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, these amendments contribute to the increased effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act. However, the Labor government understands that it cannot stand alone as the only weapon against discrimination in our society. We have consistently put in place programs to combat discrimination and draw attention to the capabilities of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far back as 1985, then Prime Minister Hawke announced a national agenda for women and the government's acceptance of affirmative action legislation and supportive measures. Affirmative action programs have been extremely effective in identifying discriminatory policies and practices. The programs have forced companies and higher education institutions to address the lack of opportunity for women and set objectives to advance women into the future. By 1989, all higher education institutions and 97 per cent of private sector organisations had implemented affirmative action programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While legislation is important and can set standards for behaviour, it is the ongoing commitment to a goal that will over time achieve real change that is of the most importance. The Labor government's commitment to eliminating sex discrimination is evident through the number of strategies in place to work towards equal opportunity for women. The government has consistently supported strategies such as the provision of affordable, quality child care, the payment of family assistance directly to women caring for children, greater access to superannuation and better access to training and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of affordable, quality child care has been a top priority for the Labor government, and there has been significant progress in this area. In 1984, only 58,900 child-care places were available, and the government spent $80.1 million on child-care issues. To accommodate the overwhelming number of women re-entering the work force, there are now over 2.4 million child-care places available, and the government spends $894 million on child-care issues each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not only offered tangible solutions to the child-care explosion but also endeavoured to address the issue of child care as a work related expense as opposed to a welfare payment for women. We believe women should be given the same opportunities to enter the work force as their male counterparts. Women should be able to go to work without guilt, safe in the knowledge that their children will be well looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women should be commended for their efforts in juggling a career and a family. Make no mistake: the juggling act that women perform is an amazing feat. A survey in 1987 noted that, despite the time spent in paid employment, unpaid work still falls disproportionately to women, regardless of wage rates, education or the income of their husband. Women still by far perform the majority of the housework, look after the children, are the biggest volunteers in our society and contribute economically through paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are proud of the policies that this government has put in place to support women in their fight for equal opportunity, but the women in our society themselves must take all the credit for the progress they have made. It is satisfying to see just how far women have come. Dr Dale Spender, a feminist writer and teacher, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the beginning of the century, women belonged to men. By the end of the 20th century, women will belong to themselves. It is a revolution well worth celebrating.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor government is excited to be part of that revolution. However, the road to social change is a long one and we still have a long way to go. Women are still not fully represented in the political arena or in the top echelons of business. If the progress we have made is going to mean anything, the inequalities between men and women in these areas must continue to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have always been significantly unrepresented in Australian political life. Since 1901, 430 people have been elected to the Senate; only 34 of them have been women. In the House of Representatives, 849 people have been elected; only 16 of them have been women. As a result, women represent only 11.4 per cent of all parliamentarians in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government would like to see that changed. At the Labor National Conference last year, we set a solid objective that will provide the means for women to enter the political arena. By the year 2002 women must be preselected within the Labor Party for 35 per cent of all winnable seats. We believe this sets an example to the rest of the community and offers women something tangible, not just empty promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, we were criticised by the opposition for this commitment and not surprisingly this criticism was  delivered without a formulated policy of its own. The opposition devotes so much of its time attempting to undermine the achievements women have made and the policies that aim to close the gap between the sexes that it would barely have time to develop a worthwhile policy of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition vehemently protested the need for this piece of legislation over 10 years ago and still it has its head in the clouds, refusing to acknowledge that the problem of inequality between men and women exists and is real. A prime example of this was the opposition's intention to abolish the Affirmative Action Agency and incorporate its equal opportunity functions into the Department of Industrial Relations. In 1992, then opposition leader John Hewson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treating women as women&mdash;almost by definition&mdash;implies that women are different. Treating women as people means that women and men&mdash;by definition&mdash;start on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the coalition has no understanding of the entrenched discrimination and neglect which is the reality of many women's lives. Clearly, the coalition has no understanding of the social change that must continue to occur in the future. If women's issues were left to the wait and see what happens coalition, we would all be walking around with our heads still buried in those clouds, turning a blind eye to sex discrimination and equal employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without ignoring the progress made by successive Labor governments, we must acknowledge that progress still is slow. We must continue to bridge the gap between men and women, especially in the business sector. Women are yet to assert themselves in top management positions and must continue their fight for career advancement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1994 study conducted into women's career advancement found that three-quarters of the women surveyed had either stayed at the same skill level or moved backwards in their working lives. In 1993, over 74 per cent of managerial positions were occupied by men, which means that women represent only 26 per cent of Australia's 618,000 senior managers. This figure is not representative of the diverse skills women have brought to the work force, and it must change in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government is sending the message to the rest of the community that the time has come for change. The time has come for women to stand up and be counted. The time has come to put an end to sexual discrimination. We understand that legislation alone cannot produce the changes required, but it does play an important part in changing community attitudes and expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community attitudes are changing. Another poll conducted in 1994 indicated that younger women are less likely to put up with sexual harassment in the workplace. Since this act's inception, more than 7,000 complaints have been lodged&mdash;the overwhelming majority of these employment related&mdash;and the number of complaints of discrimination each year is increasing. These are real achievements as they indicate the growing understanding in the community that discrimination is illegal and that there are avenues for fighting it in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fight must continue. The amendments outlined today will ensure that the Sex Discrimination Act remains as one of the most significant pieces of legislation in our history. These amendments are the result of the government's second response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report. I have no doubt that in the future there will be further amendments to ensure that this act continues to be relevant in our changing world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality I have presented today is that women have come a long way in asserting themselves in our society, but there is still a long way to go before they are fully recognised for their efforts. We all have a role to play in challenging the stereotypes that imprison not just women but many groups in our society. We must continue down the road the Labor government began back in 1984 and give every individual the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. May the revolution continue and may Australia benefit as a nation from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of recent examinations and evaluations of the Sex Discrimination Act.

Both these reports concluded that, while the Sex Discrimination Act has contributed to equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia, there is still a long way to go. Both reports make numerous recommendations for amendments to the legislation and the Australian Law Reform Commission also recommends that an equality act be introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major objectives of the act are to promote equality between men and women; to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy in certain areas; to eliminate discrimination against employees on the ground of family responsibilities; and to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace and in certain other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the legislation we have had in place for somewhere around 10 years has been a great catalyst in shifting community attitudes and in making many of the changes that needed to be made in contemporary Australia. One of the most important of those is ensuring that equality of opportunity is available to all Australians. There is no doubt that we have also witnessed over the decade a number of major changes in the role of women and the status of women within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to listen to the speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on this Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill. He mentioned the increase in the number of women in the work force as perhaps having been as a result of the Sex Discrimination Act and a number of other areas where women have indeed made gains, such as in accessing education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think part of the reason for women playing a greater role in the work force today is economic necessity. In fact, reports have indicated that a majority of women with dependent children would prefer, if the economic situation allowed, to be home looking after and caring for their families. I doubt that anyone can really determine what impact this particular legislation has had on getting women more involved in the work force compared with the economic conditions that have prevailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been minor increases in the number of women coming into politics. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) specifically raised this issue. The honourable member said that the Liberal Party of Australia had no plan to deliver more women into politics. That is untrue. The Liberal Party has not proposed the arbitrary system of quotas which the Australian Labor Party has seen fit to introduce, but it has a determined plan to assist women who want to put themselves forward for preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked many times about why women do not get preselected. I can speak on behalf of the Liberal Party. I cannot speak on behalf of the Labor Party. However, it would seem to me that the reason why more women are not selected for positions within the parliament is that they are not putting themselves forward. Invariably, one woman&mdash;as compared with a number of men&mdash;runs for preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem is not one of setting arbitrary quotas; it is one of encouraging women to put themselves forward, and then resourcing them to go through the preselection process. That preselection process is a rigorous one. Many women recoil from it. They think the parliament is a male dominated arena. That is understandable. I thought that myself&mdash;and it is true. Only 10.3 per cent of the people in this chamber are women, and the percentage is a bit higher in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perception by some women that they cannot break through those barriers and that they cannot have meaningful dialogue and debate in this place is quite wrong. We must encourage women to put themselves forward for preselection. It is then, and only then, that we will see more women enter this place and the other parliaments within this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has a very definite plan to deliver that. The other day, Lenore Taylor wrote an article which appeared on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It was about the Labor Party's failure to deliver women at preselection, despite its well-publicised quota system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are more than matching the Labor Party at the moment. I turn now to other aspects of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill. Apart from some minor improvements in the rate of women's entry into politics and into the decision making areas of our country, we have seen some improvements in their position within the judiciary. However, some people say that in the paid work force&mdash;and certainly within the higher echelons, on the boards of private and public corporations&mdash;the position of women seems to be static and that, in some cases, it has even worsened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no doubt that, despite the fact that we have had 10 years under equal opportunity legislation and the Sex Discrimination Act, women in Australia today are still undervalued and underrated. Their status is nothing like it ought to be. The unpaid work of women, for example, is rarely ever talked about in this place or in the wider community, yet it amounts to $163 billion worth. It is a little over 60 per cent of the nation's official productivity figure. Yet where can one read about it? Where can one hear about that contribution? Very little is ever published and very little is ever said in this place about that immense contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have the main responsibility for domestic work&mdash;and it is unpaid work. It is interesting to note that, on average, men spend about 4 1/2 hours a day at their paid occupation and about two hours a day contributing to the unpaid domestic scene. The situation with women is the reverse of that. Women spend about four hours a day on domestic work and two hours a day in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of child care, roughly a third of all Australian women have dependent children and 91 per cent of sole parent families are headed by women. Another interesting fact refers to grandmothers&mdash;I am one and I am happy to talk about them&mdash;and that is that 43 per cent of young children are cared for by grandmothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, women carry the biggest burden of the caring role in the community: 72.6 per cent of care provided for the elderly is provided by women, as is 75 per cent of care for the mentally ill and 60 per cent of care for disabled members of the community. Women carry a very large proportion of the caring work within our community. Very often that work is unpaid and unaccountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, despite equal pay legislation, women still earn less than men, and as they are less likely than men to be in the paid work force to begin with they are more dependent. Recent studies have indicated that the average weekly income for a full-time employed woman is $546.70, whilst for men the average weekly income is $648.70. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1994, 41.1 per cent of women held part-time jobs in Australia, as against 10 per cent of men. Thirty-one per cent of the casual jobs were occupied by women, as against 16 per cent of men. This means that women are poorer in terms of their cash wealth and they have less access to credit. Retirement benefits are not an option for many women in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards women in decision making roles, I have already touched on that issue in so far as it affects the parliament. We still only have three per cent of women on our government boards. In the rural sector, the picture is even more abysmal. Rural women are very often partners in business, yet they have very little say because they are not included on the statutory bodies which make the decisions affecting rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which we are amending today, and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986. We have the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Despite 10 years of this kind of legislation, we still have a situation that is unsatisfactory and a community that has failed to deliver equality of opportunity to women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the report of the Law Reform Commission, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law: justice for women</EMPHASIS>. The conclusion to the chapter on `Gender inequality' is very relevant:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a very basic quantitative level, measured only through statistical data, women have not achieved equality with men in all major aspects of their lives. It has been assumed by some that once women gradually made their way into male-dominated professions such as law, it would only be a matter of time before they made their way to the top of these professions. The statistics indicate that there are no grounds for such optimism. The inequality as outlined in this chapter&mdash;in women's social position and as targets of violence, in women's lesser access to financial resources, to employment and equal pay and to positions of influence in political and legal institutions&mdash;all adversely affect the ability of women to use and receive justice from the legal system. If women's access to the law is to be improved and the law is to apply equally and to deliver equality, these broader issues must also be addressed. At present the law does little to redress the effects of inequality. In fact it can actually reinforce and amplify these effects. The facts reported in this chapter establish the need for the law to play a more positive role in redressing discrimination and promoting equality.</PARA>
<PARA>With that in mind, the coalition does support the amendments that are being made to this bill to try to improve the position of women in Australia today. The role of the Sex Discrimination Act is an important one. It is recognised as an important measure addressing discrimination against women and it has been particularly useful in redressing complaints of discrimination in employment and of sexual harassment. If any people believe that is not a problem today, they are not hearing the same stories that I am. There are still difficulties in that area, and this amendment will go some way toward redressing those situations. The amendments to this bill are therefore necessary, although there were other areas which have been recommended which have not been included, and they might be the subject of another debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of this bill is to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in the following ways. One is to incorporate potential pregnancy as a new ground for complaint of discrimination so that you cannot be refused equal opportunity on the basis that you are of an age where you may become pregnant&mdash;and it has been evident in many of the commercial areas in Australia today that discrimination has been based on that principle. The second purpose is to insert a preamble which sets out the principle of equality. Equality is a basic human right for all Australians, male or female. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third is to create a new test for indirect discrimination and to shift the burden of proof to the discriminator to establish the reasonableness of their allegedly discriminatory criteria. I would like to pause on that for half a moment. The reasonableness amendment has caused some concern within the business community, and there is a good reason for its concern. The amendment means that the onus of proof shifts from the person who is being or feels they are being discriminated against to prove the case to the person who is being accused of discriminating. That gives rise to some concerns, as I said, within the business community; and wearing my other hat as shadow minister for small business I must, of course, take note of those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have been giving close scrutiny to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, and it is those unfair dismissal provisions which give rise to some concern about the shift of onus of proof in this particular area. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has displayed an attitude of being quite unwilling to change, yet the unfair dismissal proposals within that act have caused a great deal of concern and have actually stopped employers from employing because they are so weighted against the employer. I think we would do ourselves a great injustice if we did not give very close scrutiny to this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the unfair dismissal proposals, the coalition supports decency in dismissing people, as we would support proper redress for people who have been discriminated against in the way suggested here. But the point is that the unfair dismissal laws were not very specific. They just talked about unfair dismissal without any definition. We saw some terrible cases go before the commission, and I think some very poor judgments in that respect, because no-one basically had any guidelines on how to deal with that particular issue. We saw a situation in the unfair dismissal area where in one case an employee was caught putting their hand in the till and stealing from an employer and they were dismissed. Then the commission ordered that that person be reinstated and that the dismissal be carried out in a certain way. I believe that was quite unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should watch this very closely, we should have rules that everybody fully understands and we should have some kind of guideline for dealing with the provisions of discrimination, particularly where the onus of proof is to be shifted onto the person who is allegedly discriminating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the general thrust of this bill. We welcome the fact that it might have teeth. One thing we might consider also is that these bills, as I said earlier, are not going to within themselves shift and change community attitudes. That has to come about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to be supporting this very important legislation, the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill, and I commend opposition members for the fact that they are not opposing it. It is good that in this chamber we can get agreement on these very important issues of discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of members from both sides will comment on the general issues, but I want to concentrate on an area in which I have a particular responsibility within the government, and that is as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister on issues of access and equity. I want to raise some questions in this debate about discrimination against women of non-English speaking background and women of Aboriginal background. In that context, these are significant issues. Although the whole general issue of discrimination against women is extremely important, if we look at the subcategories of that discrimination, we see that ethnic women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are in a doubly disadvantaged situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter that should be of some concern because often these people suffer from double discrimination&mdash;that is, discrimination based on their gender and discrimination based on their ethnic, cultural or racial background. It is very important to note that a number of reports have identified this problem and have called for action to deal with it. If we are going to overcome discrimination, we need to tackle the problems at the core. In particular, I commend members to read the state of the nation report of the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner in 1993, a report on people of non-English speaking background, which emphasised the problems which women of NESB face in a range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of this discrimination is intentional and direct. In addition, there is unintentional and indirect discrimination which, nevertheless, is still discrimination and still a failure to treat people equally. That issue needs to be tackled within the context of our access and equity policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at a range of key areas of achievement, one sees that women of non-English speaking background either have general discrimination against them or are in a disadvantaged position. This is brought out in the 1993 report by Irene Moss which I referred to. For example, in the area of employment, in terms of both participation rates in the work force and unemployment, women of non-English speaking background are in a serious situation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour market participation for NESB women is lower in most age groups than for English Speaking Background (ESB) or Australian-born women. This is particularly the case for women aged between 15-24 years . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1977, the employment participation rate for overseas-born females was 47.8%, with the greatest participation rate being for those aged between 20 and 44 years. By 1981, this had fallen to 45.8% with the main decline being for those women aged 55 years or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 1987 the participation rate of women of non-English speaking background increased to 47.2%, about 3% cent less than that for Australian-born females. By 1990, the overall rate of female participation in employment rose to 52.9%. The participation of NESB women in 1990 was only marginally lower than that of ESB and Australian-born women&mdash;48.2% compared to 54.2%. However, while this difference may seem marginal it needs to be viewed in the terms of the compounded disadvantages that these women face in employment. Not only are there significant wage differentials between men and women in Australia, but women of non-English speaking background are disadvantaged even more than women in the general population by a further 6% employment differential.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the situation in 1990. In fact, in the last two years in particular, the government has put into place specific programs&mdash;to answer the interjection of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman)&mdash;to try to deal with this issue, and there has been increased participation in the work force by NESB women. But&mdash;and I am not running away from this fact&mdash;the reality is that we still have more to do. </PARA>

He will see facts in terms of outcomes for people of non-English speaking background. But what I want to emphasise to the chamber in the context of this debate is&mdash;not gloating about achievements&mdash;the fact that there is still more to be done for people, and, in the context of this bill, specifically women, of non-English speaking background in relation to discrimination issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously situations in which, if women of non-English speaking background are given the opportunities, they will show that they are up to it and, in fact, can surpass any requirements. This has been shown in the area of education where, when opportunities have been created, women of non-English speaking background have shown that they are as capable as&mdash;and, indeed, in certain circumstances have surpassed and exceeded the achievements of&mdash;men. This has been the case where opportunities have been created in the Aboriginal community, as well. So it is a question of creating the opportunities and overcoming the barriers. That is what access and equity are all about. It is also what the main structure of these amendments to the act is putting into place, especially where discrimination is based on gender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this overall challenge that we face, I commend again <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The challenge of diversity: Policy options for a multicultural Australia</EMPHASIS>, edited by James Jupp, which is produced through the auspices of the Office of Multicultural Affairs. In the section on NESB women, we see a lack of access to important positions in the bureaucracy, in government, in the Public Service, in key business organisations and in other influential positions in the professions for women of non-English speaking background. This is repeated, as I say, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The challenge of diversity</EMPHASIS>. But the conclusions are not pessimistic. They show that, if we can put into place laws which work in a fair way to overcome discrimination, these people will be given a full opportunity and, having been given that opportunity, they will achieve the outcomes. There is no doubt about that, and that is what this report recommends. If we do give those opportunities to women of non-English speaking background, they will show that they are capable of those achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might read from the conclusion of that report, because what is said here reflects the sentiments of the government and certainly mine in my responsibilities in this area. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective participation of women from non-English speaking backgrounds in Australian society is the fundamental cornerstone of the creation of an equitable society. It can only be achieved if certain circumstances exist and conditions are met. That these circumstances should exist and these conditions are met are predicated on a philosophy of social justice, access and equity for all Australians and economic realism. Women from NESBs contribute socially and economically to Australian society; it is in the interests of this society that these contributions be recognised, valued and utilised. The value of women from NESBs as human resources will only begin to be fully appreciated when they become more visible and active in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The numerous barriers to effective participation of women from NESBs include the following: women from NESBs are not present in decision making structures and therefore they are often marginalised and not empowered to make decisions for themselves. Consultative procedures are inappropriate linguistically and culturally (which language is used, simplicity of language, how information is gathered, gender and ethnicity of who collects the information, where and when information is collected). Services are usually monocultural/ monolingual in orientation and the service providers are often insensitive and sometimes hostile to cultural and linguistic differences and preferences. Information on services, programs and policies is usually inaccessible (language used, who and how delivered, where provided). Resources from special programs for women from NESBs are usually difficult to obtain, inadequate and of short-term duration. Women from NESBs are isolated and alienated in the home and in the workplace; they are encouraged to see their issues and concerns as personal and individual and not as collective or shared perspectives.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the tragic things is that in some instances women of non-English speaking background, because of the cultural milieu from which they come, are often left at home in suburban houses isolated from the rest of the community, unable to contact other people except through the telephone, and not knowing sufficient English to be able to even get around and get into programs so that they can assist themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way to deal with this&mdash;and I have emphasised this on a number of occasions in my speeches on access and equity&mdash;is to target the specific communities and have workers who are responsible for assisting those communities to overcome what is obviously not an intentional but nevertheless real discrimination in terms of accessibility of services for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of linguistic resources in an appropriate way to the groups that matter is one of the issues that we are still tackling. I have to say that in the last 12 months a number of key government departments have moved in this area. I want to commend especially the people in the Department of Employment, Education and Training for the way in which they now, through the Working Nation proposals, are trying to ensure that all people of NESB&mdash;and this includes women who have those specific problems&mdash;are case managed in such a way that they can overcome whatever discriminations there are for them. We are still in the process of seeing the outcome of this but we have put into place the mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was something which was long overdue in this country, a mechanism which actually says, `If you're unemployed and a woman of non-English speaking background or both, you obviously have specific disadvantages. Let's try and deal with your case through a situation of case management which takes into account all the factors responsible for your unemployment and then we can see what you need. Do you need an English language course? Let's get you into an English language course. Do you need training in a particular area? Let's give you that specific training and after we have done that let's see what form of genuine and real employment we can get you into.' Those kinds of case management approaches ought to be heralded as a big breakthrough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Working Nation is very important for discriminated groups and for this particular group, women of non-English speaking background. I will continue with the list of factors identified in the report here. Women from non-English speaking backgrounds lack special support structures. For example, they lack ESL classes geared to their requirements and child care to facilitate involvement in training and retraining programs. These barriers were regularly identified as impeding the participation of women from NESB in Australian society, and the breakdown of these barriers is an essential and overriding goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this, the issue of the future role of women of non-English speaking background in our society is going to be an important matter in terms of the double discrimination that occurs against them. We have to do more in this area, but let me just say that in the last few years we have already put into place a number of important programs. What I would like to see now is further action in these programs, further specific initiatives by a number of departments of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my role in the promotion of access and equity policy I have had discussions with a number of ministers about this very issue, the promotion of a number of initiatives that target the discriminated groups, irrespective of whether the discrimination is caused by conscious action or caused indirectly and unintentionally, to try to overcome that discrimination, to try to overcome that disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will use an example which is identified in the reports. I am referring to the cultural and linguistic barriers that prevent a number of women of non-English speaking background from having pap smear tests. Unfortunately, the proportion of women having pap smear tests who come from non-English speaking backgrounds is much lower than the proportion of the population as a whole. Part of the problem is the cultural factors which lead these women into a situation where they fear the pap tests. They fear the medical procedure involved. They fear the outcome. They fear the possible response of their spouses in relation to what might happen if the pap test is positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a whole range of cultural factors which prevent these women from doing the sensible thing&mdash;in this case, having the test. This is a case where it is not intentional discrimination, but it does result in a problem for the community. We must attack this problem with a range of culturally sensitive measures which use the linguistic resources available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I am very happy to be associated with the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) for putting forward this bill to help overcome the discrimination which continues against women. I am particularly interested in assisting the government in whatever way I can to remove discrimination against women of non-English speaking backgrounds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of the proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act that the House is considering today, through the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill, arise from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, reports on equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia, as well as on sex discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a long inquiry. It took 2 1/2 years to complete. I was the most active opposition member of that committee. I was strongly supported by the then member for McEwen, Mrs Fran Bailey, who was also a very active supporter of matters of significance to women. I pay tribute to her for her support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was one of the least satisfying inquiries of the parliament in terms of the way in which it was conducted by the then chairman, the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I will not go into detail as to why I make that criticism, but the Attorney-General is aware of the differences that we had during that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report to the House that the current chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), is a man who lives by the traditions of the parliament. The honourable member understands that all parties, all individuals and all members need to participate if the committee is to produce a report of which the parliament can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the inquiry taking 2 1/2 years and receiving something like 643 submissions&mdash;some of them lengthy and well-argued legal submissions&mdash;the subcommittee, of which I was the deputy chairman, considered the final report in an hour and a half. The full committee considered the final draft in three-quarters of an hour. There has never been a parliamentary committee, in my experience, that has been so flippant in its consideration of such an important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only four members of the government deigned to attend the committee meeting to consider the final report. All six opposition members of the committee were there. They knew that, if they called for a division on the issue, the government would have won the day. So there was no point in calling a division when it was obvious that the government members would have called in their friends, ultimately, and the government would have adopted their report on the weight of numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the view of the coalition members of that committee that the government was not serious in discrimination matters. It had a set ideological agenda. Mr Lavarch was interested in his career, and that was the direction that was taken. Australians need to look very carefully now at the legislation that has resulted from what I believe is a flawed report but a report which contains valuable information and makes valuable recommendations. With more time and a bit of care I think this legislation would be much better and reflect an improved report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill has been a long time coming in the parliament. Mr Lavarch has been Attorney-General for some time and, despite his enthusiasm when he was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, he has had difficulty in getting around a lot of the recommendations he so fervently espoused and promoted as chairman of that committee. The result is that amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act are found today in a preamble, which is a sort of general grab or statement of intention of the legislation. That is a rather good thing to do but it has no strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some feeling amongst the committee members that it would strengthen the legislation. I do not believe it does. Where the legislation is drafted more narrowly than the scope of the preamble, the preamble cannot cover what is not in the legislation itself. But, if there are matters that lack clarity within the legislation and the preamble enlightens them, the preamble can and should be considered. It is a nice thing to do but it is not as substantial as actually getting down to looking at the legislation itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure in this legislation will amend sections 5 (2), 6 (2) and (2) of the act to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . simplify the test for indirect discrimination, clarify the meaning of indirect discrimination and provide a defence to the respondent if the respondent can satisfy all the elements of the defence including, that the condition, requirement or practice, the imposition of which it is alleged amounts to indirect discrimination, is reasonable in the circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the reverse onus of proof process, where it is not the person who is bringing the case that has to prove that unreasonable acts have happened; the person who is the employer in most circumstances has to demonstrate that he or she has been reasonable. The coalition members of the committee felt that this was an inappropriate way of making law, and there are a number of reasons for their view that reverse onus of proof should not be tolerated by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing a process of human rights as parties we look on education and the prospects of conciliation as the best way to advance. Ninety-five per cent of complaints are settled by conciliation, and we feel that, in view of the litigious way in which Australians are pursuing matters before the courts, the provision of reverse onus of proof can damage relationships. All coalition members of the committee at that time signed the dissenting report.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can chuckle about it, but I think that one of the things that we need to look at is what the duties of an employer are and how he must exercise reasonableness. The normal processes should not be overturned. For instance, evidence was given by many people involved in the mining industry and in women's groups concerned about the prospect of foetal damage for women of child-bearing age working in the lead industry. It would seem to me that to say a woman should not work in the lead industry is discriminatory, but for the employer to have her do so would also be unreasonable if she were running a risk of foetal damage. There are areas in the veterinary industry too where women more than men are exposed to chances of disease or damage or infection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, those matters should not be set aside by this legislation to have a purist approach as to what is or what is not discriminatory. What is reasonable is a term recognised by the courts and well founded and established through many cases. If the employer is being unreasonable, the employee has an opportunity of proving that the employer is wrong. So what we are arguing here is that there should remain with the employee the prospect of proving that the employer was unreasonable rather than for the employer to have to defend a decision as reasonable. It opens up, in our view, areas not previously examined in discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the government has not been keen to go to the lengths that members of the committee were prepared to go to in regard to potential pregnancy. The government has only a general provision in these amendments to cover the prospect of or potential of pregnancy, whereas the recommendation of the dissenting members was that there should be a specific proposal that discrimination cannot take place on the grounds of potential pregnancy. Let me give the House an example of, say, a newly married couple seeking employment for the wife in a new suburb to which they had moved and an employer feeling that, because of her age, there was a prospect of the woman becoming pregnant and starting a family. It is our view that is not a matter that should concern the employer whatsoever. It is a matter for the couple to decide. To deny somebody the opportunity of employment on the notion that they may become pregnant is discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong recommendation of the coalition in regard to this report was that there should be specific measures in the act to stop that. The government has chosen to include them only in the general provisions. I think that is a weakening of the process. So, whilst the government can beat its chest and claim purity in some areas, it cannot in all areas on these proposed amendments. It has failed and its process is flawed. It would claim ours is also. If this report had been done properly, if the time had been spent more constructively by the now Attorney-General and members of the Australian Labor Party in the final stages of putting this report together, I believe the two sides of the House would have been closer together in finalising this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Back to Moses, no, or back to Arthur Calwell and many others. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to Eddie Ward the other day to illustrate something. I will just go back to 1983, to a question to the Prime Minister from Mrs Darling, who was then the member for Lilley, about discrimination. Mrs Darling said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Prime Minister give an assurance to Australian women that neither the Government's proposed sex discrimination Bill nor ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women will in any way discriminate against women who choose life within the family, will not force them to go out to work, separate them from their children or break up their families, as some people have recently been suggesting?</PARA>
<PARA>That was 1983. It is very interesting, with 12 years hindsight, to see the damage that this government has inflicted on the average family woman that wants to stay at home&mdash;that $68 a week disadvantage, to start with, in child care and other benefits for the woman with a family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listen to Mr Hawke's response in that circumstance of 1983. This is the non-discriminatory Prime Minister, and the course of action and commitment to non-discrimination, that the government had. Mr Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in our enthusiasm to eliminate those forms of discrimination, ignore the fact that a very large number of women see the total fulfilment of their aspirations and their happiness in terms of the family&mdash;the role of wife and mother, of sustainer and supporter, and the upbringer of children. It is a noble and appropriate role for those who see their total fulfilment in it. There is absolutely nothing that this Government will do which will in any way prejudice women who quite appropriately make that choice. Indeed, the range of policies that will be adopted by my Government will ensure that families and women discharging that role will be given the greatest opportunity of achieving fulfilment and satisfaction for them and those dependent upon them.</PARA>
<PARA>What a statement. How laughable Bob Hawke was, back in 1983, when he said that families would not suffer and he would not discriminate against families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at the tax scales. One has only to look at the provisions of child care, and the unlimited access to some funds: with an annual income of up to $360,000, in some instances, couples can gain access to government funding. But if a mum is at home with the kids she does not get it. We can see the discriminatory approach that the government has adopted in regard to families, and to women in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back to the legislation, because that diversion is an illustration of the way in which the Labor Party claims purity but, in the area of discrimination on the potential of pregnancy, has been less than pure and less than honest with the Australian community. Contained in the amendments that we are considering today are the repeal and the replacement of section 7 of the act, to include potential pregnancy as an unlawful ground of discrimination. As I have said, it was the coalition's proposal that there should be not a general provision but specific provisions in sections 5, 6 and 7. That was our recommendation and that was part of our dissenting report. The government has chosen to ignore that, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the explanatory memorandum states, another provision of the bill is to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">repeal section 33, the "special measures" provision, and replace it with a new provision which makes it clear that such measures do not amount to discrimination for the purposes of the Act and are designed to achieve equality of outcomes. For this reason the provision is also being moved from the exemptions division of the Act to the definitions division.</PARA>
<PARA>Another concerns combat related discrimination, such that women can, in fact, become part of the up-front combat part of the defence forces of Australia. I suppose that is non-discriminatory, but it seems a bit old-fashioned, because the Israeli army and the armies that have really got to do stuff tried to adopt a non-discriminatory approach to combat troops but, in face of actual operational processes, had to change that. So Australia is running behind the times. But we are going to make things work here, 10 years behind everywhere else, where they seem to have not worked so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations of the dissenting members was that this provision be not included, but the Attorney-General has chosen to go ahead. The defence forces have been compliant with the government in its view of the way in which women should play a full combat role in the defence of Australia. Some women may want to. But, in practice overseas, it has been found that that does not produce best results on the ground. So the Israeli army, for instance, has changed its provisions about women in combat zones, and that is now no longer the case. The government is behind the times, or chooses to appeal to its own particular captive group of supporters and is not prepared to think across the board. </PARA>

There are cultural reasons, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, knows. For a male to attend an Islamic women's swimming pool would not be contemplated, yet not to allow a male an equal opportunity is discriminatory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Originally when the government introduced the Sex Discrimination Bill in 1984 there was some controversy about it. We heard speeches then like we have just heard from the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The difficulty that opposition members have with a whole lot of their policies is that they are rooted in the 1950s. They would like to think that everything was like it was in the 1950s. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would like to think that Earlwood where he grew up in the 1950s is still like that in the 1990s. The member for Mitchell would like to think that women still had the same place in the world in the 1990s as they had in the 1950s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just heard a recitation of many of the remarks that we heard in 1984&mdash;but the government pressed ahead with this legislation in 1984 and we were proved right. The world has changed. It is an insane thing for a country such as Australia to adopt an approach that says that we will not have the same rights and opportunities for one half of the population as we have for the other half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People such as the member for Mitchell should look at their own families and see what the women, and particularly the younger women, think about these things. Women want to have a career. They want to have the same options as young men have. I remember the situation of my wife when she and I were going to school. We went to the same school. In the year that she left school, two of the girls in her class went to university and about eight or nine of the boys did. She and her girlfriend who went to university together are both still working and enjoying jobs that they found were very satisfying for them. A number of the other young women who went to school with them did not get a chance to achieve their potential until the Whitlam government came along in the 1970s and brought in better facilities to enable mature aged students to go to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the member for Mitchell and others bring up are these same old arguments. They say that the legislation does not go far enough. They will always find a few absurd and obscure exceptions and say that therefore the whole bill should be struck down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was right in 1984, and we are being proved right again today. The 1984 act gave effect to the government's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Australian legislation was broader in scope because it covered discrimination against either sex. The 1984 act has been used by men, which is something the member for Mitchell does not wish to notice. Approximately 632 complaints of the 7,397 that have been lodged since 1984 have been by men. If the member for Mitchell thinks this is some terrible thing because it is just being too helpful for women, I would put it that obviously, in the last 11 years at least, nearly 10 per cent of the people who have used the provisions of this act have been men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There might have been discrimination ranging across the whole of society that did not have redress in the past. However, the act provides a form of legal redress for those who have been subject to unreasonable forms of discrimination. It is also about encouraging those attitudinal changes throughout society. As I said earlier, I think we have been successful in changing some of those attitudinal problems&mdash;not those of unreconstructed people, such as the member for Mitchell. But I think we have seen a significant change in attitude in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government supported the act originally, but it also used this act in the environment of both a social and economic strategy. Social policies that we have put in place provide child care and family assistance paid directly to women caring for children. The national agenda for women demonstrates the government's commitment to the recognition of the importance of household labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment to social change was amplified through the ratification of ILO Convention 156 in March 1990. That convention aimed to minimise pressures faced by workers with family responsibilities. It provides that family responsibilities alone do not constitute a valid reason for discriminating and prevents such responsibilities restricting participation in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention is being supported by the government through activities other than those pertaining directly to the Sex Discrimination Act. In the Office of the Status of Women, the government funded a community education program to raise public knowledge of the ILO convention and its purposes. In the Department of Industrial Relations, the work and family unit was created to facilitate the implementation of the principles of the ILO convention across the community. It is also interesting to note that the ILO seeks to invoke the rights of paternity for males. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument put by the member for Mitchell that this is all some plot on the government's part to help only women is just not so. It is about discrimination across the board&mdash;whether discrimination against men or women. It just happens that, unfortunately, in the past the people who were kept out of work, career opportunities and a whole range of different kinds of participation in Australian life, were women&mdash;and the government is acting to redress that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 various amendments were made to the 1988 Industrial Relations Act. Those changes dealt with obligations under the convention relating to parental leave and discrimination on the grounds of parental responsibilities. The 1984 Sex Discrimination Act itself was amended in 1992 to prohibit employees from being dismissed on the grounds of family responsibility. In the economic environment we have also seen improvements: increased access to superannuation; a commitment to affirmative action strategies for women in employment; and strong promotion of equal access to education and training, especially in non-traditional sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, 15.2 per cent of apprenticeships were commenced by women, while in 1986-87 only 13.7 of apprenticeships were commenced by women. In those six years, we have seen greater participation by young women in apprenticeships. Before I came into this House, I worked as a technician for Telecom. In the years prior to my leaving that job, Telecom had its first intake of young women. I have to say that they had a marked effect on the way the blokes behaved at work&mdash;the males showed an improvement in attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factories and shops which were all-male environments tended to be pretty aggressive and vulgar and they brought out the worst in people. If the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) had worked in a place similar to that, even he would not have been able to overcome those difficulties as well as I did. Having young women on those jobs made the blokes think about some of the things they did. It improved the way they behaved as human beings, which I think is one of the unmentioned advantages of having a greater number of women taking up jobs that they had not normally done in the past. The increased proportion of women in jobs is also reflected in the professions and in managerial sections of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a movement of women into what were previously male dominated jobs as employers have realised that they can gain a lot from that. In 1971 I got elected to the local council. In those days, the council used to be able to advertise jobs as being specifically for a male or a female. Any job that paid more than about $20,000 was advertised as a male clerk's job. The council never advertised those jobs that paid a reasonable salary for women to apply for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After being there for about six months, I spoke to the town clerk about this. I asked him, `Why don't we just advertise jobs for clerks?' He said, `Because if you get women in these jobs, they won't stay, will they?' I asked him, `How do you know?' `Well, they just won't,' he answered. I replied, `I think you ought to start advertising these jobs as `clerks jobs' because at the next council meeting we are going to change the policy.' He said, `You won't get that through, Mr McLeay.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I did get that through. From then on, the advertisements were changed so that they were jobs for clerks, male or female, but the council got clever and put `male or female' in brackets. We attracted a stream of competent people who had never applied for those jobs before because the advertisements had been worded differently. A number of clever women got jobs in that local government authority, and many of them are still there. It struck me that the way in which we had been advertising was a stupid waste of potential. We were not looking across the whole group of people who were eligible for each job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary departments have been lacking in the same way. I think it is a shame that we do not have as many women at the SES level of the parliamentary departments as we do in the wider Public Service, although it is better now than it was some years ago. I might take a bit of credit for that because I used to kick them along a bit when I was the Speaker. It always struck me that the parliamentary departments were making the same mistake as the council. The parliament tended to have a lot of excellent women in the committee system, but those women never got to managerial positions in the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with some of the other parliamentary departments. Only recently have women got to managerial positions in the Hansard department here. The faces of Hansard that senators and members would see are the mainly female <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters. It is only in very recent times that a woman has been in the SES level of Hansard. I have always thought that the parliament itself was not presenting as good a face to the world on this sort of legislation as has the wider bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that is looked at by employers is the percentage of women who occupy part-time positions in the labour force. That figure has dropped from 77.6 per cent in 1983 to 74.4 per cent in 1993&mdash;a decrease of some three per cent. It indicates that positions held by women are improving in the wider work force. The number of women entering the work force has also increased. There is no doubt that women in all areas of the work force have progressed because of both attitudinal and legislative changes over the past 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is further information to suggest that legislation alone will not encourage women into positions if they are not given the support and respect that would accompany the position if it were held by a male. In many occupations employers put unnecessary demands on women employees that they would not put on male employees. It has also been my experience from talking to people that women in occupations tend to get less peer support than men do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 1 June reported on a recent survey of middle managers which found that 22 per cent of female managers quit due to being treated differently by their peers and males of equivalent rank, 20 per cent quit due to not fitting into the male dominated corporate culture, and only seven per cent of them quit due to their responsibilities to children. So the old, tired saw which the town clerk at Marrickville used to me of, `You can't give these women decent jobs because they'll go off and have babies. That's a bit of a waste, isn't it?' has gone, and I think people have accepted that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a more insidious obstacle to women reaching positions of authority is that women do not get the same support by management as do men, that management does not give women the same training programs as they give men and that there is always this thought in the back of their minds, `She might want to go home to the children.' Well, so what!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have the societal view of the member of Mitchell which says that women should be the primary carer in families but we also want them to have equal opportunity in their employment and other forms of endeavour, then, unless men decide that they will take on more of that parenting role, employers and society have to accept that women managers are doing two jobs, and take that into account. If we do not take that into account, it is just as phoney as the old argument, `You shouldn't give them a job because they go and have babies.' The people who used to run that argument often forgot about the other side of it: who started the baby. It is a silly attitude for management not to promote people throughout an organisation just on raw ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a manager's point of view, I have always found in my years in parliament that female managers tend to be&mdash;pound for pound and job for job&mdash;better than male managers. I have only ever employed a few men on my staff. The reason I have employed women is that they tend to be smarter at the job they do, and they tend to get less flustered than men do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One significant advantage women tend to bring to management positions is that they are inclined to be consensus gatherers, while men tend to want to win the argument. Consensus gatherers might take a little bit longer to get to the answer, but will get it right the first time. In many jobs that I have seen, particularly in the public sector, it takes a lot longer to fix a stuff-up than it takes to rationally come to a proper solution in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise that women can bring to jobs sometimes different and better approaches than men can. It is important to have those proper mixes for our development as a society going into the 21st century. I do not think there is anything wrong with this legislation changing the onus of proof, because in the past it has just been too damned hard to get some of those attitudinal changes that should have occurred happen more sensibly and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House. It is a shame that we hear the same old arguments trotted out by the opposition in 1995 that we heard in 1984, even though a number of the newer members on the opposition side are probably more in tune than their more senior colleagues in the opposition are with the points of view put forward by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in this bill.

However, the government withdrew the proposition for a bill of rights some years ago, and hopefully that will not be brought back into the legislative program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note and commend the Attorney-General on the reaffirmation of the position that the Sex Discrimination Act is based on the merit principle and not quotas. He went to some effort to put this in his speech. One of the key arguments I have personally been concerned about is that there is a mixture of attitudes towards merit compared with the quota argument of achieving numbers of females in the work force or in particular workplaces. I also note the emphasis put on the new preamble of the bill in the government's endeavour to bring about some changes in the whole legislative program in this area, which is obviously fairly difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen a continued intrusion of the law into the marketplace, the home, the schoolroom and the workplace. The moves towards equal opportunity legislation, sex discrimination laws, racial vilification and unfair dismissal are all symptoms of this movement. The bill currently under consideration is a further step in the government's moves to a more regulated, legalistic and proscriptive culture in the workplace, in educational institutions and in other walks of life. We observe even tighter controls over individuals designated to regulate forms of private human activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key features of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1995 are the insertion of the preamble to the bill, as I mentioned; the reversal of the onus of proof for establishing an indirect discrimination claim; and the introduction of potential pregnancy as grounds for a discrimination claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new preamble is a symbolic statement which sets out the principle of equality before the law, which I presume all Australians would have anyhow. One might wonder why such a preamble was necessary. Is it the government's belief that Australia's judicial system is failing in this important regard? Equal treatment before the law is one of the cornerstones of our legal tradition. Making bland statements in support of such a central principle in the preamble to the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill almost suggests that the law is treating people differently according to their sex&mdash;a notion which should be rejected out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insertion of potential pregnancy as grounds for discrimination is most likely unnecessary. Discriminating on the grounds of potential pregnancy is arguably already included in the current provisions relating to pregnancy. The most fundamental change brought about by this amendment is the reversal of the burden of proof in cases where direct discrimination is claimed. Indirect discrimination refers to circumstances where a seemingly neutral criterion or condition is unreasonable and discriminatory in its effect on a particular sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is effectively responding to the small numbers of claims under this provision in the past by simply making such a discrimination easier to prove. The central assumption behind the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill is that, where claims of indirect discrimination have not been made, the parliament should see this as not a social achievement but a fault of law which must be rectified. At the 10th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act held in Sydney last year the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) bemoaned the fact that since the advent of the legislation there had been only 11 claims of indirect discrimination under the act. On this occasion the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . due to the complexity of the Act's test for indirect discrimination and the lack of public understanding of this issue, there have been only 11 such complaints in the Act's ten year operation.</PARA>
<PARA>While the Prime Minister glowed with pride that 7,000 claims of direct discrimination had been lodged since 1984, the small number of indirect discrimination cases was an obvious disappointment to him. In other words, good legislation is legislation which stimulates the most litigation, bringing forward an army of complainants all with some reason to feel hardly done by. This mentality extends beyond the area of sex discrimination, cutting across areas like racial vilification, native title claims and even the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just ask the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). He contends that the government's unfair dismissal laws have been a huge success&mdash;that was, of course, until last week when he changed some aspects of them. In their 13 months of operation, over 8,500 claims have been made. The stockpile of claims grows by 700 per month. Extra staff were taken on at the Industrial Relations Commission to handle the workload. The steady flow of aggrieved litigants is seen as a momentous triumph by the government&mdash;a sign that the laws are really working, as we have people in the courts complaining and arguing their cases of unfair dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to this astounding caseload has been that the terminated employees do not bear the onus of proving their dismissal was unjust; employers have the task of proving otherwise&mdash;which is similar to this legislation. It is exactly that reversal of the burden of proof which forms the core of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill, which is before the House today. The provisions of this bill will fundamentally alter the way in which claims of indirect discrimination are to be handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whereas in the past complainants had to show that the alleged discriminator&mdash;for example, the employer&mdash;had imposed `an ostensibly neutral criterion which has a disproportionate and unreasonable impact on a particular sex', it will now fall to employers to refute this. Employers will have to establish that such a criterion or condition which is allegedly indirectly discriminate is reasonable in the circumstances. Previously it was the complainant who had to prove that the criteria or condition was unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the law: justice for women</EMPHASIS>. It was also touched upon in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, which other members have referred to. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, although coming from a government dominated committee, is most likely not supported by either all of the government members of that committee or the government itself. The dissenting report of that committee compiled by coalition members states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the Sub-committee was accorded just 1 1/2 hours to consider the whole Report demeans Australian women and treats with contempt the process of Parliamentary Committee Inquiry. Only 4 Members of the Government Party attended the final meeting of the Committee. In effect, these four have determined the Committee's recommendations although the actual attendance of Opposition Members at that meeting was greater in number. This meant the Report was approved in effect by four of a total membership of fifteen. It was not a representative meeting nor did it carry the endorsement of the Government Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, the report recommended a reversal of the onus of proof for cases of indirect discrimination. While some witnesses who appeared before the committee justified the reversal of the onus of proof on the grounds that employers are in a better position to justify alleged discrimination, others, like the Confederation of Australian Industry, rightly pointed out that such a move would invite spurious claims of discrimination which employers would then bear the burden of disproving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the increase in claims, be they spurious or otherwise, would no doubt be greeted by the government as proof that its laws were working effectively. The government would draw attention to the mass of employers who had been taken to task for their alleged indirect discrimination, usually against women, citing this as a victory for its equal opportunity agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophy which underpins this approach is that legislative, proscriptive and legalistic measures are the best means of solving the supposed ills of society. For instance, in Victoria the recent Equal Opportunity Act increases the number of grounds on which discrimination can be claimed in Victoria from seven to 14. The new act makes illegal any discrimination on the grounds of age, industrial activity, lawful sexual activity, physical features, pregnancy, status as a carer and personal association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the media have shown an obsession with the clauses relating to lawful sexual activity, employers in Victoria are more worried about the provisions dealing with physical features and the clause concerning third parties in relation to job applications and comments that are able to be made about prospective employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new state law, discrimination on the grounds of height, weight, size or other bodily characteristics will be unlawful, casting real doubt about the employer's ability to stipulate standards of personal appearance. Under clause 100, a person must not request someone else to supply information which could be used to form the basis of discrimination against another person. This will be taken to include information supplied orally as well as in writing. One can see the impact of that. Under this clause a telephone call or comment about a prospective employee may be considered to be discriminatory. The ambit of clause 100 is unknown, but potentially far reaching. In effect, asking third parties for information about a job applicant could prove to be the basis of a discrimination claim, even if that information was never used and no discrimination actually took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen the number of claims under the Equal Opportunity Act in Victoria rise by 321 per cent over the last eight years. The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that it has observed some people double-dipping, and in some cases even triple-dipping, by making use of the various avenues through which they can claim victimisation. VECCI says that a number of litigants have recently taken their employers on with an unfair dismissal claim in the federal jurisdiction, followed by an anti-discrimination claim at the state level and a stress related Workcover claim to top it all off. What happens under these legalistic arrangements is that those employees who see some advantage under the law take every chance they can to use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unsavoury aspect of this process is that governments at all levels not only make such courses of action available to aggrieved litigants but also actively encourage legal remedies as the answer to social issues. The effect of this is to fuel the perception that these people are the victims of a terrible wrongdoing who are in need of special legislative assistance. Rather than achieving equality, this mentality fosters dependency and promotes hostility and confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a theme which has received some attention in Victoria with the publication of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The First Stone</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a book by well-known feminist Helen Garner&mdash;which deals with the dismissal of a former master of Ormond College following claims of sexual harassment of two female students. Helen Garner's book deals with the claims made by the two students that the master had touched one on the breast and made improper advances to the other in the privacy of his office.

Mrs Garner's account focuses less on determining the truth of the girls' claims and more on the question of whether the construction of women as helpless victims has undone that which it took several years for feminists of her ilk to achieve, namely, a sense of mutual respect and genuinely equal treatment of women. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Dr Mead, Helen Garner's book represents a backlash against the political gains of contemporary feminism.

Unlike Garner, she refuses to rank Dr Gregory's suffering higher than the young woman's. It simply does not weigh with her that the young woman's suffering amounted to having her breasts squeezed, and Dr Gregory having his life destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Robert Manne piece is an apt description of the controversy within the feminist movement between those who seek to portray women as victims and those whose fight for equality has included a recognition that women are competent, capable and potentially powerful. Andrew McIntyre, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in March this year, points to the fact that whereas the feminist movement had previously sought to break down social barriers and institutional barriers which discriminated against women, such as the men's and women's lounges at universities, emphasis is now on erecting such barriers once again. Women's rooms have sprung up at university campuses all over the country. The Sydney McIvers Ladies Baths was granted an exemption under the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act to exclude men from bathing there and a series of women's only gyms is being established throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the Labor Party's aim was to remove forms of discrimination against women. By 1984 they were instituting discrimination of their own, with a 35 per cent quota for women in winnable seats by the year 2002. Emphasis is being placed not on achieving equality of opportunity, but on portraying women as being in need of special measures and favourable treatment. Just as the welfare state encourages the view that large sections of the population are incapable of looking after themselves, feminist movements the world over seem to be putting out the message that women are in need of some sort of special protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments have taken up the cause by encouraging women to make use of the law and to take their complaints to the courts. This recourse by women to the courts is basically what Helen Garner railed against in her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The First Stone</EMPHASIS>. Yet this is the mentality of the federal government, which seeks to encourage more and more litigation and more and more complaints by reversing the onus of proof for actions under the Sex Discrimination Act. The government is effectively telling women that they are letting the side down by not bringing forward more cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act before the parliament, whilst I appreciate the sentiments of what the government is trying to do, encourages this attitude in those people who feel they have been wrongly done by. It will give them a legalistic framework in which they can put forward their endeavours in the court and other areas where they can defend discrimination taking place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the broad expressions of support for at least the intent of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill if not for each individual amendment contained in it. I would like to briefly refer to some of the comments made by some of the members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first comment relates to criticisms which were made of the process the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs followed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report. This report was particularly launched by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) who, at the very least, is being somewhat ungenerous in his comments and maybe a bit mean spirited. I served with the honourable member on that particular committee during the last parliament. I can honestly say that, on the whole, I thought our relationship was quite good, constructive and cooperative. Obviously the member for Mitchell is not of the same view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the criticisms that were made&mdash;the fact that the whole report took 2 1/2 years of taking evidence and that after 45 minutes of deliberation it was rushed through with not enough time being given to people to consider it&mdash;selective memory is really being applied to the process. Being the chair of the committee, I obviously recall the process quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that as the various sections of the report were prepared by the committee secretariat they were supplied to members of the subcommittee. There was a full opportunity for members to have their views taken into account in the actual drafting of the report, and various amendments to the text of the report flowed from that process. The member for Mitchell and other members of the committee, particularly opposition members, had that opportunity and availed themselves of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the final formal considerations of the report were quite short but that was as a result of a great time constraint imposed on the committee by the government or by government members. That is how long the deliberations took after we had already gone through a process of consideration and people giving their views as the text was being prepared. So for members to come forward now, years later, and start making these criticisms not only shows a very selective memory as to the actual conduct of the matter but also, at the very least, is somewhat uncharitable and ungenerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting onto the more substantive criticism, most of the debate revolved around the issue regarding the changed definition of `indirect discrimination'&mdash;and that is the subject on which the opposition is moving a second reading amendment to the bill. The starting point for the opposition's criticisms is that changing the definition, removing part of the current test and putting that in the hands of a respondent, amounts to a reversal of the onus of proof in proving indirect discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us at least be factual and honest about it. The onus is on the complainant to prove that there is discrimination, that the complainant has suffered as a result of this discrimination and that there are conditions applying which apply to one gender or the other which is discriminatory in comparison to the other gender. The onus remains on the complainant to prove the basic point that there is discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being changed in the current definition is that it is then on the complainant to go on and prove that not only is there discrimination but also the discrimination is itself unreasonable. The proposed test is that the complainant has the responsibility of proving and carrying the onus of showing that there is in fact discrimination. It is then upon the respondent to show that there is no discrimination but that it is reasonable that this condition, practice or requirement be there. It should be structured in that way because the respondent&mdash;the employer, the company or the corporation involved in a particular industry or a particular enterprise&mdash;obviously knows why the particular practice or condition is there. They are the ones who are imposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the condition is there as a safety requirement, if it is there because it is the industry's standard and it is completely out of bounds in terms of cost or competitiveness for an individual business or a whole industry not to have such a condition&mdash;if it is there for any of these legitimate reasons&mdash;then that is perfectly justified. But surely the onus is on the respondent to effectively show this. We know in practice that the way the provisions often operate is that the complainant will have to try to get some evidence to support this point and secure it out of the respondent in the first place. As the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) said in his speech, it would probably come out in the pleading process if the matter finally went to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that it is a terrible thing that this part of the test should be in the hands of respondents. The government is not saying that it is an irrelevant consideration that there are good reasons for a discriminatory provision. All we are saying is that it is up to the respondent to show why it is there. We are not simply removing the idea of reasonableness. We are ensuring that the complainant has the onus of proving that there has been discrimination and that the complainant has been the victim of that discrimination. It is then open to the respondent, by way of a defence, to show that the condition is reasonable and, in establishing the defence, the respondent will say that questions of costs, safety, efficiency and competitiveness are relevant, and that is why the condition is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is purely in the interests of the respondent to be able to argue those points. It will not be a steel worker or a clerical assistant who will be trying to argue why those particular conditions are imposed. It is the employer or company that knows why the conditions are there. I do not believe that it is at all unreasonable that the measure should be structured in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Mitchell raised concerns about the lead industry in his speech. He said that these conditions are there for safety reasons. It is perfectly reasonable if there is a risk to an unborn child that there be limitations on women's involvement in the lead industry. That is not an unreasonable view to take. This issue has been argued before Australian courts. In 1993, the full Federal Court in the case of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Mount Isa Mines suggested how this issue should be handled. The suggested approach is that which is largely incorporated in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a particular industry, such as the lead industry, where safety considerations come into play, the appropriate approach for the respondent is to seek from the human rights commission an administrative exemption from the operation of the act. Lo and behold that is exactly what has happened. The commission has granted exemptions in Victoria and South Australia. Therefore, the scheme works. This means that this industry can apply to the commission, argue its case and then, if it has a reasonable case, be granted an exemption. Is this not terrible? This is actually how the act is supposed to operate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says, `Why change it?' We are bringing our legislation into line with the legislation which operates in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania, which has just passed this legislation. The Tasmanian legislation does not have the reasonableness requirement for pregnancy. The newest legislation in the country does not do what the honourable member for Mitchell argues it should do. This amending legislation simply brings our legislation into line with the legislation which applies around Australia. Again, I do not think that is too unreasonable of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other criticisms were launched about the special measures provision. One line of argument from the opposition was that the government is not going far enough and that recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report on equality before the law said that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner should have the ability to issue a certificate saying, `This particular practice is a special measure. Off you go; carry out that particular program or run that particular scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government thinks there are a few problems with that, given that the commission is the body that ultimately has some sort of responsibility in an even-handed and attached way to be hearing complaints which may be against a special measure. It is discriminatory for it to be prejudging the matter. Maybe that is a problem but, no doubt, arguments can be made in favour of it. The Law Reform Commission, which is an august body, believed there were merits in the proposal and argued for it. The government has not rejected it out of hand; rather we have said, as we respond fully to the Law Reform Commission's report, that we will put our mind to this particular criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we have good legislation here in the form of the Sex Discrimination Act. It is legislation which has provided many thousands of Australians with a useful and effective remedy in particular cases of discrimination which they have encountered&mdash;most commonly in employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee, which took evidence from a large number of witnesses and which received a huge number of submissions, produced a major report. It is one of the largest reports that a parliamentary committee has ever undertaken. The process took 2 1/2 years, despite criticisms that it was all pushed through in 45 minutes. Sections of the report&mdash;the honourable member for Mitchell might recall this&mdash;were circulated to individual members as the report was being written. All members, particularly opposition members, had an opportunity to put in their comments. The text and recommendations were then altered to account for these comments that we had received. That obviously did not occur in every case. If we all agreed on everything, we would all be in the same political party, I suppose. Obviously, there are some disagreements between us. That is why we are on different sides of the chamber. But the vast majority of the recommendations in that report gained bipartisan support. I think only a handful did not receive that support. The actual text of the report and the process of its drafting was very strongly agreed upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject these criticisms&mdash;I think they are very mean spirited&mdash;that the whole thing was rammed through in 1 1/2 hours or 45 minutes. It resulted from a huge process where there was ample opportunity for members to have their say. As I said, I am disappointed that these criticisms have been made. My memory of the committee process is that it was pretty cooperative. Opposition and government members got on fairly well and did attempt to approach the process in a bipartisan manner. As the chair of the committee, I tried to approach the whole exercise with that spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, I believe it is good legislation. I do not believe that the substantive criticism on the indirect discrimination provisions actually stands up to much scrutiny. I notice that it will go to a Senate committee. I do not mind that at all. I am quite happy for the arguments to be aired before a Senate committee and for people to give their evidence. That is fine by me because I think it is legislative change which will stand up to scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members have mentioned, this legislation has been quite a long time in coming. I also note that this is stage 2. We have already had amendments flowing from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> report some little time ago. This has been on track. It was tabled in the parliament in the last session. So it has moved along. Stage 3 is also relatively advanced as well. So the legislation has moved along. I believe this is good legislation, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the decision by Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, not to sign a Labor Party petition condemning the resumption of French nuclear testing, despite that petition being signed by the Prime Minister and even by Senator Gareth Evans. Does the minister accept that the refusal by the Minister for Defence to sign the petition is sending an ambiguous message to France about the strength of Australia's protest? Is it not also obvious that it is more than a coincidence that the one minister who refused to sign the petition is the one minister who opposed the downgrade of defence ties with France as part of Australia's response to French nuclear tests?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2506" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is absolutely no ambiguity in so far as the French government and people are concerned about the attitudes of this government to the issue of French nuclear testing. That ambiguity only exists in the mind of the opposition. The Australian government's position has been made amply clear again very recently in a letter, effectively to the French people by the Prime Minister, that was published prominently in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Monde</EMPHASIS> in the last day or so, and it has been made amply clear by Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Ray to their various French counterparts at different points of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French government has the clear understanding that Australians and the Australian government are of one view as far as French nuclear testing is concerned, and they are also amply aware, because this is an issue that is not a new one on the agenda for relations between Australia and France, that, since this government has been in office, we have had an objection to their testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific, and we have sought to put in place regional arrangements which would effectively prohibit it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That you personally well recognised that those regional arrangements would indeed have an impact on testing was a reason why you yourself opposed, in the 1980s, the position that we adopted on the nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. I do not know what your reason was for doing that at that stage, because it could not possibly have been Western security interests. As I have said here before, the French nuclear deterrent has had nothing to do with Western security interests but, in fact, represents a declaration of lack of faith by the French government of the day that developed the force de frappe in the effectiveness of the United States and Western deterrent against the former Soviet Union. So you must have had some other set of reasons for adopting the view you have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French government, of course, has been the subject&mdash;as have all other governments&mdash;of consistent lobbying by the Australian government, with the comprehensive test ban agreement a matter for active international consideration, as with many other nuclear arms control measures like the non-proliferation treaty. Senator Evans has played a leading role in affairs over the last four or five years in reaching, in the case of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a successful conclusion and, in the face of the comprehensive test ban treaty, what we hope will be a successful conclusion. So he is worthy of praise in this community for the intellectual effectiveness of his argument in this area over a very lengthy period of time now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude where I began: there is no ambiguity in our presentation to the French people and the French government of where we stand on the French nuclear testing issue.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV5">Mr ADAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Does the government stand by the no disadvantage test in the Industrial Relations Act?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2506" SPEAKER="Brereton The Hon L.J." NAMEID="5T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let there be no doubt about this: the no disadvantage test is one of the fundamental cornerstones of the federal Industrial Relations Reform Act. Under the no disadvantage test, workers are guaranteed that, when they negotiate their enterprise bargaining agreements, they will not suffer any overall reduction in their total wages and conditions. What is more, all agreements are to be publicly ratified by an independent umpire, namely, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Through these processes workers are guaranteed a fair and equitable system&mdash;one with a comprehensive award safety net underpinning the whole of the bargaining process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth comparing that process with the opposition's Jobsback. Jobsback has four miserly, miserable minimum conditions: four weeks annual leave, 10 days non-cumulative sick leave, an hourly rate of pay&mdash;not even a weekly rate of pay, but a miserable hourly rate of pay&mdash;and unpaid maternity leave. They are the only four conditions set down in Jobsback. What a shamefully inadequate package it is!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really does not matter how hard the member for Flinders tries&mdash;no matter where he goes or no matter how hard he tries to dress this Jobsback wolf in sheep's clothing&mdash;it is not possible for him to sell the Jobsback package. All the platitudes and buzz words about so-called safety nets and opting in and opting out cannot disguise that the opposition's recipe is nothing short of an industrial relations nightmare.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth asking what is the real policy that the opposition stands for. The member for Higgins, who just interjected, said last week that the opposition stands for the safety net. That is what he said. He said, `We are for the safety net.' Sure, when it is a safety net with holes big enough to drop an elephant through. Some safety net that is!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last weekend the member for Flinders told us that unions would not be able to appear when agreements are ratified. That is what he said. We all know what that is code for: take the contract or take the sack deals. Deals will be ratified in secret&mdash;with no public processes at all&mdash;by a commission that has had its very teeth pulled. We have a better chance of seeing Elvis before Christmas than we have of seeing the opposition reveal in detail its IR policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is for certain: under our government, we have a fair industrial relations system where neither side is advantaged over the other. Accord Mark VIII underpins that process, with its genuine safety net adjustments especially targeted at those least well off in the community, as well as assistance for families, superannuation for all and maintenance of a comprehensive award safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only today, we have seen reports about a further drop in the rate of industrial disputation. Cast your mind back to last year when the Industrial Relations Reform Act was introduced. One opposition member after another got up in this place and said that it was a recipe for industrial mayhem. Of course, the opposite has happened since that act was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the opposition, we will get mayhem all right. There is no doubt about that. Workers will be forced to take individual contracts whether they like those contracts or not. We would have a commission with no power whatsoever to reject shonky deals. We would have the abolition of the no disadvantage test&mdash;the test that those sitting opposite hate. We know what the opposition stands for, and the Australian workers know what the opposition stands for. It stands for a return to the law of the industrial jungle. Nothing could be more utterly shameful.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the French government is concerned about the views of the Australian government and the Australian people on the matter of its testing, it is thoroughly well aware that this country and this government objects to the stand it is taking and the course of action that it intends to pursue. It is also thoroughly aware that it is the policy of the Australian government to mobilise opinion in this region against those tests. It is aware that the government has had a certain amount of success in that regard so far and that the forum was prepared to have Senator Evans as its interlocutor with the French government on this matter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0G4">Mr CUNNINGHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware of a recent claim that commencements in employment programs are being deliberately delayed? Is there any substance to these claims?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2508" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the assertions. They relate to the new work opportunities program, which is an important program under the government's Working Nation initiatives. Like so many of the opposition claims concerning Working Nation, they are totally without substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New work opportunities is a labour market program which is critical to getting the numbers of long-term unemployed down. The success of it, and other programs' contribution to that achievement, is evidenced by the fact that over the last 12 months, while unemployed numbers have fallen 11 per cent, the long-term unemployed numbers have fallen almost 21 per cent. This shows the benefit of targeted measures, including those of new work opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New work opportunities will play an even more important role because it is now growing at the rate of 2,500 people per month. That is a much stronger rate of growth than previously because communities are now aware of the program. The member for McMillan well knows of its benefit, as does the member for Page with whose area consultative committee I had the opportunity to meet earlier today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this program is not just confined to this side of the House. There are also members on the other side of the House who understand the importance of these programs. The member for Lyne is one of those members. At a later stage today, the House will have the opportunity to hear him applauding the initiatives being undertaken by his area consultative committee in embracing the new work opportunities program under the Working Nation initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why these programs are so significant is that they actually respond to what communities want, and they are resourced. In fact, the Working Nation programs are resourced to the tune of in excess of $2 billion for each of the next three years. It is interesting that, when the member for Lyne was supporting this program, he was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Port Macquarie News</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 19 May as having said in support of the Working Nation initiatives that he had contacted me outlining his support:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . saying that regardless of who won the next election the program would go on as both sides of politics had guaranteed the program their support.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the member for Lyne said. What does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have to say? On 20 June, in one of those doorstop interviews, he was pressed on the point, in responding to the budget, `Tell us where you would be prepared to cut?' He finally was prepared to nominate a program. This has been a long time coming, but on 20 June he did. The only programs that he nominated would be cut were `many of the Working Nation programs; there is significant room for savings'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has he told other members of the coalition of his intention to cut these programs? I believe there is an obligation on the part of the opposition to indicate which programs it would cut and by how much. I note a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today that the Liberal policies are secret, to be discussed at a poll meeting tonight. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meetings of Opposition frontbenchers tonight and tomorrow . . . are expected to finalise a raft of policies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The policies that are included are health, family tax and industrial relations policies. There is no mention of employment policies; no mention of those programs important to get people back into work; and no mention of education and training policies, just as there was no mention of them in the so-called famous headland speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder opposition frontbenchers are keeping their colleagues in the dark. Their colleagues are running around the country saying they would support these programs, but those who have carriage of putting opposition policies together have absolutely no commitment to them, despite the very effectiveness of them and despite the fact that regions are responding to them. I suggest to members on the other side of the House that, if they are serious about these programs working, they should get their side to change or tell their regions to vote Labor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate that has developed in our country and in other countries about the impact of the so-called information revolution, one of the key themes has been the risk of the danger of having a new division of society between the information rich and the information poor. It is this government's belief that it is imperative that we avoid such an outcome. As a consequence, a number of initiatives have been undertaken to try to achieve that effect and to ensure that those who are disadvantaged in our society come to be beneficiaries rather than victims of these very major changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In pursuance of that, my portfolio has an initiative called the Community Information Network, which was first announced in the Working Nation statement last year. Basically, that involves establishing on a pilot basis at a number of sites throughout the country an information infrastructure&mdash;based on Internet principles and the best possible software we can get&mdash;which is designed to provide low income people, in particular those receiving social security payments, with access to a range of services; a range of information about their local community and what government has to offer; and a vehicle whereby they can make use of information technology to take on their own initiatives on a collaborative or an individual basis. In general it will allow us to test how much benefit can be provided to people in that circumstance, many of whom are not computer literate and obviously need systems which are intuitive and user friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow I will formally launch the Community Information Network.

Most of the matters that he raised, particularly the quarantine matter, I heard Senator Collins cover in an answer in the Senate. If I can recollect accurately Senator Collins remarks, they went to the nature of the condition in which Canadian pork had to appear in this country and that it had to be refrigerated and then immediately cooked on entry to this country. Those dual processes, it is believed, as I understand it, eliminate all threats associated with the importation of Canadian pig meat. But I refer the honourable member to Senator Collins's answer for more detail on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then went on to ask about what other steps the government might take in regard to the importation of that pig meat. Senator Collins also addressed those matters in the Senate. Again, I refer the honourable member to his answers. As I recollect his answers, they contained the following information: Senator Collins was aware of the concerns that the industry had expressed and he pointed out in his answer that many of the concerns being experienced by the industry are not products so much of the entry of Canadian meat but a product of the impact of the drought on feed prices and that very substantial increases in those prices was imposing very large burdens. He had words of comfort for the industry as far as that is concerned. The ABARE estimates are that for the pig industry there will be a substantial fall during this year in the price of feed stock based on its assessment of what is happening to Australian grain industries as a result of an apparent breaking of the drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins was also pleased to point out that a decision to import grain recently had had a fairly  substantial effect immediately after that decision was taken on the price of feed grains produced here.

He also suggested to them that he had had advice from the Industry Commission that it would be possible to do a very rapid study of the proposition that the Canadians were dumping and that such a study would be necessary preparatory to any further action in that regard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to report to the House that this week marks the culmination of the government's landmark reform of industrial relations in the coal industry. The federal legislation that was passed by this House last December, abolishing the Coal Industry Tribunal and giving responsibility for all coal industrial relations matters to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, is to be proclaimed by the Governor-General on Friday of this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today complementary legislation, passed by the New South Wales parliament, was proclaimed by the New South Wales Governor. As the old arrangements were also based on complementary federal-state legislation, this step by New South Wales was essential to the operation of our reforms, and for that I am particularly grateful to the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Jeff Shaw. His commitment to reform far exceeds that of his predecessor, Mrs Kerry Chikarovski.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this means is that the full mainstreaming of coal industry industrial relations can take place on target from 1 July 1995. On that day, the sun will set for the last time on the very last of our specialised industrial relations tribunals&mdash;one that dates right back to 1946. That we have been able to achieve this key reform, and do so without any industrial action, owes a great deal to the cooperation and the maturity of the unions and the employers in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I pay tribute to both the unions and employers for their contribution to the process. It gives us in government great confidence that both can work together in pursuing workplace reform within the mainstream of our IR system. I underline the importance of the reform to Australia's greatest export industry by quoting from a letter I received on Christmas Eve last from none other than the Chairman of the Australian Coal Association, Mr Bob Humphris, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform is vital to the ability of the coal industry to meet the challenges of international competition. It is a most significant step forward in micro-economic reform and should be recognised as one of the government's major achievements in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter includes rich praise indeed from an organisation that is not known for its Labor sympathies.

Only Labor governments can deliver the sort of accord that we saw last week, guaranteeing worker protection, guaranteeing industrial peace, guaranteeing low inflation, guaranteeing workplace reform. In answer to the interjection from the opposition benches, could I point out to the House that it was Ian Macphee, the last Liberal with any ability to talk to working men and women in this country, who once advocated the reform of the Coal Industry Tribunal. Yet in usual coalition style he was overruled on that occasion by a gutless leader, egged on by his cronies in the National Party. That one instance says a great deal about the history of the postwar period. While the coalition talks about reforms, they have neither the nerve nor the nous to deliver those reforms and their reform bravado lasts about as long as their periods in opposition. It is always left to Labor governments to make the necessary reforms and to make them in the least disruptive fashion. The mainstreaming of the coal industry is just one such instance.

Despite attempts by the opposition to criticise this initiative from time to time&mdash;and I acknowledge that the honourable member for Lyne is an exception in this matter&mdash;Working Nation has been, and continues to be, a great success providing an all encompassing framework for Australians. Young Australians are, of course, sharing in the benefits of Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of Working Nation, commencing from January this year, the youth training initiative and the youth training allowance provide a comprehensive set of policies designed to deliver income support, intensive case management, labour market or vocational training places and jobsearch assistance. Again, the special needs of individual young people are being catered for through the youth training allowance, which takes into consideration difficulties such as homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test of the policies of the government can be easily measured in the success of the results. Some 580,000 jobs have been created over the last two years. The fall in unemployment in 1994 was the largest annual decrease in 30 years. Within this context, youth unemployment is declining rapidly. It has declined by about 17 per cent in the last 12 months. While total long-term unemployment has declined by 21 per cent over the last 12 months, the drop in youth long-term unemployment is a full 44 per cent. Year 12 retention rates have risen from around one in three to 75 per cent, with most young people these days moving into other types of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has driven this revolution with substantial funding increases. Federal expenditure on school education has increased in real terms by 55 per cent since we came to office, and this year it will reach a record $3 billion. Vocational education and training will receive $673 million in federal funds this year, and the budget continued the government's commitment to $70 million of annual growth funding. In conclusion, it is beyond question that the policies of this government for young people have worked, and are continuing to work, in the best interests of young Australians.</PARA>

Will the minister admit that this is damning evidence of the failure of the government's waterfront reforms&mdash;a failure that is adding to the already appalling problems facing the pig producers protesting outside the parliament today?

It seems to me that it provides and has provided something way beyond a basic first aid service.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time, the matters that you have gone to, such as occupational exposure testing, heart risk monitoring, and so on, have been added by the nurses themselves as part of that program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me open my remarks by making the obvious point that there are a lot of pig producers in this town at the moment who reckon that the person who ought to be in here to debate this issue today is Australia's best known ex pig farmer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He ought to be here to tell us why, having invested a lot of money in the pork industry, he got out of it. It might be very interesting for him to throw some light on why he decided his investment was misplaced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister obviously thought when he began that he had picked a winner and that he had got himself into an industry that had a great future. It was an industry with an emerging export focus and growth potential. It was, if you like, a real manifestation of his government's endless rhetoric about the need for a new value adding culture that he reckoned was ready to sweep the Australian food industry, particularly in relation to exports into Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what happened? When the Prime Minister sat down and examined the industry, he discovered that owning a piggery, like owning any productive enterprise in this country, was a sure-fire way to lose money, not gain it. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister found that there were very real and significant barriers to securing a decent return on investment in the pig industry in this country. Yet that is the sort of environment that this government forces the agricultural industry&mdash;and, for that matter, small business in general&mdash;in this country to operate in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister came into this place the other day and called us a mob of `scrubbers'&mdash;I do not know how many people on our side picked that up&mdash;and reckoned that we would not have 2c to rub together. That is pretty gratuitous advice coming from somebody who, as far as we understand, was able to invest a minimal amount of money in this new growth industry while everybody else&mdash;the people who work hard in it; the people who are locked into it&mdash;is going broke. He then gets out of the industry and, from what we understand, apparently makes a great deal of money out of it. Again, it falls into the same category as the remarks he made when he said, `This is as good as it ever gets for the small business sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with the mob opposite is that it does not understand what it is like to operate a business. It does not understand that it is all about cost competitiveness, about being able to compete and about being able to get in there and have a go without having your hands tied behind your back. That is certainly a situation that the pig industry has faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister decided to off-load his interests in that industry because he looked at what was needed to secure the industry's future potential. He squibbed it. He reckoned that the government could not put in place the reforms that are so obviously needed&mdash;labour market reform, reduction of taxes on expenditure and transport reform, which came up in the House today. They are all necessary precursors to the revitalisation of the pig industry, and the meat industry in general, in this country. So, stuck like the proverbial pig in a poke, the Prime Minister got out; he sold his shares. He is probably as happy as a pig in mud having made that decision and having secured his windfall gain. Having got out, he has left his would-be pig farming counterparts wallowing, however, in a mire of economic despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all ought to recognise just how severe the problem is for pork producers. According to the Australian Pork Corporation, in April alone some seven per cent of producers left the industry. In 1960&mdash;not so terribly long ago; well within the memory of some people in this place&mdash;there were something like 50,000 pig producers in this country. It is down to 5,000 today, and we lost another seven per cent just in April thanks to the sorts of policies the government engages in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness, the producers are struggling in part with things like a massive 30 to 40 per cent increase in the cost of feed, largely as a result of drought. But you have to couple with that the thing that has made it impossible for the sector to cope with those problems&mdash;the domestic costs foisted on the industry by a government that has no understanding of the need for competitiveness and no will, if you like, for fatigue reform. I do not know how the government ever got fatigue because this industry was never really engaged in reform in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come to some of the specifics and deal with labelling, which was raised during question time. This country's labelling laws are, in our view, totally inadequate&mdash;certainly the pig producers would agree with us. When it comes to ensuring that Australian consumers are able to differentiate between Australian pig meat and products, and their imported substitutes, they have not got a hope. It is little wonder that, when the serious hardship being experienced by the pig industry and those directly dependent upon it for a living has manifested itself, those industry people are in Canberra protesting today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a vital industry to Australia, and it clearly has been let down in several regards. I want to touch on the safeguarding of the industry's interests under international trade law, elaborate on labelling laws and concentrate on the abysmal failure of the government to put in train industrial relations, tax, transport and waterfront reforms. These sorts of things are absolutely critical to the future of the industry specifically and the country in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has received accolades for its steadfast advocacy for the inclusion of agriculture in the GATT process and in particular for its pushing of the Uruguay Round. The result so far has been good, and we have been prepared to support it. But here we face some evidence that the government did not do its homework quite as well as it might have. We have some domestic industries in this country&mdash;citrus is one that comes to mind, and the pig industry is another&mdash;that have been hit hard as a result of an unbalanced, if you like, approach and a move towards free trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of the pig industry are today drawing attention to the increasing volumes of pig meat being imported into Australia from Canada. It is not the first time that this issue has come up. The volume levels are not particularly high, but they often relate to narrow descriptions of pig meats which can have a quite devastating impact in terms of capping market prices, and that is where the real problem comes from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has spent quite a bit of time and a lot of money arguing unsuccessfully before the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority that some sort of punitive tariff should be imposed on the Canadian product. The industry was able to establish that very substantial import assistance was made available to Canadian producers which would normally satisfy the requirements, I would have thought, of most countries that a product was being dumped, but it could not adequately satisfy Australia's rather peculiar attitudes towards material damage. As a result, it was unable to secure a satisfactory outcome. The industry is now considering another venture down that path, weighing up the merits of asking the government to impose an emergency tariff on pig meat imports due to their impact on the domestic industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there appears to be little scope for intervention under the international trade rules agreed to by the government and now administered by the World Trade Organisation. I say in good faith that it seems incredible to me that during the seven-year course of the GATT Uruguay Round the government did not either independently or through the Cairns Group raise the issue of safeguards for Australian primary industries in relation to our problem of severe drought occasionally doing immense damage&mdash;short-term damage which can, if not carefully handled, transpire into long-term damage&mdash;to an industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very concerning that the GATT rules seem to contain no provision for countries like Australia which are subject to regular and severe natural disaster, such as the current drought, to take action in short-term emergencies. I ask: how is it that this government did not seek a safeguard clause that would enable it to take action against imports, in this case of pig meat, which are compounding the very serious impact of a disastrous drought? I ask in good faith: if necessary, will the government revisit this matter and have a very close look at it? I put that to the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), who is sitting opposite, and hope that he will respond. I hope that he will also indicate that the government will do what it can by way of assistance to the industry when it seeks the right to gain access to its own resources to mount any action that it may consider necessary in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of labelling. It is not that our concerns are felt by just the pig industry; they are felt by all peak farmer organisations, consumer groups, trade unions and many food processors. The government's handling of this very important issue is nothing short of an absolute disgrace. Last year it introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill, which would have allowed goods which contained imported ingredients or components to be labelled `Made in Australia'. Such an outcome was clearly untenable to the Australian community, which has an expectation that the term `Made in Australia' will mean exactly what it says or implies: the product is made in this country from components made or grown on our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the interesting rub for the government&mdash;we ask the minister to respond to this in due course&mdash;in the form of what ACTU President Martin Ferguson had to say when he neatly summarised for once public sentiment on an issue in this case. He said that the government's legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . failed to recognise the widely held public perception that goods marked "Made in Australia" denotes that Australia was the place of origin of each major component of the product.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it&mdash;your own travelling companions, the ACTU, condemning your approach, urging you to go down our road. But what do you do? It is the same old story: the government fiddles while Rome burns. In this case the pig industry is being sacrificed in the interests of your slovenly approach to reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Australian community expects not to be deceived about the origin of a product. Members of the community have a right to know whether a product is imported so that they can make an informed choice about buying Australian. I again emphasise that farmers, consumer groups, many food processors and the Australian trade union movement are supportive of a set of reforms in this area which will help the pork industry in its current very difficult circumstances. I ask those opposite: how about some action on this issue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us come to another area&mdash;the question of domestic costs. Report after report in this country has clearly indicated that domestic costs as they affect our agricultural industries, the value adding industries that have built on them and the export industries we are dependent upon if we are to ever drag ourselves out of our economic mess are in desperate need of major reform in areas such as transport, tax and particularly industrial relations. But what happens? Report after report is ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One report we have received in this area, for example, came from the Meat Industry Research Council. What did it find? It found that meat processing costs in Australia are up to three times more than they are in America and twice those of New Zealand. That is why, in essence&mdash;and I see the minister looking over to see how he is going to answer this one; he has ducked it so far&mdash;</PARA>

The report was presented in the second chamber after 14 months, in which the minister had time to get ready and do something for the meat processing industry, on a day when the minister himself was in America. The point I am making is not that he should not have been in America but that this important matter was covered while the minister was not even in the country. Then when it got to the Senate it was handled by a parliamentary secretary, not the minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), for his contribution. Once more&mdash;like all the things we get from those in the National Party&mdash;it is a little bit of populism. They were expecting to have a big audience but, unfortunately, the audience has gone to meet the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). In response to what the Deputy Leader of the National Party has said, there are a number of points I would like to make to put this debate back into perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the primary cause of the current difficulties is high feed prices, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party alluded to, due to drought. But this situation is showing signs of improving as new season crops become available, with imported grain and livestock feed also easing the pressure on prices in some cases. In the interim, there are established government funded programs in place including, for example, assistance under the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling service to assist those producers who are in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard suggestions that some elements of GATT could potentially provide an option for assistance to the industry. But the use of these clauses would need to be consistent with our commitment under the Uruguay Round negotiations or our commitment to achieving a freer world trade environment. The pig industry would need to make a strong case for these options to be more closely considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although little appears to have changed since the industry's anti-dumping and countervailing actions undertaken in 1992, the industry is entitled to exercise these rights under the GATT arrangements if it feels it has a substantial case. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is meeting with pig producers right this minute, and I believe he informed the Senate earlier today that this is one of the issues he will be discussing with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises the current difficult circumstances being faced by the pig industry and other intensive livestock industries. There are several issues that are of concern to them&mdash;the effects of the drought, the high grain prices, the Canadian pig meat imports and, as referred to in the debate, food labelling issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is experiencing a severe cost price squeeze, which is primarily due to high feed prices resulting from the drought. Both large and small producers are reportedly suffering large losses, as feed accounts for some 70 per cent of production costs. The price of feed barley has roughly doubled over the past year, while saleyard prices have remained fairly constant. Feed prices are beginning to show signs of improving as the new season crop becomes available and imported grains and livestock feed also enter the market. I believe that these imports are being opposed by a number of groups supporting this rally today, such as the New South Wales Farmers Federation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And obviously the member opposite. While the current costs for feed are high, the outlook now is much better. My latest advice from ABARE is that feed prices for 1995-96 will be back to or below the 1993-94 pre-drought prices. These difficult circumstances have intensified the adjustment pressures on the industry and the existing assistance through the rural adjustment scheme is providing help already to the industry. My advice is that 110 specialist pig producers are receiving $2.2 million in normal RAS support.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw without qualification. Prices would also normally be expected to rise towards Christmas due to the ham trade. My advice also is that imports from Canada for 1994-95 will be about 4,000 tonnes compared to domestic production of 335,000 tonnes, that is, 2.4 per cent of the total market. This is about the same level of imports as 1991-92. Canadian imports are in the form of boned out, frozen product which, under the protocol, has to be cooked on arrival and is then processed into products such as pressed hams. The industry maintains that, although the imports represent less than five per cent of total production, they have a price overhang effect on the local market, effectively putting a ceiling on the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, when the industry was facing a similar situation of low profitability due to high feed prices and also a high level of Canadian imports, the industry initiated an anti-dumping countervailing duty action. The outcome, including a Federal Court appeal, was that Canadian imports have not caused and did not threaten material injury to the Australian industry. This case was lost, and the industry claim that a 25c a kilo subsidy was being applied by the Canadians was not upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appear to be some very conflicting claims made, and I welcome the opportunity for the matter to be resolved. If the industry believes there is evidence of dumping by the Canadian industry this should be taken to the Anti-Dumping Authority, which must assess such claims before Australia can take countervailing action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. Go back to 1992. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy approached the relevant minister earlier today to discuss the possibility of the Industry Commission undertaking an industry development reference to examine constraints on the efficiency and competitiveness of the industry. He has advised me that he has discussed the possibility of the commission examining the evidence and effectiveness of subsidies of pig meat sold in Australia in the likelihood that such subsidies are causing material injury. As I have said before, I believe we will canvass this course of action with the delegation of pig producers who will meet today with the minister for primary industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for country-of-origin labelling lies with the National Food Authority. Again, this is one of the issues that was raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) through the Food Standards Code and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs through the trade practices legislation. These matters are being addressed through the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994. There has been considerable public debate about the provisions of the bill. As a result, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) and her parliamentary secretary agreed in March this year to refer the issue to the National Food Authority. The NFA has activated a public review of the country-of-origin labelling provisions of the Food Standards Code. I am advised that the Minister for Consumer Affairs has said publicly that the provisions of the bill are aimed at providing a viable and simple labelling system for consumers to identify Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before entering this debate I had discussions with the parliamentary secretary, who advised me that pork producers have made a submission to the public review and the review will conclude in September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at some of the more general issues and claims made in this debate. Although total imports of pig meat represent around 2 1/2 per cent of Australian pig production, I see that the industry makes a number of claims: that imports have a price overhang effect on the local market, effectively putting a ceiling on prices; that Canadian imports are subsidised at a rate of 25c a kilo; and that imports represent up to 20 per cent of certain market product sectors. Recent work by ABARE on monthly data for the period August 1990 to February 1995 has found that there is no significant relationship between either the volume or the unit value of Canadian imports and Australian pig saleyard prices. This work supports the outcome of the 1992 anti-dumping inquiry, which failed to prove that imports caused material injury to the Australian industry then or are likely to in the future. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Truss" NAMEID="GT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr Truss</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's the trouble with your definitions.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It's not the trouble. I was actually the minister at the time and I know this case very well. Although the PCA has been quoted in the press as saying that Canadian subsidies are 25c a kilo Australian on Canadian pork produced, the 1990 report of the Australian Customs Service, which was presented to me as the then minister, on frozen pork from Canada calculated subsidies on feed grain and pig production as 11c a kilo Canadian on Canadian pork produced and only a small proportion, if any, is reflected in the price of pork exported to Australia. I understand that this view is supported by the Industry Commission and ABARE. I also believe that it occurred at a time when the Canadian dollar nearly matched the Australian dollar. The 25c a kilo was the figure that the PCA originally put to the inquiry and that was disproved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that recent advice indicates that the Canadians have been winding back their level of support since the 1992 anti-dumping case in Australia. For instance, the grain transportation subsidy is to be eliminated with effect from 1 August this year. The cost price squeeze being experienced by the industry is primarily due to high feed prices resulting from the drought. Feed purchases represent a very high proportion of the cost of pig production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that feed prices are beginning to show signs of improving, as the new season crop becomes available and imported grains and livestock feed also enter the market. ABARE work has calculated that for commodity delivered to Sydney the following applies: feed barley pre-drought 1993-94 was $119 per tonne, the drought peak was $230 per tonne and it is predicted by ABARE's forecast to be in 1995-96 $155 per tonne. Sorghum pre-drought was $184, peaking at $250 and coming back in 1995-96 to $143. Feed wheat was at $160 pre-drought, peaked at $260 in November 1994 and is predicted in 1995-96 to be $180 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure members are also aware of changes in the industry over recent years. Again, these were alluded to by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. As peak production has increased, the number of producers has been declining, from 40,000 to fewer than 5,000 producers in 25 years. Twenty per cent of farms are now responsible for 70 per cent of the total pig herd and improvements in efficiency of production are being reflected in greater numbers and heavier pigs being slaughtered. Difficulties faced by the remaining 70 per cent of farms&mdash;those with less than 50 sows&mdash;collectively account for only 15 per cent of pig meat produced. It is these producers who will continue to face adjustment pressures. Indeed, many of these producers are on wheat-sheep properties and move in and out of pig meat on an opportunistic basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in the pig industry is not unique. Similar difficulties are being faced by other intensive livestock industries: eggs, chickens, feedlots, et cetera. For example, the egg industry has experienced not only high feed prices but also a massive adjustment due to the deregulation of the industry. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bloke has never learnt anything in his life. It appears that the industry can be broadly divided into three categories of producers: large operators who will cope with current downturns; operators who, while having a profitable long-term future in the industry, are currently experiencing financial hardship; and, finally, those operators who, as part of the continuing major restructuring, are not viable in the long term and will leave the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-term profitable operators who choose to diversify out of pig meat production, or to upgrade their operations, may be eligible for support under the production enhancement provisions of normal RAS, while any who choose to leave the industry may be eligible for re-establishment support. Those whose operations are located in drought exceptional circumstances areas may be eligible for drought exceptional circumstances support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is prepared to approach the state RAS authorities to ensure that they assess applications for support by pig producers in a sensitive manner. This in no way can be taken to indicate a position to bend the rules to give pork producers more favourable treatment under RAS than applies to other people in the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of industry restructuring in the longer term, I would also repeat what has been stated on earlier occasions. That is, it is vital that the industry continues to move towards being internationally competitive and producing a high quality, safe product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what they say on the other side of the House, the government is not blind to these issues. Initiatives commenced last year to facilitate the import of feed grain, subject to necessary quarantine considerations, to show the government's awareness of the problems facing this industry. Unlike some of the people who have interjected, on many occasions I have met with pork producers from my electorate, and I know that these are problems they have been facing for many years. As I said before, it is the smaller pork producer who faces the more competitive pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought exceptional circumstances assistance under the rural adjustment scheme is targeted support aimed directly at all eligible farm business enterprises and those more severely affected by exceptional drought conditions. It is determined on the basis of the six core criteria agreed by all governments&mdash;and they reflect the impact rare and severe rainfall deficiencies have had on farm conditions and farm incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In drought exceptional circumstances areas, assistance is extended to intensive livestock producers such as piggeries. Many producers have already received assistance. Outside drought exceptional circumstances areas, the access of intensive industries to normal RAS support is assessed in the same way as it is for other farmers. The pig sector is an important part of our rural industry but, in general, the rural sector has recorded sustained growth in production and exports over the last 30 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to participate in this matter of public importance. I must say the contribution just given by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) was at best disappointing. I thought that, even by his standards, it showed some lack of sympathy and understanding of the plight currently facing Australia's pig producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Resources&mdash;echoing the sentiments of, and reading a speech doubtless given to him by, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins)&mdash;has suggested that much of the problem currently facing Australia's pig producers is the rising grain prices. I would not dispute that, but surely the solution is not to simply have depressed grain prices so that all other Australian primary producers also find themselves once again with their backs to the wall&mdash;nor is it a solution to suggest that we can pour $2.2 million of rural adjustment money into the Australian pork industry, as outlined by the minister. It is no solution at all. They are the people who are already about to leave the industry or are in dire straits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wants to take all of those people who have the potential to be viable Australian pork producers and help them to participate in a lively and active export market. We do not do that by telling them that Christmas hams are bound to be a solution to their problem, as the minister has suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a group of people outside this House, whether they are foresters or Australian pork producers, who are prepared to make the journey to Canberra, prepared effectively to bus it to Canberra, prepared to go through all the discomfort of hours in a bus when their bank accounts are already depressed, and prepared to make those arrangements at their expense, we must know that something is wrong. When we have an industry that is faced with a fall in production from 40,000 producers to 5,000 producers, as the minister alleged, we have an industry that has clearly already gone through a great deal of restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here today we as a parliament are faced with an industry that is effectively caught in a pincer movement. The pincer is between the import of Canadian product, which is subsidised, and the rising cost of Australian grain. We in the opposition have chosen this as a matter of public importance not simply to sheet the blame home to the government but in an effort to find some answers and solutions for the Australian pork industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be particularly easy for those of us in opposition to simply blame the government. If that was what we wanted to do, we would have walked away from the arrangements debated in this House under the World Trade Organisation bill, walked away from our obligations under GATT, and said, `That's the government's doing.' We have not done that. We have said that there is never any such thing as a level playing field but that there are more advantages than disadvantages under the negotiated GATT arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view the world trade arrangements are like playing a dirty craps game, such as I suspect world trade has always been. But, in this case, we go on playing recognising that all of our opponents have stacked decks. The obligation we now face under GATT, and the reason we welcome GATT, is, instead of our opponents playing with those card decks under the table, they are now obliged to keep their hands above the table. The game is still loaded to our disadvantage but at least we have a chance to see what sorts of tactics they are up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that the Canadians have clearly enjoyed real subsidies that have made it possible for their producers to land product in Australia cheaper than we can produce it. As a result, the Australian industry has suffered material injury. It is quite right to say, and we concede the fact, that 2.7 per cent of the Australian pork production is imported from Canada. That does not mean there is no material injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the pork producers revealed to the coalition's primary industry committee earlier today, we have a situation where some pork cooperatives quite responsibly refuse to have any imported product at all while others do not mind how much they have. So some retailers are effectively peddling products that contain 25 per cent Canadian pork while others are peddling none at all. The impact is much more dramatic than the 2.7 per cent would indicate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not pretend that it is easy to solve this problem under GATT, though personally we think the government was a little too anxious to negotiate a little too much away in the original GATT provisions. But the government must know that one great tariff barrier is still permitted under the GATT arrangements. That tariff barrier is called consumer preference. For so long as Australian consumers make a free choice for one product or the other, it has no GATT legal or illegal implications at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian consumers seek the chance to discern one product from the other, and they are being denied that chance. Why? Because the government's labelling laws are not available and are not in place. What happened to the origin labelling bill that could have done much to solve the problem that the pork producers face? What happened to the bill that could have meant Australian consumers had a real choice? It all got a bit hard, didn't it? We might offend some of our friends, so it has been passed off to the National Food Authority for another review and, so the parliamentary secretary tells me, for a public workshop that is to be held during the parliamentary recess. He hopes that the standards might be finalised by August or September 1995. </PARA>

As the price of ham rises for Christmas, those left in the Australian pork industry will hope that they will have an opportunity to participate in a marginally better situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and restate the argument that the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) put. He made it quite clear that one of the major disadvantages that Australian pork producers face is the growing cost of production in Australia. Downstream processing is much dearer for Australian producers than it is for our neighbours. We only need to look at the cost of our abattoirs compared with the cost of New Zealand abattoirs, which is only across the Tasman. We would be prepared to mirror their actions except this government refuses to implement the recommendations given to it by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A viable Australian is being disadvantaged because the government, firstly, refuses to put in place the domestic labelling legislation which the industry needs and, secondly, refuses to introduce the domestic reforms in the labour market that are so desperately needed. Pork producers will face, from this weekend, a rise in their costs of production simply because the government in its budget said that all sales tax will be cranked up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pig industry is vital to Australia. It is not one of the big earners in export terms and it does not have a big share of the domestic meat market. However, regardless of the fact that it is a small industry, it is still one of the many  industries that makes up the Australian economy. It adds to the diversity and strength of the Australian economy which is achieved when you have a range of industries producing food. This industry contributes substantially to the economy in terms of value adding and, as a result, is also a major employer within the Australian economy. It plays a small role in the export market, but that is not the point that we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Earlier this afternoon I, along with my colleague the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who is the chair of the caucus primary industries and energy committee, met with a delegation of pork producers and processors who are in Canberra today to bring their protest to the parliament. It was unfortunate that, because the meeting was scheduled outside the normal time for our meeting and due to short notice, a number of my colleagues could not be at that meeting. Nevertheless, I think the meeting between the delegation and the members of parliament who were there was constructive. Some very interesting points were raised and I am sure that they will be followed through by the caucus committee at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the issues highlighted in the meeting and rally today are very unfortunate, but I think it has been recognised by those opposite who have spoken on this issue that some of the issues are beyond the control of any government. I specifically refer to the drought and the world trade and GATT rules that we work under. The member for Wakefield did not back off from acknowledging that those rules present some difficulties. He acknowledged their role and rightful place in the Australian economy. I thank him for that bit of honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to find that it took the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) some six minutes to mention pig producers. He spent four minutes talking about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It was very good of him to use some colourful jokes and story lines, but they did not contribute to the debate. He also ran out a few cliches. He gave some interesting figures in his historical analysis from 1950. He stated that there were some 60,000 pig producers in 1950&mdash;you will have to excuse me if I get the figures wrong; I am going from memory&mdash;and that there are 5,000 producers today. That is a big fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what point he was trying to make. I have a fairly famous pig producer living in my electorate&mdash;a former leader of the National Party. He is still a pig producer as far as I know. I also have six to 10 other pig producers in my electorate. It is a very small industry, but they are still contributing to the local economy by employing people. This is a vital value adding industry, as we all recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the member for Gwydir was trying to indicate by the use of the figures relating to the drop in pig producers from 60,000 to 5,000 that the policies of this government are going to result in further falls in the number of pig producers across Australia. Perhaps he was simply acknowledging that there is a historical trend downwards in the number of pig producers in Australia. If the numbers fall below a certain level, that will be regrettable because it will be difficult to keep the industry viable and competitive. I am sure that both sides of the House want to see the industry remain viable. </PARA>

If the member for Gwydir wants a reason why the number of producers fell from 60,000 to 5,000, mostly during the term of the coalition government, he only has to look at some of the famous words that Mr Doug Anthony used. When backing up the primary industry, he told dairy farmers on the north coast to get big or get out. That is the nature of the support that producers in my area got from the National Party. If the member for Gwydir is looking for reasons for that fall then he should look at the lack of support in terms of policies that the coalition has offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also made some comments about the role of the rural adjustment scheme. It was decried a bit by the member for Wakefield. Those opposite have to acknowledge that RAS does have a role to play in the economy, even though they made some negative comments about it today. It makes a substantial contribution to looking after farmers across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue&mdash;I acknowledge that the member for Wakefield spent some time on this&mdash;relates to the nature of the labelling. I am quite happy to run through the issues that were raised in our meeting with the pork producers and processors this afternoon. We discussed the labelling, the imports and obviously the nature of the drought. The drought has contributed to the industry's problems. Obviously, due to the lack of feed, the prices have gone up. The Minister for Resources addressed that issue for quite some time in his speech on the matter of public importance. He also mentioned the fact that feed costs have risen and will hopefully fall again now that the climate is more favourable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister raised some of the difficulties that value adding industries such as the pig industry are having with imports. He also commented on the fact that the Pork Council of Australia has contributed to the development of the AQIS grain imports manual, which would see grains able to be imported and meet some of the cost that the industry is faced with. Feed costs contribute to some 60 per cent or more of the cost of producing a kilogram of pork, and that is substantial. Obviously, those feed costs, which are contributing so much to the price rise, have a substantial impact on the viability of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be an appropriate time to mention the nature of the countervailing action of the industry against the imports of meat. The member for Wakefield referred to the subsidising of pork in Canada prior to its export to Australia. If he were to have added a little more, his comments might have been a bit more constructive. At the meeting at lunchtime today, the delegation said that it felt that, with respect to the countervailing action in Canada, the feed costs and the subsidies of those feed costs were not accepted by the Anti-Dumping Authority, and that is to be regretted. If what was said is correct, I think it is a real mistake and a genuine abrogation of the Anti-Dumping Authority's responsibilities not to count the obvious flow-on effect of having a subsidy, if you like, of the feed costs in the Canadian industry which would enable it to export meat to Australia at a cost which is more competitive with that in the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of comment both within the House and outside the House on the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill which was passed through this House six or more months ago and which was held up in the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 16th and 17th reports of the committee for 1995 relating to the Golf Course Estate development, Palmerston, Northern Territory, and the joint venture development with Delfin Property Group of the Willows, Townsville, for defence housing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The 16th and 17th reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works for 1995 relate to joint venture housing developments to be undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority in partnership with the Delfin Property Group in Darwin and Townsville. While recommending that both projects should proceed, the committee has made a number of comments on each of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Darwin project, which is the subject of the committee's 16th report for 1995, relates to the development of the Golf Course Estate at Palmerston, Northern Territory. The government decision to increase the army presence in the north involved a need to expand infrastructure works at Robertson Barracks and to provide additional housing in the Darwin area to accommodate army personnel and their families. The site to the north of University Avenue will be known as Fairway Waters in the suburb of Durack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority proposes to develop a 132.9 hectare site in a joint venture project which will integrate service and private sector housing and which will yield some 1,400 units, of which approximately one-third will be retained for service families. The site is well located for army personnel working at Robertson Barracks and is in close proximity to the educational, community, recreational and commercial facilities of Palmerston. As part of the negotiations for this site, the Defence Housing Authority has undertaken to extend the existing golf course at Palmerston to an 18-hole course at a cost of $4.7 million. Half of this cost will be borne by the joint venture partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a time the committee has been concerned that some Defence Housing Authority housing is being built too close together, with resultant lack of privacy for the occupants. The committee therefore recommends that the Defence Housing Authority considers increasing the size of its housing blocks so that more privacy is afforded to occupants of its houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the public hearing, the Defence Housing Authority was not able to provide the committee with definite plans of the types of houses it intends to construct. The committee recommends that, once housing plans are finalised and before construction commences, the Defence Housing Authority should formally brief the committee on the types and costs of houses it intends to construct and the size of the blocks intended for the Golf Course Estate. The committee also recommends that the Defence Housing Authority includes in its contract documents a clause stating that subcontractors must be paid before progress payments are made to contractors. This will eventually be known as the Braithwaite-Humphreys document because of the work of both those members in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised at the public hearing that a site on Marjorie Street, approximately one kilometre to the north of the proposed estate, was used for many years as a Commonwealth and later private analytical laboratory. That site has elevated levels of lead, zinc, arsenic and cadmium. The committee was advised that preliminary investigations of this now vacant land indicate that there is a potential for the elevated levels to have extended along the drainage line onto the proposed site. However, the precise extent is unknown at this stage. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the site does not pose an environmental or health risk. In order to prevent such occurrences in the future, the committee recommends that the Defence Housing Authority should ensure that its sites have been examined and cleared of any possibility of contamination prior to referral of projects to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends the development of the Golf Course Estate at Palmerston, Northern Territory, at an estimated cost of $144.02 million to the Defence Housing Authority, subject to confirmation that the Defence Housing Authority would build on the site only if any contamination has been remediated to the satisfaction of its expert advisers. The recommendation is also subject to the briefing of the committee by the Defence Housing Authority on the types and costs of houses it intends to construct and the size of the blocks intended for the Golf Course Estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have just tabled&mdash;the committee's 17th report for the year&mdash;deals with the development of land at the Willows in Townsville. The DHA identified a need to provide adequate housing for service families in Townsville. Originally, the Defence Housing Authority formed a joint venture with the Delfin Property Group to tender for a parcel of land at Douglas in Townsville. The tender was unsuccessful. Soon after, on behalf of the joint venture, DHA successfully negotiated the acquisition of 107 hectares of land at Kirwan known as the Willows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Development of a portion of the land on the eastern side of the main stormwater drain has already taken place. The proposal examined by the committee involves the development of the balance of the land. It is planned that the Defence Housing Authority acquire approximately 25 per cent of the lots from the joint venture at a reasonable discount and construct new houses for service families, specifically designed for the local climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority owns 833 houses in Townsville which are classified as being substandard and of these 309 will be disposed of and the balance will be upgraded over the next three years. The committee concluded that there is a need to provide additional houses in Townsville as a consequence of existing substandard housing, the Defence Housing Authority disposal program and planned relocations of Defence personnel to Townsville from southern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site which the joint venture will develop is 107 hectares, which will yield 1,000 blocks of which no more than 20 per cent will be courtyard lots. The Defence Housing Authority and Delfin will share the development costs and any profits equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority will acquire a minimum of 200 blocks during the life of the development, with the balance being offered for private sale. Traditional suburban blocks will be 650 square metres and courtyard lots 450 square metres. As was the case with the Palmerston report, the committee has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority should consider increasing the size of its housing blocks so that more privacy is afforded to occupants and advise the committee of the size of the blocks intended for the Willows development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that before any siteworks commence a comprehensive resource inventory should be undertaken, including vegetation, soils and the presence and location of any cultural sites of significance. Measures designed to protect endangered or rare species and cultural sites found on the site should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made a number of recommendations concerning the design of the houses. The first is that the Defence Housing Authority, having gone to the expense of commissioning a portfolio of tropical housing designs, should retain ownership of any plans commissioned from local architects and engage tropical design experts from James Cook University to review any designs before they are accepted. When these plans are finalised and before construction commences at the Willows, the committee has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority should formally brief the committee on the types and cost of houses it intends to construct and the sizes of the blocks to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter relating to the design of houses involves the provision of solar hot-water heaters. The Defence Housing Authority advised the committee that it is not proposed to provide the houses with solar hot-water heaters on the grounds that it is not the community standard in Townsville. The committee believes that the stance taken by the Defence Housing Authority is at variance with the government's policy to nationally reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the reasons for not installing them in Townsville are out of touch with national interest considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current estimates suggest there are 250,000 solar hot-water heaters already installed in Australia. The committee believes it is difficult to determine what community standards are with so many installed and strong growth expected as a consequence of Commonwealth initiatives such as the energy card. Community standards are dynamic and the committee believes the stance taken by the Defence Housing Authority should not be reactive. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that Defence Housing Authority houses in the Willows estate should be provided with solar hot-water heaters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When referred to the committee the estimated cost of the proposed joint venture development was $37 million, while land acquisition cost was $5.6 million&mdash;a total of $42.6 million. Being a joint venture, the Defence Housing Authority is responsible for 50 per cent of the broadacre development costs&mdash;a total of $21.3 million. The cost of the acquisition of allotments and the construction of 200 houses amounts to $38.517 million, giving a total cost to the Defence Housing Authority of $59.817 million. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will not go over the material that has been covered by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), but I believe that in these two reports the committee was pioneering in an area where DHA was not quite sure of where it was going because it was involved in a joint venture development with private enterprise. DHA was not quite sure of the number of houses and blocks that would be required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been operating on an important learning curve. That is evidenced by the fact that the amount that was going to be spent in the brief that was given to us was not the amount we have recommended. I believe the DHA will know precisely what will be required in the future. I also suggest that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), who is in charge of this portfolio, make very careful examination of the project because it could quite well be that the committee will be forced in the future to make recommendations similar to this that are at variance with the actual brief. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to commend the secretariat on what I believe are two very finely written reports. They are very critical in some areas. Although we have recommended the use of solar hot water on so many occasions and we have been promised by DHA that it would examine the economic benefits after considering the initial capital cost, DHA seems to be most reluctant to move. Paragraph 69 of the Willows report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DHA has been most reluctant to accept the Committee's recommendations that its houses should be provided with solar hot water heaters . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 72 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes the stance taken by the DHA Board is at variance with the Government's policy to nationally reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 75 I think we went further and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community standards are dynamic and the Committee believes DHA should not be reactive. Clearly there is a need for the DHA stance to be more in keeping with its stated mission . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is very important. I would hope DHA will take that aspect of solar application into account, particularly in northern Australia where we have an unlimited amount of sun to generate solar power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern that became obvious in the report was the design of houses. We are dealing with Palmerston in Darwin and Townsville, which are in the tropics. As a Queenslander and as a North Queenslander&mdash;somebody who lives in the tropics&mdash;it distresses me that the DHA seems to be prone to adopting designs for houses that are fitted for the Sydney-Melbourne environment. It is fair enough to say that the people who are coming to these establishments within the defence services are people who would be used to a certain style of housing&mdash;low set, brick&mdash;but it is very important to recognise that in the north you can generate a better living atmosphere, without the necessity of air conditioning, by the manner in which you build the houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very important recommendations is that we believe DHA should put this matter to rest once and for all. It should utilise the services of someone within the James Cook University who knows about tropical designs, and allocate some money to see whether they can get down to a basic living design that is fit for the tropics so people can be comfortable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that distresses me&mdash;and this is one of the reasons the committee has made this recommendation&mdash;is that when the number and the size of the blocks are known the DHA should come and formally brief the committee on what its requirements are at that stage, because it is still in the very iffy department. The chairman of the DHA board, Mr Graham, came to the first meeting and said, `We don't know when to put a proposition to you. Is it when it is in the final form, when we know the number of blocks we require, when we know the price of the houses?' Obviously when DHA set a starting point it brought it to us. In that respect, we are not definite on the final results. I think it is appropriate that those designs come back to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does distress me is that the two comparable projects are both joint ventures where DHA is taking blocks and building on them, but the price of building in Darwin, estimated at $225,000, is 50 per cent higher than the cost of building a comparable sort of building in Townsville. I know that Townsville is a nice place to live and everything else, but I cannot imagine that that type of variation is there. There are some additions in the houses at Darwin, such as airconditioning, which the houses in Townsville do not have&mdash;although I think they should. There is that slight variation. I believe it is important that when we examine, as a committee, the final prices of houses in both Darwin and Townsville a satisfactory answer be given as to why this huge variance is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found working with DHA a delight. They do not hold anything back; they were excellent witnesses. I believe there has been a learning curve. It has been a pioneering experience. Subject to those other safeguards, I think we can see the matter through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other aspect of Townsville that we thought might have been of interest to the authorities up there is community facilities, referred to at paragraph 59. We found, as is the case in many of the provincial towns outside the capital cities, that public transport leaves a lot to be desired. I believe that if we are to service the Willows establishment in Townsville it has to be demonstrated that there is an adequate transport system to take people from where they live into town and around about. It is a problem not unique to Townsville. It is a problem right through those places outside capital cities. Capital cities seem to be able to get taxpayer funded rebates to run their transport, whereas in provincial cities you are left to your own devices. I support the two reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is not often that one gets an opportunity in this House to speak on matters relating to the Defence Housing Authority or, indeed, on major developments in one's own electorate. The report today presented by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), presents such an occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority was established by the Commonwealth government as a statutory authority to operate from 1 January 1988. I agree with the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) that it has been an outstanding success, unquestionably. Its chief mission statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide Defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards and which will contribute positively to their quality of life. In achieving this mission the Authority shall meet Defence operational needs, follow sound commercial principles and be a responsive and innovative organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>By and large, those objectives have been admirably achieved by the Defence Housing Authority. I turn now to the joint venture development with Delfin Property Group at the Willows at Kirwan, Townsville. Housing requirements in Townsville for Defence Force personnel are expected to increase from 1,724 dwellings in 1996-97 to 2,151 dwellings in 1998-99. In addition, another 309 houses are required to replace substandard stock. A good proportion of the Defence Housing Authority's new housing requirement will be met through the Willows joint venture between the Defence Housing Authority and the Delfin Property Group, which is recognised as a leader in large and innovative quality urban community development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Willows site covers an area of approximately 107 hectares. The authority will build 200 houses for Defence Force families, and the Delfin Property Group will develop about 600 blocks for sale to the public. The choice of allotments and choice of quality housing will be achieved through a detailed building covenant system to be actively administered by the developers. There will be a requirement that all homes be built within a reasonable time so that residents are not living next to a bare allotment for too long. The estate will be well landscaped. A tree retention policy will require that selected existing trees not be removed, but there will be a very strong program of planting trees and shrubbery in this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three- and four-bedroom homes provided by the authority will be built for maximum cross-flow ventilation and coolness. The authority, I am informed, has had extensive consultations with defence spouse groups and local service housing authorities. They have all agreed that the development is well located for service families and is very handy to Lavarack Barracks and the RAAF base at Townsville. The spouse group and the service housing authorities will continue to be consulted in respect of the development. That consultation process is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the sentiments expressed by the member for Dawson. It is astonishing that in 1995 any authority could suggest that solar hot water systems should not be installed in government dwellings north of the tropic of Capricorn. I commend the committee for its recommendations in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally support the comments of the member for Dawson in respect of the design of houses and support his suggestion. I have had representations made to me on this issue by architects who are experts in tropical design. They have condemned as inadequate the design parameters being adopted by certain government instrumentalities&mdash;houses designed for a temperate environment rather than a tropical environment. These houses become hotboxes and very unsuitable for comfortable living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point the member for Dawson made related to the small size of some of the allotments. There has been an increasing trend in residential development over the last 15 years for residential allotments to become smaller. I do not know why that is so. I do not know whether there has been some commercial demand for that which has driven people to accept that as their lot in life, but traditionally in tropical areas the size of an allotment was at least 800 square metres. This was regarded as the minimum size for a satisfactory living environment. I notice that there is a trend within the Defence Housing Authority on these new estates for the allotments to be rather small. They do add to the challenge faced by defence families in relation to the proximity of neighbours to gain as much privacy as would reasonably be expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate development will comprise a neighbourhood of 3,300 people. It will be a mixed development, as I have said previously, of defence housing and private dwellings. That has been a feature adopted by the authority since its institution. Instead of establishing ghettos, the authority mixes the development with the civilian community. That policy has been an outstanding success. The development is adjacent to the Willows Golf Course. This presents an opportunity for the authority to build upon the green image of the Willows Golf Course by ensuring that barbecue and picnic areas and other features of the development are consistent with the overall appearance of the adjacent developments, including the Willows Golf Course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, this is a very commendable development that is recommended in the report. Subject to the caveats, or indeed suggestions, that have been made by previous speakers, including the member for Dawson, I commend the project to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)recognises the work of the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee in establishing a comprehensive plan to develop 1000 new jobs on Australia's Holiday Coast; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)recognises the jobs program, the biggest in any region in Australia, is a part of the New Work Opportunities Program and has the full support of the business and community organisations throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has certainly made an interesting move in bringing this private member's motion on today, which is not private members business day, and on the back of an interesting little exchange which was had during question time between the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and one of his backbenchers who asked him a dorothy dixer. Obviously, the government's move in bringing this motion on is politically motivated in that it is an attempt to distort my support for a local project into being full support for the government's new work opportunities program. So, at the outset, it should be noted that this motion is not a ringing endorsement of this particular government program but a recognition of local people being innovative and entrepreneurial in an attempt to strengthen a major local industry and, at the same time, to give some hope that the private sector will provide long-term positions for the 1,000 long-term unemployed involved in this program who, we must all remember, are at the centre of the Australia holiday coast project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion relates to the remarkable achievement of an outstanding group of people in my area who have managed to put in place a program to provide jobs for unemployed people. Despite a continued lack of professionalism from the DEET bureaucracy, these people have managed to use in a responsible way funds from one of the government's labour market programs called new work opportunities. The jobs program, which this group of regional leaders has put in place, has the unqualified endorsement of business and community groups throughout the region, as the motion says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the local committee has recognised that DEET program dollars alone will not solve the structural nature of unemployment in the region. What is required is some stimulus to grow the current industry base. The committee believes that this is required by all identified industry sectors. However, it feels that the tourism sector already has significant underutilised infrastructure in place and that, by stimulating the tourism industry, there is the possibility of creating these jobs and that there may be a flow-on to other sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local committee of which this motion is about is concerned with recognising the work of a group of local people who are deeply concerned about the 17 per cent level of unemployment, which is twice the national average, currently running in my area of the mid-north coast of New South Wales. The committee is chaired by Mr John Ross, who is the proprietor of McDonald's Family Restaurants in Taree and Port Macquarie which are right at the centre of the mid-north coast. John has been heavily involved in tourism promotion in the region for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also on the committee are representatives of the Southern Cross University; the North Coast Institute of TAFE; the executive officer of MIDROC, which is the regional organisation of councils in the area; and representatives of the union movement and the Council of Social Services. Also on the committee is a high profile local supporter of regional development, Councillor Les Brown of the Greater Taree City Council. He is also the chairperson of the Mid-North Coast Regional Development Board, the chairperson of MIDREDO, the chairperson of the local OLMA committee, and a councillor on Northpower. Also on the committee is the regional manager of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business community is represented by Craig Bowen, managing director of Nautilus on the Beach at Coffs Harbour; Don Phillips, owner-operator of Office Data Systems in Taree; Janine Reed, owner-operator of the Utungan Nursery; and Denis Hawkins, from the nursing home industry. Representing the Aboriginal local council is Wayne Simes, and advising the committee is Ms Joan Leeds of the Jobs North office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project revolves around the tourism industry&mdash;an industry that has been hamstrung by the policies of this government. As the majority of tourist operations on Australia's holiday coast are small businesses, the tourist industry has been severely hampered by the government's ridiculous industrial relations laws&mdash;in particular, those laws relating to unfair dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken with many tourist business operators on the mid-north coast who have quite clearly stated that, due to the industrial relations laws of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), they have purposely shied away from employing people. It is quite clear that, if this government's industrial relations laws did not exist in Australia today, our unemployment queues would be nowhere near as long and our balance of payments would be nowhere near as severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ever increasing fuel excise has also been a severe impediment to tourist operators on the mid-north coast. As the local market traditionally arrives at and gets around the mid-north coast by motor vehicle, the 35c out of every litre which is swallowed by the Keating government is simply an outrageous impediment on tourism businesses in the region and it significantly bumps up the average price of a family holiday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport into the region has been a major problem for the local tourism industry. Air and road links have their own problems, with limited air access to the southern end of the region. As always, I have to mention the Pacific Highway and the way in which this government&mdash;after having seen a significant need to upgrade the highway and after having seen that significant costs would be involved in this&mdash;has washed its hands of all responsibility to the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had many debates about the Pacific Highway and the need for this parliament to recognise it as the national highway. The government has simply recognised that it is a problem too great for it to handle and, in doing so, it has washed its hands of all responsibility to the people on the mid-north coast. I am sure that the people of the electorates of Page and Richmond, as well as Paterson, are fully aware of these irresponsible and uncaring actions of the government, particularly since it abolished the black spots program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional development strategies of the government are also questionable&mdash;with the result being limited mobile phone access and limited conference planning. In an age when the government is spending its entire time gloating about the information superhighway, here we have a region of Australia&mdash;which is similar to most non-metropolitan regions&mdash;that the government has totally ignored as far as equality of services is concerned. The region has been ignored in a wide range of areas, one of which is telecommunications&mdash;with no access to SBS, limited mobile phone access, limited Optus access and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as this, I could not count the number of times I have been approached by local tourist operators who have said that the fringe benefits tax regime of this government is hard to manage and is a serious impediment on employment in our local region. Recently, a series of tax seminars for small businesses were held in my local region. They were put on by the Newcastle tax office. At every meeting like this, someone from the floor raises the issue of fringe benefits tax as being of deep concern to the livelihoods of local tourist operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the subject of government impedients to the tourist industry, let us not forget the one per cent across-the-board increase which will come into practice this Saturday with the KST&mdash;the Keating sales tax. It was unannounced and comes from the 1993 budget. It has been increasing each year and will increase again on all levels by one per cent this Saturday. As this sales tax continues to spiral upwards and out of control&mdash;with no cuts to personal income tax&mdash;it is business that is suffering. In turn, the country is being dragged backwards in the tourist industry in comparison with our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mid-north coast covers the local government areas of Forster-Tuncurry, Gloucester, Taree, Hastings, Kempsey, Nambucca, Bellingen and Coffs Harbour. The regional population is 239,000, and its unemployment rate is currently running at 17 per cent. As I said before, that unemployment rate is twice the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now 152,517 people employed on a part-time or full-time basis in the tourism industry throughout the region, catering to the 2,018,200 visitors who holiday on Australia's holiday coast every year. It has been identified that the local tourism industry infrastructure can accommodate a 50 per cent increase in visitors. In raw figures, this is an extra 1,009,000 people, bringing an extra $350 million per year to the region. These statistics were identified by the local committee responsible for developing the project that we are talking about today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism in the region is currently worth $700 million per annum and is, therefore, an absolutely vital industry. For the purposes of the project being debated this afternoon, tourism has been defined as any business that will benefit directly from a visitor to the area. It, therefore, includes accommodation, restaurants, takeaway food outlets, clubs, hotels, rail, air, taxi and bus services, service stations and retail outlets. They will all benefit from a growth in tourism&mdash;something that the local committee is trying to promote and generate in the face of all the impediments imposed by the current government that I outlined earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the unemployment rate on Australia's holiday coast at the present time is 17 per cent, double the national average of 8.5 per cent. Another interesting figure is that 60 per cent of the unemployed are over 45 years of age. There are 6,000 registered long-term unemployed in the region&mdash;6,000 people who have been looking for work but have been unable to find it for 18 months or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While praising the work of the local body and the goodwill that these local people have created throughout the community, I believe there are some fundamental problems with the new work opportunities program run by this government. One such problem is that the program focus is too narrow. To be eligible, you have to be continuously unemployed for 18 months or longer. I have received many complaints from constituents within my electorate about the narrow focus of the groups that are targeted. They claim that the program verges on discrimination by locking out all those people who have been unemployed for under 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, I received one complaint recently from a Michael Smith from Taree who has been unemployed for 12 months. During that time, in an attempt to better himself, he has been undertaking a business course at TAFE, without Austudy support and without jobsearch support. When he finishes his course, he will need to remain unemployed for a further 18 months before being eligible to participate in any aspect of this program or the new work opportunities program. He believes that the criteria that the government has set out is discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the local committee have also made the critical comment that the target groups are too narrow. It is restricting when trying to find the best people to place in the tourism industry&mdash;those who will have the best chance of having long-term employment. After all, this is what the government tells us this program is all about: getting people back into long-term employment&mdash;not short-term employment and not just for the 26 weeks of the program or to hide the unemployment figures. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training tells us that this is about getting people back into full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee has made the comment that the government has hindered them because of the narrow focus of the target group&mdash;that is, it focuses on those who have been unemployed for 18 months or longer. If the committee were able to access a broader cross-section of the unemployed within the community, it would have a better chance of training and placing people into long-term jobs. That is one local criticism that has been made of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the performance of the program nationally. The 1994-95 target was 11,700 placements, yet the government has admitted that only 8,000 unemployed people have been placed in the program. With the slow start to the program, we are very sceptical about the government really cranking up the program in 1995-96&mdash;which is, oddly enough, an election period. Officers from the Department of Employment, Education and Training have already admitted in evidence at estimates committees that there will be a significant jump in participants in the 1995-96 year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has also indicated that unfilled places in 1994-95 will flow over into 1995-96, which could swell the commencements to 38,500 people. Bear in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these people will be removed from the unemployment statistics; they will be removed from sight. The government does not realise that people in the community are sceptical and are saying, `We know where these people are.' But let us see at the end of these programs whether they come back again or whether they end up getting full-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these people will come off the unemployment statistics, yet they are on a 26-week program. We hope for their sake&mdash;because we need to have some sympathy, empathy and compassion for the unemployed in this country&mdash;and not the government's, that their 26 weeks of subsidised training and work turns into a full-time job. It would be out of place for me to predict the long-term employment prospects of the participants in Australia's holiday coast project. However, I can only wish them my best, sincerely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the government having already conceded that as many as seven out of every 10 participants could still be unemployed at the end of the program, I wish the committee and the participants in this project on Australia's holiday coast a much better success rate than the government predicts for Australia. That prediction came in evidence given to a Senate estimates committee. The officers of DEET have admitted in Senate estimates within the last fortnight that possibly as many as seven out of 10 participants are expected to return to the unemployment rolls at the conclusion of their participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that this does not happen with this program. I certainly hope that a majority of unemployed people who participate in this project on Australia's holiday coast end up in full-time employment. It will be due to the very committed, diligent, good work being performed by that committee on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, which, despite the lackadaisical performance in some aspects by the DEET bureaucracy, has got this far with this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been brought to my attention that the government and the department have been unacceptably slow in getting the funding through to Jobs North, which is the body running this project on Australia's holiday coast. Jobs North is currently $1.2 million in debt. It received $300,000 from the department and a further $1 million has been promised by Friday. Let us hope this money arrives on time, as promised. The local committee has acted in good faith and, at the moment, has left itself extremely exposed while waiting for the government to come good with this first instalment. I urge the government and the minister to ensure that that first instalment arrives to Jobs North when promised, on Friday of this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I reiterate my sincere best wishes to the local committee that is running this project and to the participants that will be involved in it. As I said before, with the government having already conceded that as many as seven out of every 10 participants could still be unemployed at the end of new work opportunities program, I wish this committee on Australia's holiday coast, and the participants, a much better success rate than the government has predicted for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and to congratulate him on his ringing endorsement of the value of new work opportunities, the value of targeting long-term unemployed and the value of area coordinating committees. This is, of course, in stark contrast to the vast majority of those opposite. When the Working Nation program was delivered by the government, it was described by their leader at the time as `unnecessary expenditure'. That left them handcuffed to the approach to unemployment and long-term unemployment which they had had at the last election, which was a three-pronged approach to unemployment: essentially, to tip people off the dole after nine months; to reduce outlays in expenditure on labour market programs by $800 million; and&mdash;the centrepiece of all their policy objectives&mdash;to slash wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the member for Lyne has recognised in his motion the great value of the new work opportunities program and of the area consultative committee regional arrangements, which arose out of the Working Nation initiatives. The honourable member's motion refers to the work of the area consultative committee in establishing a comprehensive plan and also to the new work opportunities program having the full support of the business and community organisations throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The starting point of the member's motion was the government's Working Nation statement, which contained these particular programs and which was presented to the parliament in May 1994. The philosophical approach behind Working Nation was to take special measures to ensure that long-term unemployed people were not left behind as economic growth ensured that unemployment was reduced and employment increased. That philosophy is expressed in a crystal clear way in the first two pages of the Working Nation white paper. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic growth is the best way of generating new and worthwhile jobs to meet the needs of an expanding workforce and to make inroads into unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While economic growth is the key, waiting for growth alone will not suffice. To bring unemployment down more rapidly the Government will intervene directly to assist long term unemployed people, and those at risk of becoming long term employed. This, in turn, will increase the rate of economic growth that can be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the great lesson to be learned out of earlier recessions in the 1970s and 1980s: unless governments and the community took special measures a pool of long-term unemployed people would be left behind. The centrepiece of the special measures was effectively the job compact, of which the new work opportunities program is a part. The area consultative committees form part of the regional measures to ensure that regional employment is maximised and that the regions focus on reducing long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us have a look at the success rate of the particular measures to date. I do not need to echo the comments of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) at question time today. I simply refer to his official press release on unemployment data dated 8 June in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABS Labour Force figures for May show a fall in the trend rate of unemployment to 8.4 per cent, the lowest since December 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to indicate the unemployment rates on a state by state basis. I was particularly pleased to see that my own state of Western Australia, with a rate of 7.4 per cent, continues to lead the nation in reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also made the point that the employment growth we have seen since the 1993 election has enabled the government to exceed its commitment to create an additional 500,000 jobs over the three-year term of office and to reach this goal in less than two-thirds of the time. He noted that, at the same time, the number of long-term unemployed people has fallen by between 21 and 25 per cent. On all previous comparable figures, that massively improved reduction is a result of the targeted measures that we saw in the Working Nation program. As I said, the centrepiece of the special measures to ensure that long-term unemployed people are not left behind was the job compact. I quote again from Working Nation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The Government has decided to introduce an ambitious Job Compact that will provide a job placement for people who have been on unemployment allowances for more than 18 months. In return, long term unemployed people will be under an obligation to accept a reasonable job offer or lose their entitlement to income support for a period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The placements will involve worthwhile jobs, primarily in the private sector. This will maximise the opportunity for the employee to be retained in the job. There will also be a role for communities to identify and manage worthwhile projects which will provide long term unemployed people with work experience to better equip them for subsequent employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers will be encouraged to provide recognised training. When this is offered, employees will be paid a training wage to reflect the cost of the training to the employer and the future advantages to the employee.</PARA>
<PARA>The new work opportunities program and the area consultative committees fall under the characterisation of `a role for communities to identify and manage worthwhile projects'. In the Working Nation statement, the white paper statement, at page 122 we find a description of the new work opportunities program and at page 133 we find a description of the area consultative committee under the heading `Improved links with regional development'. I will not take the time of the House to go through those but, if I can go in reverse order, the success of the area consultative committees was outlined by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training at a national conference of area consultative committees in Melbourne on 23 March when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially the area consultative committee structure is a series of jobs teams.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a perfect description. That has certainly been the case in my own electorate and it is certainly the case in the area of the member for Lyne, who moved the motion before us today. The minister went on in his speech to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 560,000 job target that was passed last week one year ahead of time exceeded the target, exceeded the time so that jobs are occurring. The real challenge for the regions is how they can get a slice of that action, how they can ensure that the jobs growth that is occurring, off the back of the economic growth, is attracted to their particular region. It's extraordinary what we've got is regions competing so the question is how do regions get a slice of that action.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the substance, giving substance, if you like, to regional economic development. It's a government committed to responding to your&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he was referring to the regions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">needs through program money that is adaptable and flexible.</PARA>
<PARA>I was pleased that the minister visited my electorate in Perth last month, in May, and formally launched the North Metropolitan Perth Area Consultative Committee to be chaired by Neil Hamilton, the chairman of Challenge Bank in Western Australia. The consultative committee has as some of its representatives Mr Charlie Gregorini, the President of Swan shire, which is in my electorate; and Mr Brian Hunt, the chairman of the Midland Enterprise Centre, a most successful business incubator and enterprise centre in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of formally launching the North Metropolitan Perth Area Consultative Committee, the minister announced that the area consultative committee's target was to create 12,000 job opportunities in that area in the next six months. I am pleased that that program is under way. In the course of his visit, the minister also took the opportunity to visit a very successful new work opportunities program in the city of Bayswater, which is a local authority in my electorate. The activity of the city of Bayswater in successfully pursuing the project management of the new work opportunities program outlines the great potential for success that the new work opportunities program opens up. Page 122 of One Nation says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Work Opportunities will be a key element in ensuring that the Job Compact can be delivered to all eligible job seekers even if they live in areas where employment opportunities are limited . . . New Work Opportunities will also be the most appropriate employment option to meet the needs of some job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A crucial part of the Job Compact is the facility of New Work Opportunities to draw on the initiative, concerns and needs of local communities. The program will be regionally organised and managed. It will provide an opportunity for local communities to assist the unemployed and for unemployed people to contribute to their communities.</PARA>
<PARA>The One Nation statement goes on to refer to the area consultative committees having a role in seeking projects from the local community, including community groups, local councils, semi-commercial groups and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The city of Bayswater is managing a number of successful new work opportunities projects in conjunction with the Department of Employment, Education and Training. They include the restoration of Ellis House, the second oldest house in the city of Bayswater, which the minister inspected on his visit to my electorate. That program is providing job and training opportunities for long-term unemployed people at a total project cost of over $175,000. As a result of the success of that project, the city of Bayswater has embarked on two major new work opportunities programs utilising capital works funds of the city of Bayswater and the new work opportunities program to provide for an over $2 million project to restore the old city of Bayswater town site and for a second over $2 million project to ensure that the Progress Street precinct in Morly in my electorate is upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are great examples of the aspiration of the new work opportunities program. It provides the training, skills and employment opportunities for long-term unemployed over 26 weeks, but leaves the community with a long-term better infrastructure. The initiative of the city of Bayswater and its councillors in pursuing these projects is a great testimony to their aspirations to ensure that local unemployed people in their city have those opportunities but also commit themselves to a massively upgraded infrastructure in their local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That activity is being mirrored by the shire of Swan. I have referred to the Shire President, Councillor Charlie Gregorini, as being a member of the area consultative committee. The shire of Swan is in the course of pursuing three new work opportunities projects with the department. They include the restoration of Midland Town Hall, the upgrading of the infrastructure in Stirling Gardens in Guildford, and the restoration and upgrading of facilities at Goodchild Oval in Bellevue. All of these projects, which I hope will come to a successful conclusion shortly, will provide long-term unemployed people from the shire of Swan, particularly Midland and Bellevue, with the opportunity of picking up skills which will make them `job ready'&mdash;an expression that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) used in the House when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It will also ensure that the shire of Swan upgrades its infrastructure leaving behind a better infrastructure for local purposes. </PARA>

The subject of the motion is a very clearly and closely defined area. It is a region which encompasses the federal electorates of Lyne and Cowper&mdash;Cowper being my electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I talk about that committee I must take up with the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) some of the issues that he raised because he was wrong in a number of areas. He said that the member for Lyne&mdash;and by inference me too&mdash;supported all area consultative committees. That is not true; that is not correct. We do not know what the other areas are doing. We know what our own area is doing. It is on the ball. It has been very innovative, as I have said. It has something which stands a chance of success, but I do not know about the other committees. So there is no way the honourable member can say that we support all of the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also said we supported the new work opportunities program. That, too, is wrong. There is no way that we will give a blank cheque to the new work opportunities program because that is part of a scheme which artificially diminishes the number of long-term unemployed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does come from Perth, which is a long way away. I know he has trouble getting home, but he is coming from the deep, distant past where there has been some form of class war. We are not in the business of slashing wages. We are in the business of creating opportunities for people to earn more. That is what this program is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also said, completely erroneously, that we are in the business of tipping people off the dole after nine months. That is one of the great furphies, the great falsehoods, that arose from the last federal election. I think it is typical and indicative of the government's lack of being able to criticise anything we do that it has to go back so far to try to drag up from a morass some assertion which was wrong then and is wrong now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also made the point that this program was commenced as part of the Working Nation initiatives, which sought to do something about long-term unemployed. Nobody in this place is not concerned about fellow Australians who are unemployed and who desperately want to get a job, in particular those who are long-term unemployed. That is disastrous for those people. I, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, meet a great many of them. It is heartbreaking because most of them are fair dinkum about wanting to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that this government is pursuing a program of hiding the unemployed. I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to last year's budget in which there were a number of programs&mdash;the new work opportunities program is only one&mdash;that were designed specifically to shift the long-term unemployed sideways to get them off the unemployment list. In that budget the government brought in a program which would allow widows who were long-term unemployed to come off the unemployment list and be moved sideways to the widows pension. A person with a child at home and who was long-term unemployed was moved sideways as well and given the carers allowance. A male who was over 60 and long-term unemployed would come off the unemployment list and get the old age pension&mdash;just like that. Then we have other work programs which move the long-term unemployed into employment for a period of six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of those provisions in last year's budget is that by the end of the third quarter of this year, by the end of September&mdash;which coincidentally will be probably just before the election&mdash;there will be the artificial removal from the long-term unemployed list of something like a quarter of a million people. In actual fact the figures worked out at the last budget were that 263,000 people would be artificially shunted off the unemployment figures. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could stand up and stick in his thumb and pull out a plum and say, `What a good boy am I.' The people of Australia are not dills. They are not dopes. They will not be taken in by this thumb and plum trick, and that is what the Prime Minister is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme we are talking about has a chance of success. I will give praise where praise is due. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has provided, in addition to the $10 million for the 1,000 jobs we are seeking to provide, $4 million for marketing and promotion of the tourism industry. Otherwise this scheme would be no different from all the others where employers can say they will put on somebody for 26 weeks. We have seen what happens at the end of that period. Even the government has said that its expectation is&mdash;I anticipate that my friends the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the member for Paterson (Mr Horne), who are going to speak after me, might tell me that I am wrong but I am not, as indicated by the figures&mdash;</PARA>

The chairman of the committee is John Ross, who owns McDonalds in Port Macquarie and Taree. There are a number of others, including Gordon McLeod from Southern Cross University and Craig Bowen from the Nautilus Resort in my area. They work very hard on that committee. They came up with a proposition that does not just say we should provide a job for an unemployed person for six months and then at the end of the six months say ta-ta, too bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the marketing program&mdash;which is, as I said, $4 million; the first burst will be $3 million&mdash;we are seeking to involve a whole range of activities, such as television commercials, brochures and leaflets. It will seek to significantly increase the numbers coming to the holiday coast, which encompasses the electorates of Lyne and Cowper, in the hope that people will be able to stay in jobs. Without that $4 million being made available for marketing, we would be really pushing this proposition uphill. It would be very difficult, as has been found everywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Perth said that many will be getting a slice of the action. Anybody can get a slice of the action. Anybody can go to DEET and to the CES and say they are prepared to put on somebody. But of course seven out of 10 will not stay on. It is also interesting to note that, with $10 million being spent on people to be employed for six months, or 26 weeks&mdash;six weeks of training and then 20 weeks on the job&mdash;people will earn $20,000 a year, which is not a princely sum, I must say, but at least it is better than being on the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To demonstrate that I am not talking in an idle fashion, I point out that lots of other activities have tried to get involved in the new work opportunities program. One that comes to mind is Operation Restoration. I believe all of us in this House are totally supportive of the Australia Remembers 1945-95 campaign.

Unfortunately, it was too hard. To my knowledge, not one person in my electorate of Cowper has been able to get a job under Operation Restoration.

I certainly wish them well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the example presented in the honourable member for Lyne's motion. It represents how two colleagues from the opposition side have embarked on a process with those in their business community&mdash;they have obviously said to them that here is a program we can make work&mdash;and worked with their business community to make it work. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about a partnership between elected representatives, regardless of what side of politics they come from, and the business community. After all, the business community is going to be the beneficiary of having people who are trained, with more skills, more disposable income and thus a higher standard of living and all that goes with it, providing the services to the tourists who come to that magnificent area of Cowper and Lyne. Some tourists will even venture into Page and I hope some will stop in Paterson on the way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that we have here an acceptance that this program is successful. I wonder how many members opposite do not look as constructively at programs that are offered by this government as the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper have and how many members opposite say, `This is a government program. We do not want it to work.' I feel there are many opposition members out there saying that, and they are denying the unemployed young people of their area the opportunity to get into jobs through training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics of One Nation and new work opportunities are too good. I do not agree with the member for Cowper when he says, in a cynical manner&mdash;and I can understand why he has to say it&mdash;that we are simply trying to fudge numbers. Before I came to this place I was a teacher. I got out of teaching five or six years ago. I worked with labour market programs in the TAFE system. I can assure both of the members opposite that most labour market programs&mdash;I would say all labour market programs&mdash;are a sincere attempt to train young people so they will have the skills to fit into an ever changing work force pattern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously there is going to be some evolutionary process. Obviously there are people who attend training programs who are probably not suited to participate in that particular program. Obviously there will be failures. But the point is that most of the labour market programs are carried out in a sincere manner. I venture to say that, if the people who complete these courses do not get a job, it is through no fault of their own. It may be that there are no positions available for those particular skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the strength of new work opportunities and the strength of the area consultative committee is that the government or government bureaucracies are not saying to the ACC, `This is the range of skills you have to teach.' The ACC is in the driving seat. It selects the skills that are needed in its area and it devises the courses. That is why it has a better chance of being successful. All I ask is that all members of this House look at it in a constructive manner and look at the aim of the minister.

In the last 12 months unemployment numbers have fallen by 11 per cent and long-term unemployed numbers have fallen by almost 21 per cent. I do not believe those figures have been fudged. I know that in my own area&mdash;in the Hunter region, which is immediately to the south of the area covered by the two honourable members opposite&mdash;many of the young people have found employment purely as a result of training programs and purely as a result of gaining new skills.

That is to be commended. It is a positive step. The staff of DEET are also to be commended for working with the communities. Theirs is a thankless task. They have to deal with the failures of our education system, the failures of our employment system, people who have been made redundant, people who have very low self-esteem, people who do not particularly want to look for a job, people who have found a place in the safety net and who often are content to stay there. These are the people whom DEET have to deal with. Many members are critical of DEET staff because they feel that they do not understand. They do understand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many government members want to speak on this subject because we are very proud of this system. I think it is the best system that has been devised yet. I personally taught in jobskills programs that I thought were too short. They did not give people enough time to appreciate what they were about. The 26 weeks gives each of the young people who participate in the program an identity; they can identify with their workplace. They know their skills. It gives the employer, the person who is providing the workplace opportunity for them, the opportunity to assess them: `Maybe I do have a place in my organisation to provide this person with a permanent job.' Obviously that has to be decided down the track. In many cases it will be of mutual benefit to them both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, because of my experience with labour market programs, I have gone out of my way to find employers who would participate in labour market programs. I have personally found new work opportunities to be an excellent program. There are a number of them running in my electorate. I have used local councils and grants from other departments. I will give an example. The Great Lakes Council was extremely fortunate to get a tourism infrastructure grant of $160,000 for an information centre for the Myall Lakes to be constructed at Bulahdelah. That will be matched dollar for dollar. The value of it is that new work opportunities will provide much of the labour. So on the one hand there has been a federal grant through the Department of Tourism to provide this infrastructure that is vitally necessary for the area and, with new work opportunities coming in behind, much more in real value is going to be added to that project. I can assure members that Great Lakes Council is delighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been fortunate enough in Maitland to get a similar grant by exactly the same process. In each of these programs dozens of young people will be trained and will learn skills. The federal government will pay the bill. But, as in the ad, it keeps getting better. The local community receives the benefits immediately. The local community sees the value of the infrastructure that is provided. It sees the value of these young people having jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we often hear from the other side is that young people in country towns throughout Australia have to leave town. I know that; I reared my children in a country town. In that town there are very few job opportunities. My children do not reside there now; they are working in other places. One of the reasons for this is that the local community never sees the value in employing young people from their own community. The honourable member's area is a growth area. That local community will see the value in employing their own local product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as tourism is concerned, no-one knows it better than a locally grown person. There is value to the tourism industry in having someone who knows the local community, who knows the local area, who knows where you can go to surf, who knows where you can go to fish, who knows where you can go to have a good meal, who knows where you can go to have a nice quiet day. Just talking to those people as they are filling your car with petrol, selling you a hamburger, servicing your motel room, car or whatever&mdash;that is the value of having your local community working locally. </PARA>

Get rid of that party political bias because it is not intended that way. It is there for all. If you do not wish to use the programs, we cannot force them on you.

I suspect that today, despite the government's attempts to hide them at every opportunity, there are probably close to 400,000 long-term unemployed, give or take a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our experience, we understand that it is very difficult to reduce the size of this pool of long-term unemployed as the recovery comes. We are yet to see it last more than five minutes but, assuming there is some recovery down the track, participation rates will increase. As that happens, it tends to exacerbate the situation that the long-term unemployed find themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underlying all of this, when we are talking about unemployment, is the fact that the statistics vastly underestimate the extent of the problem. We generally find that there are almost as many people underemployed in the economy at any one time as there are unemployed. Those who are underemployed are those who want to work more hours, have simply dropped out of the work force having given up, are looking for jobs or are looking for part-time work and cannot find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Paterson asked why some of us do not participate as enthusiastically, or do not fall for the government's propaganda, to quite the same extent as some government members do. That is simply because we have had some very bad experiences with many of these programs. We have come to believe that to a large extent many of them are scams or smokescreens that are thrown up to make it appear outside that the government is doing something to solve the problem which, as I say, it created in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members who have supported this motion are prepared to give it a go in respect of at least one particular program. I have not had a totally jaundiced view of these programs. I have received a lot of good cooperation from DEET, despite its being a fairly unwieldy bureaucracy. As far as I can, I work with my local Commonwealth Employment Service and get, by and large, very good service from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All my criticism here is aimed at the government, and I cast no aspersions whatsoever on the many good intentioned, hardworking public servants who staff those instrumentalities. They do their best. Frankly, without giving out too many secrets, in talking to them you often find that they are as frustrated about some of the programs they are having to administer as we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some glaring occurrences where programs have been introduced without the staff at these instrumentalities, whether it be DSS or CES, having been fully employed, briefed or trained about how to implement the programs. A reason for this could be that the government has sometimes been in such a rush to appear as though it was actually doing something. That is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To his credit, the member for Paterson stood up and spoke from his heart about this matter. He posed the question about whether we on this side of the House have some bias against these programs, that simply because they have been introduced by the government we will not cooperate. The fact is that we are concerned and are prepared to give it a go but a lot of the time we have been frustrated, disappointed and disillusioned by what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had actually managed the economy properly in the first place, it would not have needed all these programs. It created these problems. Working Nation, like many of the government's grand schemes&mdash;and we could talk about those going back a number of years&mdash;has failed by most accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistical decline in long-term unemployment since Working Nation began is more than fully explained by the redefinition of 70,000 long-term unemployed people as short-term unemployed after putting them through labour market programs. This is well documented, and everyone outside knows this is going on. They come off long-term unemployment because they go on to some program, and when they come off the program they go back on to the unemployment queues. However, they are no longer classified as being long-term unemployed because they are back at the other end of the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first six months of Working Nation, commencements in jobstart, which was the government's major and most successful labour market program, collapsed to 30,000 lower than in the same period the previous year. Commencements in skillshare were also lower than in the year before Working Nation started. The number of young people in traineeships has also collapsed, and is also likely to be below the commencement target of the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal of contracting out 10 per cent of case management services is now a year behind schedule. It is now possible that, despite all the promises from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) about increasing help to unemployed people, the first year of Working Nation will actually produce a reduction in effective help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the rhetoric we hear about Working Nation, a look at the facts shows that it has not delivered very much at all, although it is true that it has cost the Australian taxpayers an awful amount of money. As we say, and the government is unable to repute this, the government's major objective, major thrust&mdash;and hence our suspicion&mdash;is to hide unemployment and create the spectre that it is actually doing something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), revealed recently that evidence is emerging that the government has held back the new work opportunities program until the election year when it will be making extensive use of the program to hide the unemployed and launder the unemployment statistics, and apparently this was more or less confirmed in the Senate estimates. The indicative target for commencements in this program for 1994-95 was 11,700, but the government has admitted in the most recent hearings of the Senate estimates that to date only 8,000 unemployed people have started the program. While unemployed people are participating in the program, they are not counted as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-term unemployed people who have been through the program and are still unemployed at the end will be reclassified as short-term unemployed, which is the situation with a lot of these programs. The government has already conceded that as many as seven out of 10 could be unemployed at the end of the program. The situation exists, and we are all familiar with it, that after 26 weeks work they are back on the other end of the queue again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a few days of the 1994-95 year left, this slow start gives the government scope to rapidly build up commencements in the 26 weeks leading up to the election and remain within the targets set. Mr Bob Harvey, the Assistant Secretary to the Workskills Branch, has admitted that `a significant jump' in participants is expected in the forthcoming financial year. You might be a bit surprised about the potential for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training has admitted that contracts for 18,000 places have been signed to date. If these places are not filled in 1994-95, which is about to finish, the places will flow over to 1995-96. The 1995-96 target for the program is 35,000. If the numbers from the target for 1994-95 which were not met are added, it will give a total of almost 38,500 commencements for the election year. All of those 38,500 people will come off the unemployment statistics. If the government plays games like that, well might we be suspicious about its bona fides in respect of all these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new work opportunities program provides long-term unemployed people with 26 weeks of specific work. These are regarded as jobs for the purpose of the job compact, even though the job will generally not survive the life of the project and for half a year the participants are not regarded as unemployed. Our contention in relation to this and most of the other programs is that they are not all they are trumped up to be. In the end, they are about making it appear as though the government is actually doing something when in fact it is doing very little at great cost to the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new work opportunities program that is the subject of the motion is, by government standards, actually not too bad. I am happy to give a bit of credit where it is due. People who know me know that I am not totally one-eyed in relation to these matters, but the program that has been introduced on the Gold Coast does appear to be heading in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 16 members of the community consultative committee, which was set up to oversee the new work opportunities program.

<PARA>But some members opposite say that it will not work anywhere else. In my electorate, the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee was first established on 4 October 1994 by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), whom those opposite praised loudly. The area consultative committee function in this region is carried out by the Northern Rivers Regional Economic Development Organisation, which is an incorporated body of 23 peak regional bodies working as a federation to support, coordinate and drive appropriate economic development and hence employment within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NOREDO has developed a strategic plan entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Turning vision into reality</EMPHASIS> which, through the Northern Rivers ACC, will link the Commonwealth's employment programs with federal initiatives for economic development in regional Australia. The members of the committee include representatives from private enterprise, NOROC, employer organisations, regional economic development organisations, trade unions, social welfare organisations and tertiary institutions. One of the aims of NOREDO, in its role as the Northern Rivers ACC, is that it will strive for best practice use of labour market programs to assist DEET in increasing employment opportunities, reducing unemployment and raising the skills levels of the region's work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive members of NOREDO are: Dr Jim Gallagher, the chairman, who is from the North Coast Combined Unions Committee&mdash;he is in the gallery tonight&mdash;Mr Chris Clare, secretary, from NOROC; Mr Stuart Moon from the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board; Dr Alan Davies from the Southern Cross University; and Ms Bronwyn Anderson from the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Canberra today a delegation from NOREDO received strong and enthusiastic support from the federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training for an innovative package of job initiatives, through the federal government's Working Nation program. The delegation, led by the member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and me, included Dr Jim Gallagher; Steve Hauville, from the Regional Chambers of Commerce; Harry Ellis, representing the Tweed office of the Labour Market Adjustment Committee; Kevin Collison, President of the North Coast Council of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales; and Chris Clare, Secretary of NOROC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister congratulated NOREDO for the package development and proposal and said that this is the type of cooperative effort across political parties, the three tiers of government, industry and community the government wants to see. I imagine that is similar to the reception you got in relation to the mid-coast proposal. Working together is the only way to achieve progress. The minister saw that this program would lead to traineeships, particularly in the area of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell members a little about the program that has been developed and put to DEET. It aims to create 500 jobs in tourism, including ecotourism, especially in the rainforest areas of the far north coast. NOREDO will target 500 employers in the tourism, ecotourism and related industries within the region from Tweed Heads to south of the Clarence River. This will build on the strategy development for ecotourism in the region, for which the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board recently received a grant of $230,000 from the Commonwealth Department of Tourism. That strategy will involve substantial employment and training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to small business, it is envisaged that the memorandum of understanding between the Northern Rivers combined chambers of commerce and the unions will facilitate a flow-on of the scheme, which is currently making placements in Lismore, to other parts of the region. The aim is to create 500 positions in small business. The training program pattern adopted is for two weeks initial training before placement, and then one day per week over the next 24 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to manufacturing, it wishes to create 300 jobs. These placements will be based on three factors: the relevance to the potential growth of that industry; the potential of the business to improve service and hence prosperity; and the potential of the industry to move into the export market or import replacement market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farming and agribusiness sector has enormous potential within the north coast region. Placements will be on the basis of individual submissions to NOREDO and will be determined in relation to the following criteria: relief to farmers in need; potential for growth and/or value adding in a range of industries in this sector; and potential for export. Placements and training will be made in conjunction with the New South Wales Farmers Federation, where applicable, and under the supervision of the relevant industry association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aiming for 250 positions in the area called `other sectors'. This area has been provided in recognition of the fact that traditional jobs and traditional work are not necessarily as directly viable in some communities on the north coast. For example, the Lismore Skills Centre has opened an office in Nimbin to undertake the establishment of employment opportunities in that town which has particular problems. Individual projects will flow from groups such as this to the ACC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare the government's position which I have just outlined with that of the opposition. The new work opportunities program and the whole raft of programs will not work anywhere else in Australia. I challenge those opposite to say to the people and the organisations to which I have just referred that this program will not work. They are confident it will; I am confident it will. If those opposite do not agree with that, they should tell these people and organisations. Those opposite have shown that they do not agree with it because they have said that it will work only in the mid-coast. I think they are wrong in saying that and that this program can work all over Australia. Our areas have particular problems, and we are addressing them. This is not a good position for those opposite to take. It really runs down these people and people in other areas of Australia who want to get things going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to discuss the effect of these programs on regional development. On the north coast of New South Wales, we have had high structural unemployment for decades. Over the last couple of years, we have seen a downward trend in unemployment in my electorate and further north. This is the first time we have ever seen a downward trend in unemployment in my electorate, and I am hopeful that this change will continue. For decades we have been ignored. We have not had programs of this type to assist us. We are attempting&mdash;we have a lot of confidence in the local people&mdash;to bring people together to get those programs up and running and to improve the employment situation and economic growth on the north coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the duplicity of the stance taken by those opposite in this regard. I also want to refer to their stance on regional development. In April 1994, the then shadow minister, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), issued a confidential statement headed `Structural reform management group: Assessment of portfolio initiatives: Regional and rural development'. Under the heading `Infrastructure', the statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to set a figure ($1 billion, $3 billion&mdash;the actual number is insignificant) as an indication of our commitment to putting roads, dams, ports, airports, bridges, whatever, into regional Australia. We should also then allude to some sort of assessment procedure by which regions can directly seek funding for these projects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the figure does not matter. Those opposite are going to set a figure and say, `Look, you can apply for this money.' They will allude to some sort of assessment procedure. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Policies which are attractive to business will serve the dual purpose of actually stimulating investment and also winning the vote of influential community opinion leaders.</PARA>
<PARA>From my reading of that document, those opposite intend to say that money is available and allude to some sort of assessment procedure, but they have no commitment to proceed. That document was released over a year ago. I have another document, released more than a year later, which continues in the same vein. This document was released by the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure. As I said, the previous document to which I referred was released by the then shadow minister, the member for Maranoa. He has been shifted from that position&mdash;perhaps because of that document. The new shadow minister is Senator Ian Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document by the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure is headed `Briefing paper to shadow cabinet'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complete copies of the draft policy for Regional Development and Infrastructure are tabled.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `The Grand Vision', the document reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long term visionary projects we would specifically like the Council to investigate and prioritise, for example: Darwin to Alice railway, turning coastal waters inland, rejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin, Adelaide Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.</PARA>
<PARA>If I were a member of the opposition, I would be ashamed of that. This document, which the shadow minister says is just personal notes, mentions twice the federal secretariat. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my assessment, supported by the Federal Secretariat, that we need to approach infrastructure from both the grand vision and the localised angle.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 3 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This particular approach is strongly endorsed by the Federal Secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow minister tries to excuse what is contained in this document headed `Briefing paper to shadow cabinet' by saying that they are personal notes. If you cop that, you are pretty silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has demonstrated absolute duplicity in two ways. The first is the way in which this motion supports the programs of the government but only in a particular area. Those opposite are unwilling to come out and criticise the program to which I referred, yet they have said they would not work in any other place in Australia. The second relates to the comments of your shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure which imply that we should treat the people of regional Australia like goats and say, `We're going to go out there and make commitments that we have no intention of keeping.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an interesting debate.

Those members who have been in this parliament for some time have had an opportunity to get involved in any number of these programs. Some of them have been much better than others. I would hope that there would be a feeling of hope with regard to this particular program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution, my friend the member for McPherson gave a bit of a run-down of his program on the Gold Coast which, while centred in his electorate and the electorate of Moncrieff, in actual fact now moves into the new electorate of Fadden. He did not mention the size of the investment in the program on the Gold Coast. From memory I think it is about $1.46 million over some four years. In that area, they expect something like 430 job commencements to be undertaken in that time. So it is not an unsubstantial investment in a program like this.

I have every confidence in the Gold Coast because of the very nature of the Gold Coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what worries me is the enormity of the challenge to try to do something in terms of the unemployment program in the regional centres of Australia. As I say, the examples that have been given to us by the members for Lyne and Cowper are good ones, but looking at the unemployment rate in some of these centres in Queensland at the moment it really is quite a frightening prospect. The challenge for whatever work program it might be, in particular the new work opportunity program, is going to be immense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go through the latest labour force figures that were supplied to us a week or two ago, you will see that in places like Hervey Bay the unemployment rate is 16.4 per cent; in Bundaberg it is 13.3 per cent; in Caloundra, 13 per cent; in Gympie, 12.6 per cent; in Maryborough, 10.7 per cent; in  Rockhampton, 10.6 per cent; in Mackay, 10.2 per cent; and in Gladstone, 10 per cent. They are very big figures. That is going to be a very big challenge because the make-up of much of those figures is the younger unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go into a further analysis of the labour force figures in Queensland at the moment, it is really quite frightening. The figures released the other day show that the participation rate in Queensland decreased to 65.3 per cent. There was a decrease in employment of 15,983 to 1.503 million. There was a decrease in full-time employment of 14,871, a decrease in part-time employment of 1,112 and an increase in unemployment of 15,324 persons; and the unemployment rate increased to 9.3 per cent&mdash;the Australian average is 8.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an increase in the male unemployment rate of one per cent to 9.5 per cent&mdash;the Australian average is 8.9 per cent. There was an increase in the female unemployment rate to 8.9 per cent&mdash;the Australian average is eight per cent. There was an increase of 2,755 in the number of persons aged 15 to 19 who were looking for full-time work. That is the sort of challenge we are facing in my state and certainly in the major regional centres of Queensland. I wish the committees that will be involved in the program all the very best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has come through to me tonight in this debate is that at the bottom of it all there seems to be an awful lot of confidence in the future of the tourist industry. It was interesting because the member for Paterson (Mr Horne) cited the example of a grant that came through from the Department of Tourism, which was then followed up by his committee, to put in an interpretive centre, and that was going to supply a few jobs over the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Page quoted statistics on what ecotourism may or may not be able to provide in his particular electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know I do not have to convince you. Some of your colleagues behind you have been pretty slow. If the decision to commence Badgerys Creek two years earlier had been taken when it should have been taken, what would have been the employment effect? What would have been the employment effect on the central coast of New South Wales?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest difficulties that we have in some of these regional areas is access and the cost of access. The minister at the table is a former minister for aviation. I think it is absolutely magnificent that, for example, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has been sitting on the new charter policy for two years. I do not know what he has been doing&mdash;whether he has not had time to read it while he is trying to organise some industrial relations or whatever it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen a copy of the proposed new policy and, quite frankly, it is pretty good. If you are going to open up that sort of access and if you can allow limited direct charters into places like the central coast of New South Wales&mdash;and technically that is quite possible&mdash;what will be the effect on employment generation there? There are just so many areas. The other classic was the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1995, which was before the House yesterday. The opposition in the Senate amended the bill so that small tourist operators could get in the business of promoting overseas, and what happened? The government immediately knocked it on the head in here again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is just not a realisation of what government administrations can do to physically stifle employment opportunities in this country. That is really sad. If the government, whether it be federal, state or local, just got out of the system for a day or two and said, `Right, fellas, quick, fix up what you reckon is wrong,' this country would boom and we would probably have to import labour to be able to handle the business that that would generate. While it is all very well and commendable to have these programs under way, we really have to start looking more seriously at some of the root causes of unemployment that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just on that matter of tourism and on the matter of the central coast of New South Wales and those regional areas of Queensland, the fact that every time you get a net increase of 24,000 people into your area you can create another 1,250 jobs&mdash;these are not my figures; they are the figures of your department&mdash;is really quite staggering. We are talking of spending $1.46 million over four years on the Gold Coast scheme and we hope to get 430 placements. I suggest that, if you let direct charters into Coolangatta and you could get a net increase of 48,000 international visitors on a direct charter basis over the next six months, you would create 2,500 jobs without costing you a brass razoo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, we have to start looking at other areas. When we start talking about expending government funds, if we are going to be so dependent, as every speaker in this debate seems to be, on the future of tourism providing jobs, we will have to start looking at some of the government restrictions on infrastructure and infrastructure development that we have. Why is it that the Sheraton hotel chain has something like 52 hotels under construction around Asia but not one in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have this booming industry, how many hotels do we have under construction in Australia now? I think the answer is three. Yet you have occupancy rates in places like Cairns of over 90 per cent. That is fine. That brings in an awful lot of revenue and creates an awful lot of jobs in areas like that, but there are people knocking on the door trying to get in and we are saying, `You cannot come in because we don't have enough beds for you.' We are not making any real attempt to change the situation. This is happening not only in the major areas but also in areas like the Gold Coast, which is experiencing incredible occupancy rates at the moment, and even Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brisbane has always been underrated as a tourist destination but the hotel chains in Brisbane are looking at occupancy rates of 86 to 90 per cent mid-week at the moment. We need more space. We have had two new hotels come on stream in the last couple of weeks and everything is still full. I just wonder whether there could be some form of deferral of tax, or whether some form of tax holiday could be devised, that would give developers the opportunity to invest in infrastructure such as hotels, as they have in the Asian countries. The influx of development would mean that we would not only have the capacity to service the present market but also have the capacity to service what is going to be a huge market for Australia. In the process, we would create a tremendous number of jobs in the construction industry and in the ancillary industries all the way down the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says to itself, `How the devil can we tax them this time? We need a few more bob, so let's screw this particular industry down a bit tighter because it is successful.' I think the real message is that we have to try to get some sort of balance. Yes, we are going to need programs like this and, yes, I think probably every member in this House is prepared to get behind these programs and try to make them work, but the reality is that those programs can go only so far. What we really must do is have a complete change of attitude from all levels of government so that we just do not get to a situation where we continue to stifle the creation of jobs, whether it be in the tourist industry or any other industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I guess a rule of thumb is whether or not we would see dramatic drops in the number of unemployed around this nation virtually overnight if we all woke up in the morning and said, `We are all going to the parliament today to see if there is some way we can take away some aspect of the red, black or green tape of the bureaucracy and, within balance, try to take off some of these restrictions from industry in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I again offer my congratulations to the member for Lyne for bringing this matter to the notice of the House. Indeed, I thank the House in general for the spirit in which the motion has been debated. There is no doubt that the whole issue of unemployment is still one of the most vital in our community. It is still necessary that the employment opportunities and the difficulties facing especially our young people be exposed at every available opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate, which is an important acknowledgment of the government's very successful Working Nation program, although I guess I will have to start again tomorrow. On the surface, the actual words in the motion of the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), supported by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), are a cause for congratulation. There is obvious concern there for the unemployed in the electorates of those two members. I wish the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee every success in its quest for 1,000 new jobs on Australia's holiday coast. The motion of the member for Lyne, an opposition member, had the possibility of being a breath of fresh air, so unlike that of many of his colleagues on that side of the House. I acknowledge the support of the member for Cowper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House are only too aware that when matters pertaining to employment, education and training are raised in this House they are too frequently met with derisive yawns and apathy, particularly from some members of the frontbench of the coalition, noted for their lack of imagination and meanness of spirit. I assure the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper that the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee, with the support of business and community organisations, can achieve their laudable goal of 1,000 new jobs, with the government's initiatives in Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last quarter of 1994, my own electorate of Port Adelaide embarked on a similar campaign of 1,000 new jobs by Christmas 1994. Port Adelaide, like the electorate of Lyne, has an unacceptable level of unemployment. The CES manager in Port Adelaide, Mr Pat Moylan, who is a breath of fresh air, and I set up a steering committee made up of business, community and sporting organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sporting organisation was none other than South Australia's most famous football club, the Port Adelaide Football Club, of which I am proudly a vice-president, the most successful football club in Australia in any code and an applicant for entry into the AFL in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president of the football club, Mr Greg Boulton, a very prominent businessman, was elected chairperson. The chief executive officer of the Port Adelaide Football Club, Mr Brian Cunningham, played a very prominent role in the committee. The local press, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portside Messenger</EMPHASIS>, also played an important role in reporting the launch and provided weekly reports of how the campaign was progressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), a very keen North Melbourne supporter, managed to venture into the Magpies' den at Alberton Oval and very successfully and enthusiastically launched the campaign. In fact, we displayed the objective of 1,000 jobs by Christmas on the famous Alberton Oval scoreboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign was a success. It boosted the level of job vacancies lodged with the Port Adelaide CES. The campaign more than met its stated goal of 1,000 jobs by Christmas 1994. Unemployed people in Port Adelaide were able to find work in the lead-up to Christmas with both employers and job seekers benefiting from the initiatives in the government's white paper on employment and growth, Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one-thousandth vacancy was filled by Crompton and Sons, a tannery in Wingfield in my electorate. The client was a job compact placement who had been registered as unemployed since 19 January 1982. In fact, this particular person had been on unemployment benefits continuously since 25 March 1988. We celebrated that occasion most appropriately with Mr Gary Jones from Cromptons, invited guests and the very important new employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The involvement of business and the community in the campaign, and the publicity generated, helped raise the profile of DEET in my electorate of Port Adelaide and the initiatives of Working Nation. There is also no doubt that the contribution of the Port Adelaide Football Club was critical to the achievement of the 1,000 jobs target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that in the developed world there is a chronic and endemic unemployment problem. When you analyse the last 40 years, you discover that productivity has quadrupled. We discover that capital investment has almost quadrupled. We discover that energy consumption has tripled. But&mdash;here is the real catch&mdash;the need for labour has increased by only a third. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are different economic orthodoxies around the world that for different reasons appear incapable of solving the unemployment problem. In Europe you find high wages and high unemployment but with a safety net. In the United States you find very low wages and a lower rate of unemployment but without an adequate safety net in a situation which, according to Robert Reich, the US Secretary of Labor, is equally undesirable. Working Nation is uniquely Australian. It rejects the pathways taken by the Europeans and the North Americans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Working Nation, the government has committed itself to reduce the number of unemployed, particularly the number of long-term unemployed. The government committed itself to provide a job offer to all those in the job compact. The government committed itself to introduce individual assistance through competitive case management. The government committed itself to deliver a substantial increase in entry level training places. It needs to be acknowledged that the government is well on track to achieve all of the targets set for these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Working Nation, the nation set a target of reducing unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. Since the release of Working Nation, the rate of unemployment has fallen from a peak of 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. This is a highly significant achievement against a backdrop of increasing participation rates. In the past two years we have seen the creation of 600,000 jobs. Working Nation made the commitment to reduce the number of long-term unemployed people. This was in part through case management and in part through a guaranteed job offer to all long-term unemployed people in the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the economic downturn of the early 1980s, interest rates, inflation and unemployment were all over 10 per cent. I am sure those on the other side well remember that. This guaranteed that the electorate would decisively reject the coalition and its failed policies of the time. In the recovery cycle that followed with a Labor government, only one in seven long-term unemployed gained employment. The ratio has in the current recovery improved dramatically for the long-term unemployed because of the initiatives of Working Nation. The fall has been close to 30 per cent&mdash;a ratio of almost one in three and a huge improvement on the one in seven ratio of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, unemployment numbers have fallen by close to 15 per cent in the last 12 months, as the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) said today. Youth long-term unemployment has fallen by 44 per cent in the 12 months to March this year. The number of newstart allowance recipients has fallen by 12.6 per cent in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget reaffirmed the government's commitment to the goals and targets of Working Nation. There will be substantial increases in funding of labour market programs, with expenditure estimated to increase from the $1.3 billion of the last financial year to $1.9 billion in the next financial year and $2 billion in 1996-97. As the member for Lyne has acknowledged in his motion before the House, the new work opportunities program is the key element of ensuring that the job compact can be delivered to all eligible job seekers, particularly if they live in areas where employment opportunities are limited.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My private member's motion calling for the banning of this worst type of culturally accepted assault was moved in this place on 21 February 1994. At that time I reminded the House that this assault had been practised on females by some ethnic communities for thousands of years to secure their virginity as `maidens' and their faithfulness as wives. It is a traumatic and violent attack on women and little girls which is painful, dangerous, has serious long-term effects and can cause death. A World Health Organisation report released in October last year says that at least two million women and girls are affected each year and that the practice is growing in Australia, Europe and North America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the former New South Wales government and the present South Australian government, both of which have already passed legislation banning female genital mutilation. In South Australia, the legislation was introduced one year and one day following my private member's motion. When speaking to the motion, I also highlighted the need for education. I said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation must be part of the strategy to educate and promote change not only in ethnic communities but also amongst professionals including doctors, midwives, nurses, teachers, social workers, the police and courts and the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no stronger education or message to the international community than specific legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those women who have themselves been mutilated but who are fighting to prevent the same happening to their daughters, it will strengthen their argument with the men or grandmothers of their communities who still firmly believe in the tradition.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that the federal government in the last budget allocated $3.46 million over the next five years towards an education program. It is my understanding that the next meeting of the Attorneys-General will be held in Perth on 14 July. I hope at that meeting Western Australia will announce&mdash;if it has not already done so&mdash;its own intention to join with the other states for a uniform approach. Should that be the case, it will be a reason to acknowledge just what can be achieved on an important human rights issue with a bipartisan approach in this place and then with cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth. </PARA>

As the delegation report which has been tabled in the House indicates, Australia is a strong supporter of the Middle East peace process and has consistently supported a comprehensive regional settlement based on the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue tonight not with joy but with sadness, because I think our nation has a tendency to be carried away with the issues of the moment. I had discussions today with those people in the country who are probably best qualified to understand the native title issue because I was interested to try to catch up on where native title was at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost two years down the track, we find that we have a piece of legislation which is seriously flawed with a no-win situation for all parties. The courts are stymied, the legislators are not able to proceed with the impending election&mdash;particularly in the federal sense&mdash;and the pastoralists live in fear, particularly those who are under claim. Let us just think about how many native title claims have been successful. On mainland Australia, not one. After all the enthusiasm that was shown in December 1993&mdash;in the International Year for the World's Indigenous People&mdash;it is sad for me to report to the parliament that we have not progressed very far at all. </PARA>

It is quite right for Australians to be indignant at the arrogance of these Europeans who are creating and helping to create weapons of mass destruction in our quarter. It is quite right for Australians to be totally incensed by the arrogance of these people. Why? It is not necessarily because they are bombs but because the material that is used creates a thing called radiation. Radiation is vital to life. We know that is to do with the sun, et cetera. We also know, and having been in a family that has suffered at the hands of melanomas, that radiation can also be a major killer.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was dropped by a bloke named Billy McMahon, who saw the economics of it and said, `Jervis Bay'&mdash;which happens to be in my seat&mdash;`is not going to get a nuclear power plant.'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Hinkler)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gladstone is a great city which has been able to forge that elusive balance between industry and environment and between progress and lifestyle. It is the Central Queensland powerhouse of manufacturing at the northern end of my Hinkler electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday marked yet another important milestone for the Gladstone region, because construction of a third potline for the aluminium manufacturer Boyne Smelters Ltd officially commenced. The third potline expansion&mdash;costing $1 billion&mdash;will almost double the production capacity of the smelter from 260,000 tonnes per year to 480,000 tonnes per year by April 1998. When completed Boyne Smelters, which is 50 per cent owned and managed by Comalco on behalf of its other joint venture partners, will be one of the three largest aluminium smelters in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday represented a major achievement for the company, which has had to overcome a number of hurdles in recent years, including a drawn-out sale agreement with the Queensland government over the purchase of the Gladstone power station; uncertainty over bauxite supplies with the lodgment of native title claims over parts of the Weipa mineral reserves; low world aluminium prices; and an uncertain dollar. Despite these hurdles&mdash;and no doubt there are more to come&mdash;the board, management and staff have held their resolve and commitment to push ahead with the smelter and its expansion, and they were the real winners yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The economic impact of a development like Boyne Smelters is very significant to the local, state and national economies. The smelter expansion will add $632 million to the region's economy and $1,095 million to the national economy, as well as $250 million in much needed additional export revenue, given the present parlous state of our overseas payments. Interestingly, Boyne Smelters economic impact was revealed in 1993, before the current expansion. At that time it had paid out over $34 million in wages and salaries, purchased $165 million worth of goods and services from the Gladstone community, spent an additional $56 million with Queensland business and spent a further $154 million with businesses in the remainder of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Boyne Smelters is also an important value adder using both electricity generated from Central Queensland, coal from the Dawson and Callide valleys and alumina refined in Gladstone from Weipa bauxite. Refining increases the value of a tonne of bauxite from $20 per tonne to around $200 per tonne while smelting of alumina to aluminium increases the value from $200 per tonne to around $1,600 per tonne&mdash;in other words, about 80 times the original value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Boyne Smelters currently employs 890 people on a continuous shift basis. That number will grow by a further 700 workers during the two-year construction phase and, on completion, the permanent work force will grow by a further 350 to a total work force of 1,240. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The potline expansion will bring further impetus to the emerging community of Boyne-Tannum to the south of Gladstone and highlights the need for additional government and community services in that area as it continues to grow. Paramount amongst these is the urgent need for a high school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, projects like this do not just occur. They represent company and community commitment. May I extend my congratulations to Leon Davis of CRA, chairman of the company; Terry Palmer, chief executive of Comalco; and the general manager of Boyne Smelters, Brian Bassett, on whose shoulders the heavy project falls. Tribute should also be paid to the former Mayor of Gladstone, the late Col Brown; to the present mayor, Peter Corones, who, in his previous role of Manager of Gladstone Area Promotion Inc., fostered the project; and also to Calliope mayor, Liz Cunningham, in whose shire this extraordinary enterprise has developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I also pay tribute to Trudi Habner who, as the public affairs manager, has forged quality communication links between various tiers of government and the company. This latest expansion will do much to further boost business confidence in the region and open up employment opportunities for local people, especially in a region where nearly 40 per cent of teenagers seeking a job cannot get one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like you, Mr Speaker, I came into this House from local government. I am sad to report to this House that local government in Victoria today is no longer democratic. That local government in Victoria needed reforming is not in dispute. Indeed, the previous Labor government attempted serious changes to local government in Victoria but were defeated, strangely enough, by the Liberal and National parties who were then in opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the usual hypocritical group of people they are, once again in government they immediately amalgamated local government, although unlike the labour movement their amalgamation process was political. They appointed Leonie Bourke, a failed candidate for the Liberal Party in a state seat, as the local government commissioner. Without consultation with any community, they then set about the process of not changing and reforming local government but destroying local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, new boundaries have been established. But the boundaries have been established not by the process of consultation, not by the process of talking to the people who ultimately own local government&mdash;the ratepayers and the citizens of the areas&mdash;but behind closed doors. We have a peculiar situation in Victoria with the new shire of Nillimbic&mdash;which is adjacent to the municipality I served in as a councillor and shire president&mdash;having a rate base now of only $18.5 million. It is a joke. It fails all of the criteria which were established and which recognise the need for local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boundaries that are now being established are political. Very strangely, they follow the boundaries that many state Liberal Party members wanted. The shire of Strathbogie in my electorate is known locally as the McNamara shire. It follows exactly what the Deputy Premier of Victoria wanted. It has a rate base which is so low that anyone who knows local government knows that, very shortly, it will need further change to order to make it a viable economic unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having established that the process itself was purely political, surprise, surprise, we then have people called commissioners appointed to the new bodies. And, surprise, surprise, the bulk of them are members of the Liberal Party. The chief commissioner gets paid $90,000 a year; the two deputy commissioners get paid $60,000 a year. Surprise, surprise, they get provided with a brand new car, mobile phone and embossed cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said that the reason for appointing commissioners was to assist in the transition of the amalgamation process. But now we are told that we will not have local government elections until 1997. Indeed, many commissioners in Victoria are now arguing that, rather than have elections, commissioners should become permanent and we should not have elected local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a Liberal Party democracy. This is what we expect from the hypocrites on the other side when they talk about democracy. When you come to a state like Victoria and see how they practise it, you know there is one thing they are frightened of&mdash;and that is people. The Liberal Party is desperately frightened of ordinary people, frightened of what people think and frightened to have people run their own affairs. The Liberal Party talks about choice. It says that is what it stands for&mdash;that all individuals have choice&mdash;but it practises the opposite. In Victoria it is demonstrable, it is alarming and it is disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Nillimbic, for example, local community groups who set up watchdog bodies are refused total access to the commissioners. We are told that the commissioners are going to cut 20 per cent off the rates. So we are all going to get cheap rates. In the shire of Mitcham, what have they done? Guess who got the sack? Outdoor staff. Not the people behind the desks. No, they still sit there. They inherited five executive officers and they still have five executive officers. Who went? The outdoor staff, the lower paid, the people who have no defences in rural areas where unemployment is already high and severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse than that, the commissioners then go and change the by-laws. These are people who do not live in the municipalities. They are from outside the municipalities. They are people who take their directions not from the people who pay their wages but from Mr Hallam and the state government. This is Liberal Party democracy. When people complain and say, `We want to be heard, we live here, this is our council,' they are denied access to the commissioners. Local government in Victoria is now a joke.

Colleagues will remember that, for the last two years, I have brought to Canberra the winner of an essay writing competition for secondary school students, who were invited to write a 2,000-word essay on a set topic. This year's topic was: `Australia's future as a prosperous multicultural society depends on the development of a new national ethos.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to congratulate Quenton Peake of Woodvale, a year 12 student from Kingsway Christian College, on his winning entry. He spent last week here with me as part of his prize. This year's essay topic is particularly relevant in this period where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government have announced their preferred republic model for Australia. The Prime Minister might be interested in what a young person has to say about Australian society. Quenton starts his analysis of Australian society by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference to traditional Australia and the distinguishing spirit which embodied the population conjures images of survivors, people who would continue struggling against the elements. National pride resides with explorers, pioneers and those who fought for Australia's independence, providing the romantic yet tragic picture of those at Gallipoli who were willing to die for their mates. On these qualities has Australia been built and to the courage and personality of previous populations we owe our modern lifestyle as we know it. Success and prosperity has been achieved through not simply the battlers, but their unifying distinctive disposition which forces future generations to acknowledge the presence of, and benefits of emulating such traits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of a changing society, resulting alterations to ethics and standards, and new international directions, one significant aspect of Australia's population is multiculturalism and the continuing expansion of this trend. This raises intriguing issues such as whether the traditional Australian ethos still exists and functions in a modern urban, multicultural society, whether the state of our society dictates the need for a reviewed and updated ethos or whether the individual successfully contributes to the nation's prosperity without the need for a linking characteristic between races, religions and cultures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be said that debate is better the second time around. This reminds me of the song `Love is wonderful the second time around'. The genesis of this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review</EMPHASIS>, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure goes back to the report titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: Bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>, which was presented to the House on 28 October 1993. As a result of this report, there were fundamental changes made in the way the House of Representatives operates. Those changes were contentious at the time they were made, and to many members of the House those changes are still contentious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main argument usually centres around the issue of question time and the way question time is conducted. Opposition members generally say that they do not get a fair go from the government. The government says that the opposition gets the sort of go it deserves, given its behaviour in the House&mdash;that if time is wasted in the House, the opposition will not get the questions that it is entitled to under the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the changes which have occurred in the House since we moved here in 1988, people such as me observe that debate has undoubtedly changed. The chamber is different. Even last night in the House, questions were being raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) regarding the difficulty faced by all members in being heard, due to the acoustic systems and the sheer size of the chamber itself. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I miss the old chamber in the old house. It was a much better debating chamber. We were closer to our adversaries in political debate and the interchange between members in the course of debate was more fluid and more witty. The house itself operated without the need for artificial acoustic or artificial sound producing devices. It was truly a debating chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that many of these changes that we are now talking about which have occurred since 1988 are very largely a result of the changed nature of the chamber, and the difficulty that people have in expressing their political views in the course of debate. I do not envy Mr Speaker or you, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you take the chair in the House&mdash;or indeed any person who takes the chair there. In my observation of the changes I have seen, it is increasingly difficult to maintain any degree of control in the main chamber of the House of Representatives. Again, that is very largely the nature of the chamber itself, the difficulty of hearing and, quite often, the background noise levels that are operating there whilst debate is being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to say that, in politics today, political parties use the forms of the House to either embarrass or bring into disorder government functions and operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The right honourable member for New England smiles at me gently and says, `Get away with you,' or words to that effect. It is a truism. There is no better practitioner of the art of politics than the member for New England. I say to him, as I have said to him privately, that I often wonder why he sits on the back bench when there is no more skilled parliamentary performer, in terms of procedure and disruption, in this House. It may be that from the government's viewpoint it is wise to ensure that he stays on the back bench and does not lend his unarguable experience and talent to the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time is undoubtedly the time that most procedural reports focus on. That is where most anger and attention is drawn. Question time is a procedure which is evolving. It is a procedure which, from the early days of the Westminster system, was an evolving thing. In the early days of the English parliament there was no formalised question time at all. It was a practice which evolved over many years. In the House of Representatives in Australia, question time came about by the Standing Orders Committee of the House, in 1902, 1903 and 1905, establishing the framework in which question time operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's view is that the present system gives a further operational time frame and further examination. I can understand the view of an opposition, hungry and anxious to bring the government to account in a critical sense in the House of Representatives but being frustrated by the present system, whereby many members of the government, particularly the executive, are not present in the House during question time. I can imagine myself on the other side having a particular need to attack a member of the government but being frustrated by the fact that that member is not there. However, it is also true to say that honourable members have an entitlement to question ministers in a very short space of time the following day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened with interest to many arguments put by members of the opposition that the Prime Minister should be in the House on a daily basis. It has often puzzled me why the opposition would want that. In my experience, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is one of the great weapons of the government. I am quite sure that, if the Prime Minister were in the House on a daily basis, the opposition would get to a stage of not wanting to ask any questions because of the capacity that the Prime Minister has to devastate the opposition so readily and so capably and ably in the course of question time. I would have thought that the opposition would be much happier to have the Prime Minister in on only two days a week, when he does not do so much damage to the opposition in a critical sense, rather than insisting on the Prime Minister coming in on a daily basis. That is a personal perspective, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt honourable members on the other side would say that, if the Prime Minister were in on a daily basis, their debating skills would be such that they would devastate the Prime Minister and, particularly, embarrass the government. I have been watching in this place for a long while and I have not seen it happen yet. I have severe doubts whether there is anyone in this House who has the capacity during question time to cause embarrassment to the government by attacking the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a point I want to make about question time which is my personal view. As a politician I get annoyed at the fact that people in the general community have a rather dim view of me as a person of my calling and of my activities as an elected representative of the Australian parliament. I have found, in the relatively short space of time I have been a member of this House, that that view is growing. It does annoy me: I know that it is not true, certainly from my own perspective, and when I look at other members of this House that I know, I know that they are dedicated people. They have particular views which I may disagree with but which nevertheless they hold dearly. They are here because of those views and they are here to represent their particular viewpoint and their constituents in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My annoyance on that is compounded when I watch the conduct of the House during question time. All of us are responsible for the way we are viewed by the general community. Members of the general community, as we generally know, view the proceedings of this place generally only at question time. They have a very poor understanding of the role of parliamentarians in committees and debate in general times. The media&mdash;television, particularly&mdash;focus in on that very short part of the day's activities called question time, when the focus is on personal debate. That is all they see. I think sometimes that honourable members on both sides could remember the focus of television, particularly, on the behaviour of honourable members during question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often smile to myself during question time when points of order are raised referring to standing order 145, on relevance. If there was ever a useless point of order, or a point of order which honourable members should understand is not applicable during question time, that is one. Yet simply by raising standing order 145 as a point of order during question time they bring the House into disrepute. They create the disturbance which television shows so adequately and which brings all honourable members into disrepute. I think sometimes that there really should be an introduction course for honourable members in this place so they understand clearly what 145 means and what points of order relevant to 145 really mean. They would then not bring the House into so much disrepute by asking irrelevant points of order, claiming that 145 is applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern is the fact that members of parliament are seen by the general public as not being serious and as being irrelevant. The House is not seen as being a serious chamber and we are all largely responsible for the way in which the public sees us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the changes to question time have been deleterious to the opposition. I have indicated that, if I were a member of the opposition, the last person I would want in the House every day is the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the member who is interjecting were on the front bench and could use his undoubted forensic skills, what he says might be applicable. However, with the current front bench of the opposition, it is very hard to get one or two of them to ask a reasonable question which could cause any damage to the government, so I am not too sure about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why members who have been in the parliament for a long while and who make a tradition of question time express strong views about question time. What will the opposition do if it ever gets government in this country? Will the members of the opposition change the standing orders in that case? If the executive were composed of opposition members and it had to contend with the current pressures of government&mdash;it is becoming much harder every year&mdash;would the opposition want its ministers to spend as much time in the House of Representatives as was required under the old rules? Would the opposition want to change the current standing orders or are most of the attacks by the opposition purely political in order to suggest that the government is frightened of having its ministers in the House during question time? It would be interesting to know if the opposition has a policy as to what it would do were it the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the member who interjected, the opposition often says such things, but, of course, members on both sides of the House know that what is said in opposition for political purposes and what is done in government are historically different things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you saying `my very word' again? We have got two going for this one; we will go for three if we are lucky. As I have already said, I have my doubts that the opposition would change the current standing orders. All in all, I welcome both reports of the Procedure Committee, including, of course, the specific report on question time in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge members to ensure that they understand the current forms of the House and the current standing orders, and I urge members not to waste the time of the House with spurious and unnecessary points of order during question time. I ask members who do so not to use the procedures for misrepresentation in order to debate. Some members of the House forget that they are responsible for bringing the House into disrepute when they breach current standing orders and yet happily accuse other members of abusing standing orders. One of the most abused procedures of the House is the procedure whereby members can claim to have been misrepresented. Members on this side know that the Leader of the Opposition constantly uses this procedure as a debating tool in the parliament. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is in breach of the standing orders when he does so. I urge members to stand down when Mr Speaker suggests that they do so, instead of ignoring the chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behaviour in the House is in the control of members. No matter what we do with the reports of the Procedure Committee and no matter how we change standing orders, ultimately members on both sides will be judged as people and as politicians by the way they perform irrespective of what standing orders say. Members can debate and members can change standing orders so that every minister comes into the House, but if, during question time, people continue to behave the way they are, the public will judge members accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe any changes to the standing orders are necessary because the current system has proved to be successful and this chamber has proved to be successful. This chamber provides another forum for members of the House to spend time debating non-contentious issues. I am sure that my good friend the honourable member for New England will say that this is a contentious issue rather than a non-contentious issue. Nevertheless, the procedures are operating and the reports of the Procedure Committee simply verify the view of the government that the current system is successful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that we have a debate on standing orders, and I commend the Procedure Committee for the successive papers it has produced. It does not mean that all of us necessarily agree with everything in the papers, but it is true that a leader of the House tends to concentrate far more on the processing and procedures related to the passage of government legislation than on giving adequate opportunity to members to debate legislation and those matters which are a priority to them. The Procedure Committee has certainly increased the opportunity for consideration of the degree to which standing orders facilitate members' performance, and that is important. Members having an input into the way in which the parliament is run is for the good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is appropriate that we have a discussion from time to time about each change as it is made. I for one am not as committed as the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) to the efficacy of this place. I am afraid I tend to be a bit of a traditionalist. I think it is very sad that the parliament has been eroded. It is not erosion in relation to the executive that I am talking about; it is erosion of a forum where genuine debate can be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that a couple of these recommendations are intended to address some of the areas to which attention needs to be paid. For example, I believe ministers must be there to deliver their second reading speech; I believe ministers must be there to sum up; I believe ministers should be there to present amendments; and I think they have to treat the parliamentary debate as an extension of their own responsibilities and not one to be delegated just to a parliamentary secretary. Whatever the advantages of parliamentary secretaries, the minister who is responsible for legislation should at least give courtesy to those who have done some work on particular legislation and are concerned about the effect of legislation, and by being there help to encourage better debate on the text of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had far too many occasions when there have been necessary changes to legislation because of inadequate debate. It is important to divorce the political process from the legislative process&mdash;they inevitably become intertwined&mdash;but it is important that whatever legislation is passed by parliament is effective, accurate and takes into account the impact it will have on the Australian electorate and on the Australian people at large&mdash;those who are not electors. Unless we do that properly, it is we who fail in our job. Quite often, because the minister is not there and does not hear the debate, the debate is less than effective. It is necessary that we address that, and some of the modifications suggested in this legislation, particularly regarding the attendance of ministers, need to be addressed by ministers themselves. I would be quite happy for changes to our standing orders to be addressed in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to another concern: the more changes that are made to standing orders, the more difficult it becomes to understand them. As Leader of the House, I found it more appropriate to introduce what we call sessional orders as distinct from standing orders. The advantage of those is not to in any way lessen their impact on the parliament or the way in which they are applied but sessional orders can apply until a stage is reached when it is felt that they are exactly correct, at which point they can be introduced into standing orders. By changing the standing orders all the time, it is a bit like the tax act: one has to go through so many changes to try and work out what the original form was that one is not sure. In some instances, we do better to test our changes, as indeed this report suggests we are now doing, and have sessional orders which modify the operation; and then when accepted as the desirable form they can become part of the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing orders should be ongoing. I notice that there are a few recommendations in this report and we have had a few modifications in the past which in part are now being revised. If they had been sessional orders we would not have got to the position of having to look upon the amendments on the amendments on the amendments; we would have a sessional order which is seen as temporary until it is written into legislation. I make that suggestion for this discussion paper, which I commend the Procedure Committee on being about to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that worries me is the status of this Main Committee. I said that I am a complete devotee of the parliament and I want to try to get better debate there, but I will come back to the parliament in a moment. I am glad to see the committee has before it the question of whether attendance here is attendance at the parliament. I found it in this session quite incredible that we were debating the appropriations bill in a parliamentary Main Committee which does not entitle members to attendance&mdash;forgetting the allowance bit of it&mdash;and members are not registered as attending parliament if they attend here. That meant that we were discussing the very substance of the difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate in a committee which is not the parliament. I find that just unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to discuss the appropriation bills in the Main Committee, it means we must be attending parliament, because it is only in the House of Representatives that we can deal with financial matters. If it is only in the parliament that we can deal with financial matters, how the devil can they be discussed here, if we are not part of the parliament and if we are not attending parliament when we attend here? That is a mere anomaly, but it is one that needs to be identified, addressed and understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the procedures in the Main Committee are concerned, they do give members a greater opportunity to talk, and that is good. Demonstrably, the audience is a little more intimate, and that is one of the advantages of the Main Committee. It is for that reason that&mdash;come the revolution and the change of government, which I anticipate will occur fairly soon&mdash;there are a few things that we need to seriously address. Putting politics aside, I would hope that the Procedure Committee might consider identifying those matters, if only to give them a trial. I am prepared to accept that it might only be on a sessional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that I would like to do is draw the two sides of the parliament together. I know that the layout of the parliament was decided, for all sorts of reasons such as that we wanted to have more people, but I would like to see the two sides drawn closer together. We are closer together here. We talk because we can see each other. It was apropos of that point that I spoke about the acoustics of the main chamber yesterday. I find it quite ridiculous that you cannot hear what is going on there half the time. The acoustics are brilliant when there is nobody in the room, but fill it with a group of people and you cannot hear anything! Yet it is when the parliament is full, and when everybody is seated and there are a few speakers having an interchange, that we really need to know what is going on; but it is then that we cannot.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another very real diplomatic reason that this is desirable: far too few of them have a democracy such as ours. If we bring them onto the floor of our parliament, they might well understand that, for all that we have adversarial dialogue from time to time, it is a process which enables the proper expression of individual points of view, irrespective of what those views might be, and that it is that which is really the hallmark of our democracy. I am getting diverted, as I wanted to say a few things about a couple of other items in the report, but I do recommend that, in the discussion paper, some time be spent on looking at a trial of a different way to make parliament a little more workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of observations about these changes to standing orders, and I have said that I think they ought to be sessional. I have made a couple of comments on occasions about the importance of the minister's second reading speech being available when the bill itself is presented. It is more and more important today because the High Court has decided that the minister's second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum should be taken into account when determining the application of law. Therefore, we need to have the minister's second reading speech available to determine the degree and the character of the legislation and the nuances behind it. I think that recommendation 3.3 certainly needs to be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue raises with me the question of whether the first reading procedure is necessary. I would be more inclined to adopt a procedure which said that at the time the first reading is made the first reading speech should be what is now said to be the minister's second reading speech. We have that formality now but there is no need for that first reading, if we get rid of the reason to have it. We need a third reading because that is dealing with the bill as a whole. We need at least two readings but, in my view, we could happily get away with a first reading that presented the minister's second reading speech as we now know it and then a second reading which would be the bill being dealt with as a whole. In that way, the second reading would become the first reading and the third reading would become the second reading. I think that would be a more sensible process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we would still deal with it in committee. I am not committed to the idea of the Speaker still sitting up on the top chair for the committee process. I confess to preferring the greater intimacy of having the Speaker speak from the floor. Members addressing a public meeting do not want to sit up the front in a daze: they want to get down amongst the people and get close to them. They need to get down amongst the people so that everyone feels they are part of it. That is how the committee process should be and I would like to see more of that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I just wanted to say a couple of brief things. Paragraph 9.3.6 on page 35 says that question time should commence at 2.30. I think that should be accepted by the government. I think it is mad having it at 3 o'clock; it is too late in the afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that no change be made to the sitting hours of the House.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that not having meals is stupid. Part of the purpose of changing the sitting hours was to try to allow people to have some reasonable time at night. I regularly go through without lunch and without dinner. At times, I get invitations to three or four of each but that is not the point. We badly need to have time within which we can have committee meetings without interruption, particularly because the standing orders of the Senate prevent all the joint committees meeting while the other house is sitting. If we had at least an hour at dinner and an hour at lunch, for many, it would mean people could get some exercise. There are variants we can introduce to obtain that. I certainly do not accept that our present sitting hours are preferable. I would like to see formalised breaks so that people can either eat if they wish or conduct some of the other functions which are an essential part of parliamentary life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 55 seconds that I have left, I want to say something about questions. I do not agree with the idea of having ministers rostered on. I think it is better for them all to be there. The statistics mean absolutely nothing. The way questions run depends on the issues. To my mind, structured questions from either side are far worse than rostered ministers. I would prefer to see at least half the questions on each occasion, certainly, from the opposition, without restraint and without discipline. I think it is far better for members to have an opportunity to ask questions on matters that are of moment to them. I have real doubts about the question time procedure as it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked an opportunity to say more on this matter. In this report, I think question time remains very much open to review. I do not agree with it as it is running now. I commend the analysis in paragraph 6.1.2 on page 20, which does, in fact, set down many of the issues. I commend the committee and look forward to reading the general review which I gather is to be produced some time in the next parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of minutes, something else attracted me. It was the first thing I had written in my sketchy notes in preparation for this speech on the review of the sitting times of the House. It struck me that, in creating what are thought to be more civilised times of sitting, the notion not to have any meal breaks seems a little silly. I say that not only in respect of members but also in respect of all those people who work in support of our operations. It is a very difficult juggling task to roster people through meal breaks and I cannot understand why there is no break at least for lunch or dinner, in recognition of the efforts of the support people, just for the sake of sitting through and finishing at 9 o'clock or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the new hours have worked well because they have created those early nights. But, whilst I am a great supporter of this chamber and whilst I think it is of great value to the workings of the parliament, it has added to our frenetic pace. This was illustrated this morning when there was a division in the main chamber. The proceedings of the Main Committee were suspended while we all went to the division and then we all traipsed back here. Members are often trying to keep an eye on what is happening in the main chamber because they have an interest in both places, and that is difficult. One of the things that characterises this place for me is the breathless arrival of members as they scurry from their involvement downstairs to participate upstairs in the Main Committee. The frenetic pace has resulted in dual responsibilities for a lot of people&mdash;not only for members but also for clerks, attendants, Hansard and a whole host of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I want to thank two people: the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who is here in the chamber, and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). They have to take a dual role within their party because of its size: not only are they members of the Speaker's panel but also they are National Party whips for the coalition. They undertake their role in this place with great diligence. I appreciate that they have quite an immense juggling act to ensure that their time is spread over both those roles. I think it should be placed on record that there are people who appreciate their efforts and their cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in the report about the way in which legislation is dealt with. Some of those matters are worthy of discussion and comment. It is, on balance, difficult to know whether or not the second reading speech should be made at the time of presentation of the bill. I agree with the conclusion reached by the committee that we should go back to the old system. It is helpful in preparation for the debate for members to know what the minister or parliamentary secretary who has carriage of the legislation has said in support of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there would be some difficulties and that it would require some changes in standing orders to get that legislation into the Main Committee. That might also lead to coalition spokespeople in portfolio areas querying whether they should have the same opportunity to give their second reading speech in the same chamber as the minister or parliamentary secretary. They are issues that the committee has talked through. They are issues that, quite appropriately, are matters for further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also highlights in tabular form how often the appropriate minister or the appropriate parliamentary secretary takes carriage of his or her legislation. This is an important aspect which is worthy of critical analysis by both sides&mdash;and it has attracted comments from both sides of the chamber. On behalf of executive government, those who have direct responsibility for legislation should take a particular interest in that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only should they present the second reading speech, but they should also have carriage of the wrapping up of the debate, especially consideration in detail. They should take carriage of and responsibility for amendments that are made at that stage. That is a basic responsibility that those who act on behalf of the executive should undertake. I have no problem with whether it is the senior minister, junior minister or parliamentary secretary, as long as it is a person who has responsibility within the portfolio area of the legislation which is being presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many individual ministers and parliamentary secretaries who take those duties very seriously and who, without fail, try to do the right thing by the House of Representatives. However, it was quite correct for the committee to highlight that. I hope the executive government can see fit to make the appropriate arrangements to ensure that, wherever possible, the responsible person is in either the Main Committee or the main chamber to take carriage of the legislation. Having said that, members acknowledge that those people have other responsibilities. However, like ordinary backbench members and people who have other positions within the House, they need to juggle their time to ensure that those responsibilities are covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended that ways should be investigated to encourage visitors to parliament to observe the proceedings of the Main Committee. That is something that has troubled me from time to time. I was unsure what information was being provided to visitors to Parliament House about the operations of the Main Committee. I am told that the Main Committee is mentioned in the pamphlet on the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some signage which indicates where the Main Committee is being held. From time to time, people find themselves observing what is going on here. Perhaps we should consider producing a brochure, pamphlet or handout that more fully explains how this chamber operates, and explains the difference between it and the main chamber. That would include such things as how members are allocated positions in the main chamber, whereas members in the Main Committee are able to speak from whatever position they like. I think that those differences need to be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole I think, as other contributors to this debate have indicated, this Main Committee has been an outstanding success. It has opened up the amount of time that has been made available to members to debate important issues. It is not only legislation which after agreement between the coalition and the government is called non-controversial which comes up here for debate. I stress again that to say the legislation is non-controversial is not to say that the debate cannot be controversial; it is just the nature of the legislation that gives the definition. The loose definition means that the legislation should not be required to come to a vote; that is the important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming advantage that this Main Committee has given is our ability to speak to reports like the one that is before the Committee at the moment. It must be bordering on a dozen members who have been able to come up here and make quite full contributions in response to this well crafted report. Later today we will have the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on Lake Pedder debated more fully than would have been possible for us if we had relied upon the main chamber. That has been the great advantage of having this additional debating time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been comments about the lack of atmosphere in this room. That is something that will slowly but surely develop. Let me say, on behalf of the presiding officers and the clerks, that we are always open to suggestions about what we can do to improve the environs of this room. Comment has been made throughout this debate that there is a different style of debate coming about because of the intimacy of this place. I think that is good. That is an advantage. For those who have a knowledge of Australian rules, it is akin to the atmosphere at a game out at the AFL ground at Waverley Park, where it was thought that pushing back the spectators and giving a large space around the boundaries would be an advantage. This has been something that has been rejected by those who follow that code. They prefer to go to grounds like the MCG, where the boundaries have remained the traditional distance from the action and people can feel more involved. To a certain extent I think we have that sort of atmosphere down in the larger chamber. There have been suggestions made about how we can perhaps get around that. There has also been the debate about visitors going into the chamber, and the security implications and things like that. Perhaps we just have to revisit those continually to see what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give a warning that, even though we are at a close distance, the debate must always be carried on through the chair. Because of the smaller distances between the sides of the chamber here, greater debate can be encouraged; and we should not see, as we continue to see down in the main chamber, set pieces made. Members come in, make their set speeches and trot out; and then others come in and make speeches that do not relate to what is happening around them. I think that that is a sad thing, and I think that we should do everything to encourage people to enter into debate, interchange and discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of months back, whilst the Speaker was away, I had duties as Acting Speaker, and I received a note of encouragement from a former speaker of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, Ken Coghill, who indicated a wish that we could encourage members to understand the importance of addressing their remarks through the chair. I know that when you are an occupant of the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you are very strict on that. Dr Coghill believed that, if we were even more strict on that, it would take the heat out of the debate. When there is a continual `You did this, you did that' across the chamber it becomes very personalised, and through this simple step we give a bit of space. </PARA>

Perhaps there could be variations on the rostering&mdash;it could be that the Prime Minister could be encouraged to attend three times out of four. I am not particularly wedded to the balance that there is at the moment. But I believe the rostering has enabled junior ministers to be put on notice that they cannot hide behind other ministers being there at question time and I think that is an improvement. On the whole, I am encouraged that there has been this great discussion on the procedures that were instituted during last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I tabled the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder</EMPHASIS>, in the House on Monday, I briefly referred to the committee's main conclusions. Today I want to speak in more detail about some of the committee's findings. Before I do, I would like to briefly comment on misleading remarks by the Tasmanian Premier and others about the cost of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian Premier apparently said on Monday that the inquiry had cost about $1 million. As far as we have been able to estimate, the cost was about $60,000. It may have been that the Hydro-Electric Commission in Tasmania spent quite a lot of money in preparing its evidence, but that is not part of the cost of the inquiry. The cost of the inquiry itself was the cost of the staff time, the travel of members, the printing of the report and the conduct of hearings, and our best estimate of that is $60,000. I think it is important to correct that misjudgment that the Tasmanian Premier made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to begin my comments on the committee's findings by elaborating on our conclusion that it would be inappropriate to allocate resources to the further consideration of the proposal to restore Lake Pedder. This view was based on two basic observations: first, that further  consideration would involve some costs; and, second, that there are other, more important environmental programs and goals that warrant higher priority. The likely costs which would be incurred if the proposal was implemented were a controversial and strongly contested issue. We were not able to make a definitive estimate ourselves, but came to the view that it is likely that there would be significant long-term costs if the proposal were to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we look only at the option of further consideration of the proposal, it is clear that considerable planning, research, monitoring and the preparation of a thorough environmental impact assessment would be required before a commitment could be made to proceed. This work alone would be quite costly. It would not be worth allocating resources to such tasks unless there was a real likelihood that the proposal would attract the necessary level of support. But, more importantly, it would only be appropriate to allocate resources if we were sure that other projects and goals were adequately funded. This is clearly not the case at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that there is already a backlog of important works in the World Heritage area and that funding for these and some other projects is inadequate. I am concerned that funding an environmental impact statement, for example, would make it less likely that some of the other projects required in the World Heritage areas could be funded. Some of those in favour of the Lake Pedder restoration proposal argued that the committee not be distracted by the question of priorities. But the reality for all governments is that there is a need to allocate funds to a range of competing expenditure proposals and there are never sufficient funds to adequately implement all of even the most worthwhile or urgent projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possible allocation of resources to the Lake Pedder proposal would have to be considered in a broad, national context. This would go beyond the question of its relative priority in the allocation of funds to the management of the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area. The need to take a wider perspective is most apparent if one looks at the long-term potential for both the state and the Commonwealth governments to be committed to an expensive and open-ended program to rehabilitate the drained area or compensate for the loss of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, these costs were strongly disputed in the evidence and the committee was unable to make a definitive estimate of what the cost might be. Much would depend on questions that are not yet resolved. The future of Comalco at Bell Bay, for example, would be significant to the valuation of potential electricity generation. It is fair to say that many members of the committee were somewhat sceptical of the cost estimates presented by the Tasmanian government and the Hydro-Electric Commission but, by the same token, the estimates of either little cost or a positive benefit presented by those in favour of the proposal were also received with some scepticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that one possibility is that the cost would run to hundreds of millions of dollars. This is a significant figure if we look at some other environmental programs and goals. In 1992, this committee reported on the role of protected areas in biodiversity. We found that there was an urgent need to complete the range of representative reserves to ensure that all ecosystem types are adequately protected around the country. The committee made several recommendations that would require funding. The most significant of these was the provision by the Commonwealth of $100 million over six years to establish a tied grants program specifically for the purpose of acquiring identified areas to be included in a nationwide system of ecologically representative core protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I appreciate the recent efforts of the government in finding funds in the budget for a national biodiversity strategy, I remain disappointed that the funding is inadequate compared to the need identified by the committee. There is no doubt in my mind that a fully funded national biodiversity strategy has a much higher priority than the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder. I personally could not support allocating funds to the Lake Pedder proposal while the biodiversity strategy remains so seriously under-funded. Other environmental and conservation programs that one could think of involve a measure of some urgency, where there is often a need to intervene before the situation gets worse or more damage is done. The landcare and tree planting programs are particularly good examples of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christine Milne, the leader of the Tasmanian Greens, explained to the committee why consideration of priorities could lead the committee to undervalue the Lake Pedder proposal but, in so doing, she referred to the need to respond to immediate issues. I find that this is one of the difficulties that arise in supporting the proposal. Mrs Milne said that in the short term she was constantly engaged in issues where destruction was imminent, and she mentioned the European carp infestation of Tasmanian lakes and dieback in the central highlands of Tasmania as examples of what she described as immediate issues. Other witnesses also listed those two high priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lake Pedder proposal is not urgent in this sense. There is no damage being done and no need for immediate remedial intervention. It was quite clear that, after nearly 25 years of inundation, the features that are most important to the restoration proposal remain preserved under the waters of the current Lake Pedder and are likely to remain intact for some time to come. Draining the current lake would allow these features to be observed and appreciated. I believe that, if practical, this could be worth while because it would enhance the World Heritage values of the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed by the evidence of Dr Kevin Kiernan, who clearly showed the importance of the unique geomorphological features associated with the original Lake Pedder. Dr Kiernan introduced the committee to the concept of geoconservation. In my mind, this reinforced the view that the decision to flood Lake Pedder was wrong and it also emphasised the importance of the area as World Heritage. From what Dr Kiernan told us, I consider that the geomorphological features associated with the original lake would be significant aspects of the world's natural heritage. We are indebted to Dr Kiernan for raising this issue and to Professor Tyler for showing that these features have not been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Lake Pedder also has significant and important values. I said at the time of the committee's visit to the lake that is a magnificent lake, and I remain of that view. It has great scenic attraction, it is an important trout fishery and it is a beautiful place to visit. But none of these characteristics are of World Heritage significance. It appears that the current Lake Pedder was included in the World Heritage area mainly for administrative and management purposes rather than for any addition it might make to the World Heritage values of the area. I disagree with those who suggested to the committee that the loss of the current Lake Pedder would diminish the World Heritage values of the area. The argument that draining the lake would be contrary to the provisions of the World Heritage convention was wrong in law and seriously misinterpreted the convention. It was also wrong in its evaluation of World Heritage features. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sympathetic to those who appreciate Lake Pedder in its current form but they are wrong if they suggest that the original lake did not possess significant World Heritage values or that the World Heritage value of the current lake exceeds that of the original. However, it cannot be said that restoring Lake Pedder is necessary to protect World Heritage values, nor is there a conservation or environmental imperative for restoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one matter related to World Heritage about which I would agree with those who are opposed to draining the lake. It is not necessary, nor would it be possible, to completely restore Lake Pedder and its surrounds to their pre-flooding condition. However, we should not underestimate the capacity of nature to regenerate itself. Earlier this year, I read a very interesting autobiography by Professor Edward Wilson, who is a noted ecologist, in fact a global leader of the ecological profession. He had done experiments with tiny islands, completely removing life forms from them, and had then observed how quickly life forms, plant forms, insects, birds and so on had re-established themselves on those tiny islands. He found very rapid regeneration within a year and almost complete regeneration within a few years. That is a different situation, of course, from draining a lake and looking for recovery but it does give some indication of the capacity of nature to regenerate very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draining and restoring Lake Pedder would attract considerable international interest. I believe that, if it proceeded smoothly and reasonably quickly, the efforts of the Tasmanian and the Australian communities would be much appreciated internationally. However, I do not believe that the world community would patiently withhold its condemnation if the rehabilitation process failed. There would be an expectation, one which the Australian community would share with the world, that we would then undertake a major restoration effort to protect the World Heritage values. That, of course, could be quite costly. The prospects for successfully rehabilitating the whole area, not just the original Lake Pedder itself, and for protecting the World Heritage values in the long term are questions that would need to be answered before the proposal could proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to refer to the evidence relating to the platypus population in the current lake. I understand that at least one article in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> has recently suggested that the evidence presented by Professor Forteath left the committee with no option but to oppose the proposal. This, as would be clear from our report, was not the case. It was perhaps unfortunate that Professor Forteath appeared at the public hearing in Hobart without first either making a written submission or presenting his credentials. We did not have an opportunity to consider his observation nor were we in a position to evaluate his standing as a potential expert witness before he appeared at the hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the hearing, we sought the views of the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and we also received a submission from an acknowledged expert in platypus ecology. We became quite sceptical about Professor Forteath's evidence and do not regard him to be an expert in platypus population sampling. We note that, as he later made clear to the committee, his estimates of the Lake Pedder platypus population were based on casual field observations made while he was trout fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provided some information about the population but it did not amount to a rigorous, scientifically sound sampling methodology. However, as noted by the committee in its report, it was the only evidence available about the platypus population in the current Lake Pedder. It would have been better if Professor Forteath had explained at the public hearing that he was not an expert on platypus populations, that he had not scientifically sampled the population and that he had a particular interest in the retention of the lake. Despite these oversights, Professor Forteath's evidence was of some value because it raised a possible implication of the proposal that might otherwise have been overlooked. His concerns can be extrapolated beyond the platypus population to the possible fate of other species present in the current lake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Lake Pedder proposal, I am more concerned about endangered species such as the Pedder galaxias than the platypus. The general point that Professor Forteath raised is another one of the questions that would have to be carefully and thoroughly addressed if the proposal were to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to flood the lake was taken against a background of ignorance and shameful disregard of the biology of the original lake. We should not allow a similar mistake to be made in any hastily arrived at decision to now drain it. The question of the populations of plants and animals in the lake highlights the need for some very serious questions to be addressed if the proposal were to proceed. It is our firm conclusion that allocating resources to answer these questions is inappropriate while there are other higher priority and more urgent matters to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by dealing with the suggestion that the committee has `squibbed out' by not supporting the restoration proposal. It would have been very easy for us to avoid the issue by recommending that further research be carried out. Instead, the committee came to a considered conclusion, based on the evidence, and we had the conviction to stand by that conclusion. I believe it is an authoritative conclusion. We have presented a report that we knew in advance would be criticised by those who would disagree with our findings, but it is a report that we believe is the most responsible and appropriate answer to the restoration proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the honourable member will have something else to say. We were almost unanimous in this report. I suppose being almost unanimous is like being slightly pregnant but 11 out of 12 is not bad. I came into this particular inquiry very much looking forward to it. I joined the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and Arts because of my particular interest in the environment, only to be embroiled within weeks of joining the committee with the so-called sports rorts affair. I had the impression then that this was going to be a thoroughly unpleasant experience. However, apart from that one aberration, it has been a most delightful and interesting committee to work on. No inquiry, or anything that we have been involved in, have I found more interesting than the inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into the inquiry with the view that the lake probably should be drained and that is a view that I had held for a long time. Many, many moons ago, when I was a much younger man, I was of the opinion&mdash;as were so many other Australians at that time&mdash;that it should not be flooded. I suppose I had kept that view in the back of my mind for all of these years, so when this inquiry was called I thought, `Good, we will be able to have a thorough, decent inquiry into this and, at the end of it, recommend that we drain the lake.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have attended all but one of the public hearings where we have taken evidence and what have you. I visited Tasmania twice with the committee. The committee spent an entire day at Lake Pedder. Having listened to everything that everyone had to say, and considered it long and hard, I came to the conclusion, as did the majority of the committee&mdash;11 out of 12&mdash;that it was not on, that we would have to recommend against the draining of Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of things were of a particular concern to me. When we viewed the lake, I, like the chairman, was most impressed by the beauty of the current Lake Pedder. I thought it was one of the most magnificent sights that I had seen in my life. No doubt the original Lake Pedder was also a magnificent sight. I was amazed at the cliffs, and at the beaches that had formed around the perimeter of the current lake. I am talking about some hundreds of kilometres. One of my primary concerns, when considering whether the restoration of Lake Pedder should go ahead, was with the scarring and with beaches hundreds of feet up the sides of mountains. Some people said, when giving evidence, that that would sort itself out over time, but I thought that there would be a massive cost involved and I could not be convinced that that would be satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also took into account the feelings of the people of Tasmania. When we were in Hobart to hear evidence, and during one of our lunch recesses, I spent some time loitering around a snack bar&mdash;as members can see by the size of me, I spend a considerable amount of my life loitering around snack bars&mdash;talking to the locals. I was saying how cold it was and they said, `Where are you from?' I said, `Western Australia,' and they said, `No doubt you would find it particularly cold here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would have been about a dozen people there at that lunchtime. The gentleman behind the counter asked me what I was doing there. I said that I was from the federal parliament, on the Lake Pedder inquiry, and immediately the mood turned hostile. Someone behind the counter said to me, `Why don't you piss off and mind your own business?' When I suggested to someone who was giving evidence that the locals were pretty hostile to what was seen to be minding their business for them, the person said, `Oh, well, that is just a snack bar poll.' I have a suspicion&mdash;I suspect that some of the Tasmanian members on the committee would be able to back it up&mdash;that it is a widely held view in Tasmania that what we were doing was a waste of time and money, and something that we should not have been doing in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my maiden speech, if Abraham Lincoln could do the Gettysburg Address in less than two minutes I can say anything that I have got to say in just a few minutes. I would just like to conclude by thanking my colleagues on the committee, because it has by and large been a pleasant experience. I thank also the secretariat people for the diligence and hard work that they put in; I know that they had a pretty strict deadline that they were working to and in this report they really have done a magnificent job. They have been pleasant to work with all the time, sometimes under considerable duress&mdash;never more so than the day that we visited Lake Pedder. Whilst we were out at Scotts Peak dam we came across some people in distress and the chairman was asked if perhaps we could help them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that we were getting around in a minibus at that time. Being a large person, I went straight to the back seat and I was advised by colleagues who had been on many of these expeditions before not to sit behind the axle. I learnt that that was perfectly correct&mdash;it was a most uncomfortable trip. But I did not have any idea how uncomfortable it was to become. There was a group of army reservists who had been trekking in the Tasmania wilderness for something like a week. They had come down with a bad attack of gastric and were in a pretty debilitated state&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lake Pedder was flooded in 1972 to develop further the hydro-electric schemes in Tasmania. At that time there was a beginning of environment groups all over the world and Lake Pedder in that respect was seen as a rallying cause for the green movement. Tasmanians too were beginning to be more aware of the environmental issues and the beginnings of the movement found a rallying issue in Lake Pedder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts undertook unanimously, I understand&mdash;with support from all sides of the House&mdash;to ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) for a brief to make a feasibility study. There had been a lot of interest in Lake Pedder over the years and there was a feeling, as we have heard this morning, that maybe the lake should be drained and taken back to its original form. There were members of the community that believed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received its brief and I am sure that there were many positions held then within that committee. I thought the issue found a soft spot in many Tasmanians in days gone by. I dare say that today, if the same area were put up for flooding, there would be a much tougher passage. Alternatives to flooding a lake such as the original Lake Pedder would be found or at least looked at. However, with all that aside, the lake has gone from 20 square kilometres to 240 square kilometres. To drain it would leave about 24,000 hectares of mud that would need to be rehabilitated. That would be a mighty task and could not be taken lightly, and there would be a lot of possibilities of things going awfully wrong when such a task was undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain that the committee took those issues pretty seriously when it reached its final conclusion. I know that the task of rehabilitation and trying to put it back together was in the minds of many of the members of the committee. I do not think that members of the committee realised how controversial this would be and some pretty wild assertions were made from many sides of this debate. This is still a very emotive issue in Tasmania and I am sure it is going to be for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked to be involved in the committee when I realised that there were no Tasmanians on it, because this was of vital interest to the state and to the state's economy. At the same time, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) was also invited to be a part of the committee, and I welcomed the presence of another Tasmanian who could put the Tasmanian perspective into the committee deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were one or two who took a shot at me for stating my position before I was invited on to the committee. However, nobody seemed to ask the other members of the committee what their feelings were before they sat on the committee. I know that some of them held views that the lake should be drained. There were many differences in attitude and orientation among members of the committee and it was a relief to find that, athough most could still talk and debate these issues, we had a wide diversity of opinions. That is quite a different matter with some people in the public on this debate where, if people do not get their own way, they sometimes take their bat and ball and go home. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 24 June said that the green groups are withdrawing from the regional forest agreement process. It is a very sad result for their decision making that they would do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman says that he regrets having to come to the conclusion that the lake should not be drained but that he firmly considered that this was the recommendation that most fully reflects the responsibilities of the committee to all Australians and to Australia's natural environment. I know that it was at some cost that some members of the committee had to take this broader view, and I appreciate their deliberations and their approach to the work that took place on this committee. It was a job that was very hard to deal with objectively because it was about spending vast sums of money. The information required in order to make an informed decision was limited and there were many facts that were unavailable. A lot of what we had to deal with was conjecture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hydro was quite detailed in its approach to the issue and had a number of concerns for the future supply of energy for Tasmania. The Tasmanian community, with the government and the opposition, played a vital role in the final decision making process. I think that the joint approach to the committee, in dealing with the Tasmanian economy, investment and people's confidence in the state, by both the government and the opposition, was important to the committee's deliberations.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without cooperation from this source, there may have been little the federal government could do if they had not been prepared to cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hydro-Electric Commission, with its position in the economics of Tasmania, is as much an icon as Lake Pedder is. Thousands of families have worked for the Hydro and its predecessor since 1895. It has been seen as a provider of jobs, security and quality of life and has been almost a father figure to generations of many thousands of Tasmanians. The lakes have been created with great significance. They have great significance in heritage terms. They are part of the state's working history and many thousands of people now enjoy the recreation of those lakes&mdash;including, of course, the new Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people are concerned that, if one lake is drained, there will be nothing to stop others being targeted&mdash;and who will then provide the power to be used for the Tasmanian economy? Of course, Lake Pedder is part of a system that is linked together and its immediate neighbouring lake is Lake Gordon. I do not believe that you would drain Lake Pedder and then leave Lake Gordon where it is, touching that World Heritage area. If you took away Lake Pedder, what would happen to the industries that have settled in Tasmania? What would happen to the jobs that come from those industries? Those are questions that needed to be answered and that the committee had to deal with. That fear that I have talked about is a genuine fear; it is not something that can be taken very lightly and it had to be taken very seriously by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the decision is a very important one for Tasmania's strength in the future and may well come from a very sound grounding in our past. With this sort of infrastructure in place, we can be the providers of ample, clean power that is environmentally friendly, safe and sustainable for Tasmania for years to come. The inquiry was an interesting exercise and tested the ability of all the members of the committee. The report finally had one dissenter and I think that was marvellous, considering the nature of the issue and the nature of the views on the committee. It was a pleasure in that sense to work through the issues knowing that there was such a diverse range of views on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the staff of the committee. The chairmanship was outstanding in working through the different issues and the staff deserve thanks for their tedious work as well. I also thank the member for Langmore for his considerations to me. My task on that committee is now completed. While I would not say it was a pleasurable task, it was one that I am pleased to have participated in and it will be a part of my history. As I will be leaving the committee, I offer my best wishes for its deliberations in the future, especially in looking at the management of World Heritage areas, which will be a major undertaking. And I would like to commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;11.33 a.m.)&mdash;When this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder</EMPHASIS>, was presented in the House on Monday I made some brief comments and I did commend both the chairman and the staff for their work. I also noted that it was quite an achievement to have this report presented prior to parliament rising for the winter recess, because it was very important that the report be out and that the matter be settled, once and for all, ahead of that two-month period. I want to continue now by restating some of the comments I made at that time. I believe that is necessary because of some of the interpretations that have been given by some people to the report and to the personal comments of the chairman, the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I accept the right of the chairman to make those comments, but they were not the comments of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is unfortunate that, in the rush to get the report out, the summary that has been printed is an earlier version of the summary and does not reflect the tighter position of the committee which comes through in the text. So I recommend to anybody who does read the full report that they make sure they have the corrigendum or the correction summary as the basis for understanding what the committee is saying. The report and its recommendations are quite definite: that is, a definite `no' to any draining of Lake Pedder; and a definite `no' to any further assessment or provision of funds for the many areas of research that would be necessary before any serious consideration could be given to the proposal again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman stated in his press release that in his view it was an appalling mistake that Lake Pedder was originally dammed. At least one person in the media has taken that to mean that it was the view of the committee that it was an appalling mistake. Such was not the view of the committee. I am sure that it was the view of the chairman and perhaps one or two others, but it certainly was not the view of the committee and it certainly was not my view. Through all of this my view has been confirmed, if anything, that the damming of Lake Pedder was the correct decision for Tasmania then and remains so now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman said in the preface, also&mdash;as once again is his right and his responsibility&mdash;that he regretted that the committee was not able to come to any other conclusion. That was his view but not the view of the committee. The committee had no such view. As a member of the committee I myself had no regret at all that that was the conclusion, and I believe that was the view of many others of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the reasons for the conclusion, I think not all of those have been stated in media reports, either. There has been a certain interpretation made, that the committee was saying&mdash;as it was not&mdash;that if only more research money could be obtained then perhaps a different conclusion could be reached, and that the only reason why more research money could not be obtained was that there are more important environmental issues throughout Australia that need such money and take priority. The committee did indicate that more research would be needed before any assessment of whether or not it would be appropriate to drain&mdash;not whether to drain but whether it would be appropriate to look again at whether to drain. The committee also indicated that, in its view, it was of low priority to provide any further research funds. Even the environmentalists themselves stated so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee said also, however&mdash;but this is not coming out in many of the reports of the recommendations of the committee&mdash;that there is no political consensus for Pedder to be drained. For a political consensus to occur would mean that both at the Tasmanian level and at the Commonwealth level there would have to be agreement. Tasmanians are firmly against the draining. Both of the major parties are opposed to it, and the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), indicate&mdash;and, I presume, the comments of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) will indicate&mdash;that bipartisan approach of the major parties in Tasmania. I am told that the recent poll indicated that 85 per cent of Tasmanians are opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not real to even give any thought to looking again at Pedder while there are those feelings in Tasmania, and it seems to me that they are going to be there for a long time. I think it does confirm the view of the Tasmanian government, which has been fairly critical of the whole inquiry, that it is not realistic for us at a federal level to be making these sorts of investigations on a serious basis unless there is some element of support from the state government. That is very much in our report, but it has not been coming through. There needs to be political consensus before we can seriously consider anything in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a feeling that somehow or other the committee was of the view that it would have been nice to drain&mdash;in other words, the outcome of an argument definitely for or against. That was never put by the committee in any of its conclusions, and I for one, as I repeat, did not hear one argument which in my view was feasible and supported the draining of Lake Pedder as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our consideration of the report and the question of Pedder, there are two fundamental facts that people have to remember. The first is that the original Lake Pedder was 10 square kilometres, and that included the dunes. The enlarged Lake Pedder, which we are talking about now, is 242 square kilometres. I do not think there is any real problem to any of us that the original Lake Pedder&mdash;that is, the 10 square kilometres&mdash;remains fundamentally in its original form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when we are talking about or considering the draining and restoration of the enlarged Lake Pedder, the original Lake Pedder really is not an issue. The issue is whether or not the other 232 square kilometres, which was basically button grass plain, some rolling hills, a few steep cliffs and so forth, could be restored. There was a dramatic difference, in the evidence we received, between those who thought it could and those who thought it could not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fundamental fact is that the Lake Pedder area was included in the World Heritage listing in 1982&mdash;10 years after the original Lake Pedder was flooded. In fact, the World Heritage listing was strengthened in 1989&mdash;17 years after the original Lake Pedder was flooded. So the question of World Heritage values in relation to draining Lake Pedder is, in my view, also not a real issue. There is some comment suggesting that the World Heritage values could be improved or enhanced if the enlarged Lake Pedder were drained. But draining it is really not an issue as to its World Heritage value, and there is no requirement under World Heritage for the enlarged Lake Pedder to be drained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do regret that the inquiry took place, because it has reopened some old wounds in Tasmania. That has been very obvious, given the reactions and comments that we had down there. It created a divisive situation in Tasmania at a time of economic difficulty in that state. It frightened potential investors, by creating doubt over one of Tasmania's major assets: environmentally friendly hydro power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by one or two&mdash;and I acknowledge the Member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), and respect his right to say it&mdash;that too much time was spent on economic cost. I believe not enough time was spent on that, considering all of the economic aspects and, particularly, the total economic cost of draining Lake Pedder. We did look, in the narrow sense, at the cost of draining in relation to what it might cost to restore the 232 square kilometres that would be, once again, button grass plain and so forth. There is tremendous variation in those costs, and variation concerning whether or not restoration could actually take place. There is great doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The slightly broader economic criterion was the cost of lost power. But we really did not address what economic value is derived from that power. That is what the real question is in Tasmania: the question of the employment, the wealth creation, the exports and so forth for Tasmania that come from utilising one of its major assets&mdash;hydro power. One could look at the number of employees that Comalco has for some evidence of that. Beyond Comalco, one could consider the fears expressed by the rapidly expanding salmon industry and a number of other industries which would see their futures put at risk by the draining of Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my limited time, I also want to dismiss three assumptions that are used by those proposing that Lake Pedder be drained. First of all, they assume that Lake Pedder itself is not significant in the total hydro power scheme structure in Tasmania, and that it holds only a very small percentage of the water of the total Gordon-Pedder system. Of course, that is one of the two dammed or storage systems for hydro power in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who say that do not understand what Lake Pedder is there for. Lake Pedder is a transfer dam. That is, it transfers water from one catchment to another: from the separate catchment of certain rivers, to the Gordon. It actually provides 42 per cent of the total amount of water in the Gordon scheme. It is the same as a lot of the dams in the Snowy Mountains scheme: they transfer water inland but, in themselves, they do not hold great amounts of water. So Lake Pedder is a very significant element in the hydro system in Tasmania and, in particular, in relation to drought proofing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second assumption was that Tasmania has a power surplus and that, therefore, the loss of the power from Pedder is not significant. Tasmania has a lower power surplus than almost any other state in Australia and yet we are not criticising those states with regard to power because they do have to have a safety factor in what is power generation. It is also assumed that power would not be needed. The latest advice we have from the Hydro-Electric Commission in a letter presented to the committee, and subsequently in a fax to me, is that discussions are taking place with companies which would require over 90 megawatts more of power. In fact, contracts have been signed with two companies which will require over 20 megawatts of power more than is presently used in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third assumption was that Comalco is closing at Bell Bay anyway and that, therefore, the power will not be needed even for extra industry. To a certain extent that is based on the fact that there is reduced production at Comalco at the present time. So Comalco, in their view, is no longer serious about Tasmania. People neglect the fact that the reduction in production at Bell Bay is because of an international cartel&mdash;which this federal government supports&mdash;trying to cover the international surplus of aluminium production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comalco stated very clearly and definitely that it will close if Pedder is drained. Comalco has the option to either expand to a world scale operation at Bell Bay or to close. It is not there for just staying around. Remember that aluminium and alumina comprise the second largest export from this country and production units for aluminium around the world are becoming bigger and bigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining time I want to quote part of a fairly significant exchange between Dr Kjar of Comalco and the committee on 8 May 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kjar&mdash;Taken in isolation, the draining of Lake Pedder would make it very difficult for us to proceed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kjar&mdash;To proceed beyond the year 2001.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kjar&mdash;Full stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CHAIR&mdash;Why is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kjar&mdash;Because we cannot see our way clear to expanding the facilities, to put money into a system that does not have the power to sustain us in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr TRUSS&mdash;I take it you only have two options&mdash;either you expand or you close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kjar&mdash;Yes, that is right.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a window of opportunity for Comalco to expand to world scale in the next couple of years. Negotiations are under way between the HEC and Comalco. Those negotiations have had to be interrupted because of this inquiry and they can now proceed seriously. I wish both parties well for the future of Comalco in Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave a dissenting report and I believe what I have said in my dissenting report is correct. I would like to expand on the reasons why I gave that dissenting report. Firstly, I would like to read part of it so that it is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large part of the evidence given to the Committee was on economic costs, and this I believe is the only arguments of the opponents to the proposal to restore Lake Pedder. What price is beauty? What price is a symbol that can inspire people forever? What price for the wonder of looking at a scene unspoilt by human intervention? What price to walk, and listen to the quiet? What price for the restoration of the soul? What price to admire the Creator's work? These prices were not computed in our report. Surely they outweigh other costs.</PARA>
<PARA>I truly believe that. I believe the committee report is another step along the way to the restoration of Lake Pedder. It will happen and it will happen through public pressure. At the present time in Tasmania the government and the opposition are opposed to the restoration of Lake Pedder. Governments and oppositions do not stay there forever. The people who are in the government change. Those people will one day be replaced by other people who, I can assure honourable members, will be more environmentally conscious than the existing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some comments on the report from the Tasmanian government, which was quite vociferous in its abuse of the committee, right up to the tabling of the report. All the way through, the Tasmanian government used the inquiry unmercifully, to gain its own bit of publicity. However, when the time came to appear before the committee, the government squibbed it. One or two days before the members were due to appear before the committee, the Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom, said that they would no longer be appearing before the committee because it was a charade and a farce, et cetera. He did not have the guts to come before this committee and put his arguments. Maybe he was scared of me. I do not know why: I am only one person on the committee, but&mdash;</PARA>

Since he is an ex-Aussie Rules footballer and someone battling away out there who belonged to a team that did not always win the premiership but kept going, I thought that he would probably appear; but he squibbed it. The Tasmanian government came in for some criticism in our report, but I really believe that it should have come in for stronger criticism. Members of the Tasmanian government used their tactic, and they will use it time and time again in election campaigns, et cetera; but they did not have the guts to appear. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, a local paper in Tasmania said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premier Ray Groom said yesterday the Government and Hydro-Electric Commission had spent more than $350,000 providing information to the Federal Parliamentary committee and overall the inquiry would have cost more than $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is just absurd, and it is typical of the sort of allegations that he would make. Straight off the top of his head, he dreams up a figure and says anything. That $350,000 might be what the HEC is charging the state government for putting all its submissions together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that it had done a lot of work on its submissions. It had brought out people from all over the world, and had an expert from California or somewhere, but these experts and the people that the Hydro-Electric Commission was paying were not experts who would come up with a unbiased opinion. If you are being paid X thousands of dollars for an opinion, naturally you are going to come up with one that suits your payer; and they definitely did. The chap from America came up with the figure of $2 1/2 billion dollars to restore Lake Pedder. That is completely outrageous and is complete rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vast sums of money, it has been claimed, would be required to restore these 24,000 hectares buried under the mud. But it is not mud. If the people who made these comments read the report, they would see that there is hardly any mud there at all. Professor Tyler, who is an expert in this area, said there is a couple of millimetres of sediment from the actual lake. The original Lake Pedder had no mud or silt in it. All the water comes from the areas around it, and they are mud free: they are heath and button grass plains, et cetera. So this story about the mud is a load of rubbish, and the cost of restoring it is a load of rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We flew over the Gordon Dam on the day that we were at Lake Pedder, and the water level was the lowest it had been for 21 years. The level had been down for about 10 years, so there was a rim of earth all the way around the dam. If you fly over any dam when it is low, you will see a rim of dirt that has in the past been flooded, where all the plants have died. Such an area of dirt had been exposed above the waterline of the Gordon Dam, because there had been a drought in Tasmania. On that dirt, a huge number of young gum trees only six or seven feet high were growing. Nature had started to restore the area, and I am quite certain that that would happen in relation to this large area around Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of furphies have been put around concerning this subject and words have been used which are completely misleading. We heard people call the dams which were constructed by the Hydro-Electric Commission lakes. They are not lakes, they are dams. A dam is a dam and this is a damn dam. People played word games all the way through the inquiry. A petition about saving Lake Pedder was handed to members of the committee by someone who was on their way out to Lake Pedder. I said, `Yes, I'll take this. I'll save Lake Pedder.' I came to the committee with a biased view. I wanted to pull the plug on it and I will still do it. The petition was aimed at saving the present Lake Pedder. Can you imagine what would happen if that petition got out into the normal populace? If the petition got out there would be big signs saying `Save Lake Pedder' and the petitioners would get a lot of signatures. But the petition was not to save Lake Pedder; it was a petition to save Lake Pedder dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some points in the committee's report with which I disagree. It is claimed that the dam has rolling, drought proof hydro-electric power production. A power station has been built at Bell Bay and this power station does not rely on water. This power station is not used now. It is in mothballs because there is too much power in Tasmania. The power station at Bell Bay is the power station that could drought proof Tasmania, not the other power stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that drainage of Lake Pedder would not necessarily result in increased tourism to Tasmania. The same  comment was made during the campaign to stop the damming of the Franklin. One has only to go to Strahan to see the results of increased tourism. I have not seen it, but, from what I have been told, tourism to the area has increased dramatically. I can assure you that hardly any people go to look at Lake Pedder dam at the moment. When members of the committee visited the area we saw an ex-Hydro building which is being used as a guesthouse. I do not think that the guesthouse has too many customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the dam on Lake Pedder is drained and the original lake is restored, there would be a huge increase in tourism and a restoration industry would be created. Thousands of people could be trained and they could do similar work all over the world. The University of Tasmania could set up a faculty of restoration ecology. Draining Lake Pedder would be a great benefit to the Tasmanian economy, but there are people in Tasmania who cannot see this. They are the people who, in similar words to those used by John F. Kennedy, say, `Some say why, and I say why not?' They are the people who say, `Why? Why do it?' Why do anything in this world? Some people have vision while others look only at the present day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on many occasions, this lake will be restored. Restoration of the lake will create a lot of work in Tasmania and it will create worldwide interest. Restoration of the lake will give back to nature something that people have taken away. Restoration of the lake will show how far we as human beings have progressed in our consideration of the environment. Why do we need to say that we are right and that nature is wrong? Nature has been around for millions of years while we have only been here for the blink of an eyelid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a book written by the wife of Olegas Truchanas there are some beautiful words in relation to Tasmania. At the time the book was written, Olegas Truchanas was trying to save Lake Pedder from being inundated by people from the Hydro-Electric Commission and others, and he was giving speeches and talks in relation to Lake Pedder. The book was printed back in 1975 and is now out of print, but, in looking at the loan details at the back of the book, it can be seen that the book was borrowed frequently in the years from 1975 to 1977. Since then, the book was virtually unused until I took it out in 1995. That fact is quite interesting. It might be 20 years down the track since the book was written, but I assure you that it will not take 20 years to restore Lake Pedder to its original beauty. The book contains a speech that Olegas Truchanas made in 1971. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania is not the only place in the world where long-term, careful argument has been defeated by short-term economic advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat his words when I say that this is all about economics. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we look round, the time is rapidly approaching when natural environment, natural unspoiled vistas are sadly beginning to look like left-overs from a vanishing world. This vanishing world is beautiful beyond our dreams and contains in itself rewards and gratifications never found in artificial landscape, or man-made objects, so often regarded as exciting evidence of a new world in the making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The natural world contains an unbelievable diversity, and offers a variety of choices, provided of course that we retain some of this world and that we live in the manner that permits us to go out, seek it, find it, and make these choices. We must try to retain as much as possible of what still remains of the unique, rare and beautiful. It is terribly important that we take interest in the future of our remaining wilderness, and in the future of our National Parks. Is there any reason why, given this interest, and given enlightened leadership, the ideal of beauty could not become an accepted goal of national policy? Is there any reason why Tasmania should not be more beautiful on the day we leave it, than on the day we came? We don't know what the requirements of those who come after us will be. Tasmania is slowly evolving towards goals we cannot now see. If we can revise our attitudes towards the land under our feet; if we can accept a role of steward and depart from the role of conqueror; if we can accept the view that man and nature are inseparable parts of the unified whole&mdash;then Tasmania can be a shining beacon in a dull, uniform and largely artificial world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That has not changed. Those words are more important now than when he said them in 1975. Tasmania is a unique place on this planet, and we are destroying it slowly by woodchipping and damming beautiful lakes. We can restore one area of Tasmania to how it was. We can leave it to nature to restore it; and I believe nature will restore it, given time. One only has to look at past devastations. Look at Mount St Helens volcanic eruption a few years ago: life is returning there quite rapidly, and life will return to this area of Lake Pedder. I can assure this House that I will do all I can to assist it. I will continue, in whatever capacity I can, to return something to nature. </PARA>

I mean that in the best sense of the term, even though the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has mentioned a whole range of issues quite outside this report. I would like to concentrate for a few minutes on one of the comments which the honourable member for Dunkley has mentioned: the line from Olegas Truchanas that we ought to be good stewards versus conquerors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania, taken as an economic unit in the world, has more of its area in World Heritage reserve than any other country in the world. If we take Tasmania as a country and measure it against Brazil, the United States, Canada, the old Soviet Union, Nigeria and so on, right through the whole world, Tasmania comes in ninth in the area that is reserved; but as a percentage, it has double the figure of any other country in the world. Twenty per cent of Tasmania is in World Heritage reserve, and 30 per cent is totally reserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give people in the other states an idea of what that means in regard to the mainland states and territories, it is like taking all of Queensland, all of New South Wales and all of Victoria and making that a total reserve in regard to heritage values. That is what it would mean. I say to people from other states, `If you want to keep leg-roping Tasmania's capacity to have an economically viable future for its citizens, first of all clean up your own act and reserve as much of your state as we have done.' That is what I say to Victorians. Because people in other states have failed, they now try to impose their views on Tasmania. I say to the other states, `You take up the flag and be a good steward of your own state, without looking over the fence and trying, because you have failed, to impose your views on Tasmania.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just say, `Do what Tasmania has done. We have got 30 per cent of our state in reserves forever&mdash;for our kids, for the world.' I notice that the environment committee's reference now is for the management of World Heritage areas. We have a great World Heritage area, it includes Lake Pedder, and the committee has just decided: do not drain Lake Pedder, and do not investigate it further. That is the commonsense view of all the information that was given to us&mdash;all the information. In fact, we had some people come to us and say, `We have had a look at this lake. In other parts of the world, this is the sort of lake we are trying to recreate. It has got absolutely clean beautiful water, beautiful scenery. This is what we are trying to remake in the rest of the world and here you are thinking of draining it. We cannot understand it.' And that is pretty true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go down to Lake Pedder, there is beautiful scenery that is marvellous and very attractive in world terms. In fact, it is part of the World Heritage area&mdash;that is how beautiful it is. As a committee, we had to consider whether we ought to take the risk of draining it and ending up with a doughnut out there in the World Heritage area forever. It might have ended up as a large area, of 232 square kilometres, with quite different vegetation if it could have been restored adequately&mdash;and there was some doubt about that. Even the leader of the Greens in the Tasmania parliament said that she did not think it would even start to be restored within 25 years. Now you have to start to think what this peat is going to look like after 25 years of getting about 100 inches of rainfall every year on it. Is it going to stay there? We do not know that. I would hope that it would. But there was the possibility that there would be disaster if we took the water away and there would be this large area left that was denuded of plant life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect to this debate is that decisions have been made in regard to this area of Tasmania. We do have a reservoir there for hydro power. Another important debate about the environment in this world is about the greenhouse effect and the cleanest power source in the world&mdash;apart from solar energy, I guess&mdash;is hydro power. Tasmania makes a great contribution to Australia because it does not use coal, it does not send up sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. Why? Because we have a hydro power system which allows the water to run free and Lake Pedder is an integral part of that power system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been debated whether Tasmania has an oversupply of power. I must say that over the 10 years or so in which I have been involved in federal parliament I have met a number of business people, and their big doubt has always been: `Will a state government be able to guarantee the supply of power if we come?' They have said, `Will the Tasmanian state government guarantee it, and can you guarantee that the federal Labour Party and the federal government will not intervene and create difficulties environmentally?' There have been various companies over the years who have looked at Tasmania very seriously. But they decided the risk was far too great during the mid-1980s, because of the environmental debate in Australia, and they moved away. As a consequence, maybe now there is an appearance of an oversupply. But as the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has said, the oversupply in Tasmania is less than in any other state. So I cannot see how that is a valid argument in this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the important point in regard to the future of this committee: the management of World Heritage areas. In Australian terms, Tasmania has a very large World Heritage area but it has not been funded adequately to give good management to this World Heritage area. When we were looking at draining Lake Pedder, the interesting point came up about the actual ecology of the lake as it is now. The lake does have a very enlarged platypus population and, no doubt, if we surveyed the populations of other animals that are now living in that lake area, there would be increased populations of a great diversity of species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the lake was drained, what would happen to the ecology and the ecosystem that exists there now? The environmental movement has argued for 20 years in Australia that we cannot intervene and that we must maintain the ecosystems that exist. There is an ecosystem in Lake Pedder now and why should that not be kept? Why should we take the risk of killing 2,000 or 3,000 platypuses, or however many there are? Why should we take that risk? There is no answer to that and I think this was one of the turning points in the debate, certainly within Tasmania. The Tasmanian people woke up to the argument which they had been fighting for 20 years with the radical Green movement. I say the radical Green movement because there has been a change in consciousness about the environment in the world and I welcome that because I think we are all the better for it. At the same time, commonsense has to be shown when there is an issue such as Lake Pedder. The majority report, which was 13 to one, was a commonsense decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lake Pedder is a beautiful lake, albeit through man-made intervention. A lot of things that men and women do in this world make the world a better place. Sometimes, we improve what nature does. We are part of nature. I reject the idea of the last speaker, the member for Murray, that nature is on one side and people are on the other. We are part of nature. We are integrated with nature and we ought to be good stewards. That is our role: to be good stewards of nature. I believe that Tasmania is doing a very good job of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, on balance, looked at the whole range of issues. It understood the argument that, previously, this was a beautiful natural area of Tasmania. However, we have moved on. A lake has been created and it would be far too great a risk to drain the lake. It is a slim possibility that any benefits would arise. The committee decided that there would be no value in this. I reject the notion that this lake will be drained because, I think, as time goes on, this committee's report will be reflected on. The committee gathered all the information which was available to us as members of the Australian federal parliament. We came down with the very clear conclusion, 13 to one, that this lake should not be drained, nor should it have any further assessment. I think that is a wise decision. </PARA>

One of the arguments for setting them aside is so that people can go there to `re-create their soul,' as many would say, and be able to dwell on nature.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I am wondering whether the previous speaker, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), and I are talking about the same report. I can assure the House that I do not know, and no-one knows, whether Lake Pedder is full of platypus but I can guarantee that his argument is full of red herrings, and that was the thing that we faced throughout the whole of this inquiry. With our limited resources, with our limited time, there is no doubt that we came up with a report that is very inconclusive. It is disappointing, it is predictable, but there is no doubt it is inconclusive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not read into this report the fact that Lake Pedder will never be drained. I support the theory that Australia could set itself apart and show the world that we are truly leaders and we truly care for the environment by placing the draining of Lake Pedder at the pinnacle of priorities and then attempting to do it. Everywhere we turned, we were given what I believe was disinformation; certainly, there was a lack of information. Let us face it, the people in Tasmania live on a furphy. They understand that hydro-electricity is giving them cheap electricity, supporting industry and creating employment. That is furphy No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian people have the third most expensive electricity in Australia. At a time when small business is the major employer in Australia, the Tasmanian government is fully supporting maintaining Lake Pedder and providing electricity to an aluminium smelter at subsidised rates. At the same time, it is saying to the rest of the Tasmanian people, `You will have to pay high prices for your electricity to subsidise this smelter.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that we could not determine, that we were not told, is whether Comalco is going to stay in Tasmania or not. The Tasmanian government has given it an assurance that it will continue to provide it with cheap electricity. Our report is not conclusively saying one way or another whether Lake Pedder should be drained. So it has the guarantee that Lake Pedder will stay there, it has the guarantee that electricity will continue to be cheap. But there will be other factors that will determine in the next couple of years whether Comalco will quit Tasmania or not. The chances are they probably will. If that does happen, I would see that as a major factor in forming the future for Tasmania, a future which would be considerably rosier without that smelter than it is today with the smelter. Suddenly, it would give the Tasmanians the drive to go out and seek small business and small industries to come to Tasmania. They could offer them cheaper electricity than they are currently able to get from the HEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other furphy, of course, is that Lake Pedder is there to drought proof the hydro-electric system in Tasmania. It does not do that, because we can only use 1.6 metres of the water that is currently stored in this 242 square kilometre artificial lake. If there is a need to draw down the water of Lake Pedder more than that 1.6 metres differential, then the Tasmanian government has to meet and it has to pass special legislation. In the last 10 years of drought that has existed in Tasmania, that has not been necessary. So the water that is stored in Lake Pedder has not been used to drought proof the hydro-electric scheme and it certainly does not appear that it is going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are a great many furphies&mdash;all this uncertainty. When the committee proposed a positive step saying, `Let us look at the possibilities of doing something exciting, something positive in relation to the environment,' it was always the question of the unknown, the fact that `We believe this to be so, but we can't prove it and you can't prove it.' It was said, `If you want to drain the lake, you cannot prove that the original lake is going to be restored.' Of course, no-one knows whether the original lake is going to be restored to its original condition, but I do say this: it would be very exciting to try. It would be a symbol for the world to say that, for the first time in history, a small nation such as Australia has the courage to say that there is more to this world than economics, and that this world needs to make sure that it conserves environmental factors that will maintain a living standard suitable for all species, not only the human species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard this rubbish about platypus. Now some people seem to think that platypus are fish. Platypus are air breathing mammals, they are monotremes. They are not spread homogeneously throughout a lake; they are animals that nest in the banks. I can assure honourable members that the middle of Lake Pedder is no environment to go and catch a platypus. They would be found around the banks of the lake. Of course, there has been no mention about the millions of trout, the introduced species, that are there and the harm that they are doing to natives that may also live in that water. We accept that as a fact. Everywhere we turned we were given misinformation. We were told, `You can't prove that, you don't know.' So unfortunately I believe that the report is very predictable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the economic argument to retain Lake Pedder is completely false. Unfortunately, we had to pay credence to it. At no time could we be told what Comalco is paying for electricity; that is confidential information. I respect that, but I believe that the government of Tasmania did have the right and the responsibility to come and meet with our committee. Yet a day before we were due to meet with that government it elected not to come and speak with the committee. Personally, if I were a Tasmanian I would think that the effrontery of that government was intolerable in such an important issue as this. The people of Tasmania have a right to expect that their government will lay all the cards on the table in this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that, if the people who dammed Lake Pedder in 1972 had had to go through the same course and to answer all of the questions that are being asked of the proponents that the lake be drained, the lake would never have been dammed in the first place. I have no doubt about that. I would just point out that Edward St John, who carried out the inquiry into Lake Pedder and its damming in 1974&mdash;and who was not from this side of politics&mdash;said, `Our children will undo the crimes that we have done.' That was his opinion of what the damming of this lake meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly was a major change to a wilderness area. It certainly was a major change to a very sensitive ecosystem. I believe all right thinking Australians owe it the world to say, `We are prepared to have a go to right that wrong decision.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout our inquiry we kept getting statements such as that the erosion would have changed it&mdash;of course the erosion will have changed it&mdash;and that we would never get the button grass or the same ecosystem re-establishing. I do not know that, and the people who propose that do not know it either, because it has never been done. But how interesting to try. How interesting simply to carry out an experiment and draw down the lake a couple of metres to see what the natural process of regeneration would allow. We heard all about how introduced plant species would take over, and the weeds would dominate. There was no proof, but the committee had to listen to that. We had to pay credence because similarly we could not say that it would not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, there would have to be human intervention. I believe that that human intervention had the potential to be minimal. But how exciting to say to a group of horticulturists, `Let us see what we can see and show the way to the world.' We are not going to do that, and I am a bit saddened. I certainly hope that in years to come the Australian parliament will debate this issue again. I would like it to be in my lifetime; it might not be. The children of Australia should not be discouraged by this report. They should take this report and say that it has enormous potential. </PARA>

I am proud of some of the questions that I asked of the people who gave evidence. I am extremely disappointed with the result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) delivered its findings and recommendations in a classified report that was submitted to the government on 31 March 1995. The commission was constituted by the Hon. Gordon Samuels AC, QC and Mr Michael Codd AC. The public report&mdash;also known as the Samuels report&mdash;was tabled on 1 June. It summarises the commissioners' findings and recommendations on the grievances of two former ASIS officers and on the overall accountability and management of ASIS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will comment on the two major recommendations of the commission. The first recommendation is that ASIS should be given a legislative basis to replace the existing executive authority. The Samuels report said that legislation would reassure the public and dispel the persistent mythology that ASIS is unaccountable. The second major recommendation of the Samuels report is that ASIS should be brought under the scrutiny of a parliamentary committee. This proposal has the potential to have a more substantial impact on the management of ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission recommended that the proposed committee should combine with the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and that it should have the power to initiate its own inquiries, except in operationally sensitive matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation and parliamentary scrutiny are two of the ways suggested by the commission to provide a compromise between ASIS's need for security and the free flow of information in the public arena. I do not propose to discuss the government's contentious proposal to jail journalists who disclose sensitive information. That does not mean that I agree with it&mdash;only that it is a subject for another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1977, ASIS, established by executive direction on 13 May 1952, was publicly acknowledged by the Australian government as Australia's foreign intelligence agency. It is responsible for the covert foreign intelligence collection, of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke in his statement of 22 July 1992. Its intelligence collectors are stationed overseas and, because of sensitivity, details of its operations are not revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report, the commission described in some detail the process of accountability for ASIS. The Samuels report sets out the government endorsed definition of accountability&mdash;one which emanates from the Australian Public Service. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of the relationship between public servants, secretaries of departments and ministers, and ministers and the Parliament, accountability is defined as existing where there is a direct authority relationship within which one party accounts to a person or body for the performance of tasks or functions conferred, or able to be conferred by that person or body.</PARA>
<PARA>The accountability obligations of public officials and bodies are met through controls. According to the commissioners, `control' means that an individual or body is subject to an institution's or a person's oversight, direction or request that they provide information on their action, or justify it before a review authority. Information is central to effective control and accountability relationships. An individual or body can be held to account only by those who have access to relevant information on performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, the Director-General of ASIS and senior government officials all accepted that ASIS should be part of the system of public accountability with appropriate modifications to meet security needs. There are extensive arrangements for the accountability and control of ASIS within the executive government and the evidence presented to the commissioners is that they have been exercised effectively since the second Hope royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under existing arrangements the basis for the control and accountability of ASIS within the executive government is the directive issued to the director-general by the minister for foreign affairs after it was endorsed by the security committee of cabinet. It sets out the functions of ASIS and proscribes one former function: training for, or carrying out, covert action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It requires that ASIS obey Australian law and that its activities conform to the foreign policy of the government of the day. The directive places ASIS under the control of the director-general, subject to the directions of the minister for foreign affairs. It authorises the director-general, subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, to brief the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The director-general is personally responsible for all key operational decisions. The effectiveness of the control and accountability of ASIS depends crucially on the competence of both the minister and the director-general and the trust between them. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no controlling role over ASIS in a managerial or operational sense. The commissioners found an extensive, thorough and effective web of checks and balances within the internal management of operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another form of accountability within the executive government is ASIS's position in relation to the Office of National Assessments, which reports annually on the performance of the intelligence collection agencies, including ASIS. However, the service has been subject to little direct scrutiny from outside the executive government. The need for operational secrecy has meant that the normal instruments of external accountability&mdash;direct parliamentary scrutiny and oversight by the Auditor-General&mdash;do not apply fully to ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such parliamentary oversight as exists is subject to government control. The government can refuse access to necessary information, as with the policy of neither confirming nor denying non-official claims about the security and intelligence agencies. Scrutiny of the budget and other aspects of agency operations by parliamentary committees, particularly Senate estimates committees, provides a mechanism for oversight of the public sector. However, little use has been made of this technique in respect of ASIS. The service is funded through a one-line entry in the appropriation bills and budget papers, but ASIS officers do not attend Senate estimate committee hearings. No other parliamentary committees have examined ASIS's activities or administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other opportunities for limited external accountability include the provision in the directive for the Leader of the Opposition to be briefed by the director-general and the auditing of ASIS's non-operational accounts by the Auditor-General. ASIS has never been subject to a performance audit by the Auditor-General in any area of its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Samuels report recognised that an intelligence agency cannot carry out many of its legitimate functions, and thus serve the interests of national security, without a high level of secrecy about its operations, personnel and techniques. At the same time, many of the foreign intelligence agencies of other countries now face more comprehensive systems of control and accountability than does ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the comparable agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom both have a statutory base and formal relationships with review committees of their legislatures. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which has only domestic security functions, has been subject to oversight by an independent statutory committee of privy councillors since 1984 and, more recently, has come under the oversight of a parliamentary subcommittee. As a matter of principle, agencies which exercise the powers and use the resources which Australians give their government should be accountable to the Australian community for their actions. There is no doubt that ASIS must become subject to public sector accountability standards. The accountability mechanisms must, however, be appropriately modified to take account of the need for operational secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of accountability within the executive government, the commissioners concluded in their report that the accountability and control of a secret organisation with sensitive functions should not depend to the extent that it presently does on the personal characteristics and capabilities of the minister for foreign affairs and the Director-General of ASIS and the relationship between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioners also found that it was desirable that external accountability for ASIS be enhanced because the service exercises significant governmental powers. The Samuels report quotes the words of Mr Justice Hope that the fundamental consideration favouring legislative authority for ASIS is that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament is the instrument of democratic control of government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>In the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security of 1977, Mr Justice Hope recommended the statutory incorporation of ASIS, the principal advantage being the conferral of legitimacy. In this report His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation, by giving the service a proper role assigned to it by Parliament, would establish it as part of the family of government. It would thereby favourably improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and, by removing a cause of unease amongst some of its officers, enhance its morale.</PARA>
<PARA>While the legislation could not be expected to say with any particularity how and under what conditions ASIS should operate in Australia to collect foreign intelligence, save in compliance with Australian law, Mr Justice Hope believed that it was worthwhile to obtain from parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the maximum authority and control consistent with the essential need for secrecy . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It became clear during the course of the Samuels inquiry that ASIS itself was keen to be placed on a legislative basis. The service submitted that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present legal basis of the Service may no longer be as appropriate as it once was</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. This, together with the policy of not commenting on allegations about ASIS, may lead to concern among members of the public and Parliament that ASIS is somehow `out of control'. Greater transparency in regard to the already extant oversight and accountability arrangements for ASIS is, in the Service's view, easily achieved and would allay what concerns there are in the Parliament, Government and the wider community. A statutory basis for ASIS would enhance both the sense and the reality of its accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>The commissioners concluded that legislation to continue ASIS in existence and to provide authority for its activities is desirable in principle and will be of benefit in practice. I respectfully agree with that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the content of such legislation would have to be carefully considered and drafted in order for it to serve its purposes. I note that the government response to the Samuels report foreshadows the introduction of legislation at the earliest practical opportunity. I urge the government to give the appropriate priority to this task and to provide a draft of the proposed legislation to the coalition for examination as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Samuels report recommended that, if the parliament is to approve ASIS's charter by passing legislation, the parliament should also be able to review the way in which the charter is put into practice. One way to accomplish this is through parliamentary committee scrutiny. The commissioners considered that any committee to oversee ASIS would itself require a legislative base, including provisions to address security concerns by setting limits to the disclosure of information and prescribing penalties for unauthorised disclosure. The commissioners were of the view that, given an appropriate legislative base, Australian and overseas experience suggest that security could reasonably be assured. In the US, the Central Intelligence Agency answers to permanent select committees and to separate appropriation committees of each house of Congress; it is subject to the Intelligence Oversight Act 1980 and to accountability provisions in its own statute, the National Security Act 1947. Members of the select committees, which have wide powers of oversight and review, are appointed by the presiding officers of the respective houses, subject to maximum terms of membership for six years for the house committee and eight years for the senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each committee is given access, under secure conditions, to extensive information on intelligence activities. One function of the select committees is to authorise the CIA's annual budget, separately from the work of the appropriation committees. In this lengthy process, the CIA is required to provided detailed justification of its budget to each committee. The commissioners observed that this power over the CIA's budget greatly strengthens the capacity of the committees to oversee the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no formal limit to the information which the committees can request. In practice, limits to access have been negotiated between them and the CIA. The committees are told in general terms about the methods used, the types of operations conducted and the sources which the CIA has. Particular sources and methods are not identified except in exceptional circumstances, when the information will be confined, for example, to a senior staff member and the chair and ranking minority member of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general counsel to the senate select committee told Commissioner Samuels that he had not, in eight years of working for the committee, encountered an information problem which he could not negotiate satisfactorily with the CIA. Commissioner Samuels found that comments about the congressional oversight system in the US were overwhelmingly positive, despite the significant administrative burden which the system imposes on the CIA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a strong theme of accountability which was reinforced by congressional oversight. The congressional oversight apparently helps the CIA to do its job better. Commissioner Samuels found that having to account to congressional communities concentrates the minds of managers in the agency, who pay attention to detail as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Congress has become the advocate for the intelligence agencies, which have no other constituency; it legitimises the intelligence budget and is a layer of support and protection for the agencies. In addition, the commissioner learnt that the congressional committees have a very good record of not leaking, with the result that the intelligence community has become progressively more trusting of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom, the intelligence and security committee was established in 1994 by the Intelligence Services Act. Its function is to examine the expenditure and administration policy of the security service, secret intelligence service and government communications headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee consists of nine members of parliament&mdash;none of them ministers&mdash;who are appointed by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. Information sought by the committee can be withheld if it is sensitive information, defined as information which might lead to the identification of sources, other assistance or operational methods, information about particular operations, or information supplied by another government, where that government does not consent to its disclosure. Information may also be withheld from the committee where the foreign minister has determined that it should not be disclosed, but the minister may not make such a determination on the grounds of national security alone. Sensitive information may be disclosed to the committee if the government considers it safe to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British committee has several distinct features. First, it is not a parliamentary committee, since its members are appointed by the Prime Minister and not elected by the parliament. Secondly, the committee reports to the Prime Minister, rather than to parliament, although the Prime Minister is required to table at least an edited version of the committee's reports. Thirdly, the committee is staffed from the cabinet office by a member of the staff of the intelligence coordinator and not by the staff appointed by the committee, as would ordinarily be the case. These arrangements are intended to ensure high-calibre membership of the committee. Other comparisons can be made with the Canadian domestic body&mdash;the Canadian Security Intelligence Service&mdash;but, in the interests of time, I will not&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I am indebted to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am certainly indebted to the member for Chifley (Mr Price). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canada does not have a foreign intelligence collection agency. The domestic security service is subject to extensive arrangements for accountability to the parliament. The legislation regulating the Canadian Security Intelligence Service provides for a permanent Security Intelligence Review Committee with oversight functions. SIRC reports annually to the Canadian parliament. Its members are all privy councillors, an office usually, but not exclusively, reserved for former cabinet ministers. In recent times, the members of SIRC have been respected citizens who have been created privy councillors for the purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canadian parliament also has a subcommittee of the parliament's justice committee which operates as the subcommittee on national security. This is not a standing committee and has to be established by each parliament. The subcommittee's role is to review and consider the management and operations of CSIS and SIRC. The subcommittee has no legislative framework and so defines its own functions and powers by evolution. The subcommittee relies on the prerogatives of the parliament to require individuals to appear or produce documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of those overseas experiences, the commissioners examined several models for a parliamentary committee to oversee ASIS. The commissioners favoured a standing joint statutory committee with a broad charter to review the activities, expenditure and administration of ASIS, exercising its functions principally through in camera hearings. The committee would have sufficient access to information to assure effective oversight, but that access would be under secure conditions and subject to rules capable of preventing release of information without authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioners recommended that a single intelligence and security committee cover both ASIS and ASIO. The commissioners recommended that the membership be small&mdash;a maximum of six if the committee were to cover ASIS only, or eight if the committee were established to oversee both ASIS and ASIO. Membership would be divided equally between the government and non-government parties and drawn from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The government chair would have a deliberative and a casting vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as conducting the review of the activities, expenditure and administration of ASIS, the commissioners said that the committee could conduct specific inquiries on its own initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its response to this recommendation of the Samuels report, the government accepted in principle the value of limited parliamentary oversight of ASIS. However, the government does not fully accept the model proposed by the commissioners for the parliamentary committee. The government favours separate oversight committees for ASIS and for ASIO, due to the different activities of the two agencies, instead of a combined committee. The government agrees with the size and make-up of the committee as recommended in the Samuels report, but prefers a limited role for the committee. It proposes that the committee secretariat be security-cleared and seconded from the executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said in its response to the report that the committee's role would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to review the expenditure and administration of ASIS, and ASIS's compliance with Australian law and other rules and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>The government also confirmed that, while it proposed amending the ASIS directive in line with other recommendations of the Samuels report, the modifications would largely be consequential on the enactment of legislation and would not entail any alteration to ASIS's basic functions and powers. The government has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASIS will still be prevented from carrying out, or training to carry out, covert action, by which we mean interference in the internal affairs of other countries by means of paramilitary action or covert interference in politics.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that statement, the role of the parliamentary committee must be sufficiently wide to ensure that it can examine allegations of non-compliance with that requirement. It is by no means clear that this would come within the government's phrase of `compliance with Australian law and other rules and procedures'. To this extent, the government's response to the recommendations of the Samuels report is inadequate. The recommendation of the commissioners as to the committee's role, particularly in relation to the initiation of inquiries, is preferable. The tension between, on the one hand, examination of allegations of non-compliance with the covert action ban and, on the other hand, the restriction on the examination of sensitive operational matters would have to be resolved in a practical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience in the United States of America suggests that too much commitment to the intelligence services by a parliamentary committee might be more of a problem than would too much independence, with the result that the intelligence oversight committee becomes captured by the intelligence agencies. This has been described by one writer as the result of `the seductiveness of secrets'. Indeed, Justice Hope referred to the hazards for committee members of knowing too much, and thereby feeling a shared responsibility for outcomes, and he gave this as a reason for restricting a committee's access to some types of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Commissioner Samuels observed that most of the Congress intelligence committees have taken an advocative approach on behalf of the intelligence services. This lends support to the argument that parliamentary involvement in ASIS as well as ASIO could help to generate public support for those services, at a time when changes in the strategic situation might seem to make such services less necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly commend to the government the proposals in the Samuels report for the introduction of a legislative basis for the existence and operation of ASIS and for the establishment of a joint statutory parliamentary committee which will oversee ASIS in an appropriate way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I am very pleased that I was able to secure the call, and I would like to commend the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) for his contribution on ASIS this afternoon, which has been no less than his normal well-considered contribution to the debates in this place. Firstly, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you may recall that there were some very serious allegations made by some former officers of ASIS, allegations which were taken up in particular by a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. I thought that I should read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record one of the comments in the Samuels report. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To take the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program as an example, the introduction promised stories of `Australia's disturbing secret involvement in wars, coups and political intrigue'. But the level of factual accuracy about operational matters was not high&mdash;neither here nor in other media reports. Indeed, to paraphrase a book review attributed to A E Houseman, `what was disturbing was not true, and what was true was not disturbing'.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that we should offer that reassurance to the Australian people about those wild allegations. I concur with the report's suggestion that there should be adequate parliamentary review of ASIS. Unlike a lot of members of parliament, I have had the opportunity previously to be briefed by Mr Furner, the Director-General, as he then was, in charge of ASIS, so I know a little, but not a lot, of the good work that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not altogether accept the government's proposition that there needs to be a separate committee. I am certainly of the view that there could be a joint standing committee of the parliament charged with oversighting both ASIS and ASIO. I concur with the comments that there is a danger as far as committee members are concerned in dealing with intelligence matters. One criticism I make of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is that we are too bipartisan in that we get too attached to defence and sometimes we are just not critical enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is a problem in the defence area, I am sure it would be more so in the intelligence area. I must say it would be one of the committees of the parliament, and we do have them, where a great deal of bipartisanship would need to operate to make it successful. I think a key factor would be that, if at any stage there was any irresponsibility in terms of leaking some of the information that was put before that committee, it would do great damage to the standing of the committee and the operation of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that there should be a legislative framework for ASIS, and I certainly strongly concur with that recommendation. I am very pleased to see that the government has picked up and agreed to the recommendation. But, as pointed out by the honourable member for Tangney, we have yet to actually see the draft bill. As is not uncommon in these matters, there seems to be a lengthy delay between a decision to legislate, the preparation of drafting instructions and the actual production of the bill itself. Hopefully, we can anticipate that we will be able to have that legislation debated and enacted before the parliament is dissolved for other more exciting things. I certainly approve of the legislative basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also point out that it has been the practice in relation to ASIS that the Leader of the Opposition is routinely briefed on ASIS matters and shadow ministers are briefed on a needs basis on ASIS matters. That practice is a very important one and one which would continue under the recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has shown that there has been no evidence whatsoever that ASIS has acted outside the guidelines imposed by the government. There is no evidence of any unauthorised activity which was carried in the more sensational reports in the media, and I frankly regret that those reports were ever made in the first place. It is interesting that we impose accountability standards on Public Service departments, we are imposing accountability standards on ASIS, but we live in a society&mdash;maybe this is an important feature of our society&mdash;where the media can irresponsibly, in my view, report matters that are grossly factually inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased with the suggestion that ASIS should no longer continue to rely solely on the proposition that it will neither confirm or deny any particular allegation. The report suggested that the organisation should selectively from time to time background some of the journalists where they seek to be backgrounded and so kill off some of the more fanciful and mostly inaccurate things that they are preparing to write. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying that, notwithstanding the accountability that is proposed in the report and that we have discussed in the debate so far, if intelligence operations are to remain effective, they need to be secret and known only by the agency conducting them. It is not possible to conduct intelligence in any other way. One of the important considerations for Australia is that we tend to place a great deal of reliance not just on ASIS, which is our overseas operation, but also on all intelligence services&mdash;we have a number of them&mdash;in terms of security for Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Pensioner Concession Cards for 1995 were issued at the end of 1994 to 2.6 million pensioners and older long term allowees in receipt of payment at 25 October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An estimated 37,700 persons (1.5% of the total group entitled to cards at 25 October 1994) were no longer entitled by the time the cards were all delivered in mid-December 1994. Of these, an estimated 12,600 had died in the interim period and the remainder had lost pension eligibility owing to income, employment, departure overseas or other reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) When payment is cancelled, pensioners are advised that they cannot use their Pensioner Concession Card after the cancellation date, and are asked to destroy the card so that nobody can misuse it. Steps are not taken to recover cards but some cards are voluntarily returned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scope for misuse of cards to which people are no longer entitled is further reduced by data-matching facilities which provide:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a daily on-line data exchange between DSS and the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), which assists the HIC to ensure that Commonwealth pharmaceutical concessions are not supplied to persons who are no longer current cardholders; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a Client Confirmation Service, which is widely used by State and local government concession providers, such as councils and electricity authorities, that provide regular concessions to many pensioners. These concession providers send computer tapes to DSS at regular intervals to confirm claimants' continuing eligibility for the card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) See the answer to (2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The cost to the Commonwealth of possible misuse of pharmaceutical and other health concessions by people not entitled to them is not quantifiable, but is likely to be of a very low order owing to the use by Commonwealth health concession providers of the data-matching facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cards are issued to pensioners and allowees for the primary purpose of facilitating their access to the Commonwealth pharmaceutical and health benefits. For State instrumentalities that also use the card, the cost of possible misuse of cards in respect of some of the most valuable core concessions States provide to cardholders (rates, electricity, motor vehicle registration), though similarly unquantifiable, is also minimised by the providers' use of the data-matching facilities. The cost to the States of possible misuse in respect of State public transport and other concessions is unknown.</PARA>
