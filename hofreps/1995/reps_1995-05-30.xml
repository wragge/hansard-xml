<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has announced that the public share offer for the Commonwealth's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas Airways Ltd will take place in the middle of 1995. The Qantas Sale Act 1992, which established the legislative and administrative framework for the sale, received royal assent on 21 December 1992. Consistent with the conditions then prevailing in the aviation industry, the Qantas Sale Act imposed a limit of 35 per cent on the level of foreign ownership of Qantas. This was supported by a limitation on individual foreign holdings of 25 per cent, and a range of national interest provisions ensuring that Qantas's Australian status would be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statutory national interest provisions require that Qantas be incorporated in Australia, its main operations base and headquarters remain in Australia and the name of `Qantas' be preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger service. In addition, it is a requirement that the chairman of Qantas and at least two-thirds of the board be Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the 1993 amendments, the Air Navigation Act 1920 includes the same national interest provisions as the Qantas Sale Act, and requires that foreign airlines can hold no more than 25 per cent individually and 35 per cent in total of an Australian international airline other than Qantas. However, the Air Navigation Act imposes no overall limitation on holdings by foreigners other than foreign airlines, although if foreign holdings moved above 49 per cent, international carrier status may be challenged by Australia's bilateral aviation partners on the grounds that the carrier may no longer be seen as substantially Australian owned and controlled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes it is desirable that Qantas should be subject to a similar foreign ownership regime as applies to Ansett and other potential Australian international airlines. Therefore, the government proposes in this bill to increase the overall foreign ownership limit for Qantas from 35 to 49 per cent and to restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than 25 per cent individually and 35 per cent in total of Qantas. The national interest provisions of the Qantas Sale Act would remain unchanged, as would the existing 25 per cent limit on individual holdings of foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that all of its Australian ownership and control objectives for Qantas, as well as obligations under Australia's bilateral aviation treaties, would still be met under a higher foreign ownership limit. Placing Qantas in a similar position as applies to Ansett&mdash;and any other emerging Australian international airlines&mdash;will have no effect on Qantas's Australian status. That status is protected statutorily by the national interest provisions and the overall foreign ownership limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A consequence of the proposed change in foreign ownership limitations on Qantas is that the sizeable Qantas float would be able to access additional demand from international equity markets. British Airways already owns 25 per cent of the 35 per cent of Qantas's shares available to foreign investors and, consequently, without any change in the overall limit, a maximum of only 10 per cent could be sold to other foreigners. Indications were that under these arrangements there would be substantial unsatisfied offshore demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The participation of foreign investors should therefore assist in attracting full value for the Qantas offer, as the bids of those who routinely value and trade in international airline stocks could be accommodated. This could further the government's objective of seeking, on behalf of taxpayers, the most successful outcome for the float. The ability of foreigners to participate more fully could also assist in establishing a healthy after market for Qantas's stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interests of taxpayers should be better served if any additional offshore demand is able to be taken into account in establishing a fair and justifiable price for the sale of Qantas. In saying this it has to be recognised that even if substantial foreign demand for Qantas's shares emerges, Australian investors will be allocated more than two-thirds of the government's remaining 75 per cent shareholding. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995, I think it is worthy to point out that Qantas, in fact, has featured in no less than the last five budgets of this government. Indeed, you could say it has made five farewell appearances from public ownership and could well be known as the Dame Nellie Melba of privatisation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to amend the Qantas Sale Act 1992 to increase the foreign ownership limit in the Qantas privatisation from 35 per cent of issued capital to 49 per cent and to restrict foreign airlines to holding no more than a combined 35 per cent of the issued share capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that none of the amendments in the bill affect the primary financial impact arising from the sale. However, there is only one reason the government is putting forward the bill, and that is to increase the proceeds of the Qantas float. That is the real intention of the bill&mdash;to increase that foreign ownership limit would help to ensure an appropriate return to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been reported in various publications around Australia that the foreign ownership decision may add $200 million to $300 million to the value of the float. That, of course, is the real driving force behind this decision to flog off an additional percentage of Qantas to foreign ownership. It is this potential $300 million decision which is part of the greatest fraud of the government's budget, and I use the word `fraud' advisedly. We are told it is a surplus, but the government's own documentation shows, in fact, it is a deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the privatisation proceeds to pretend that we are seeing a surplus is something which, I think, has now been shown and understood by the Australian people to not be a fair dinkum budget. It is about time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) understands that the asset sales do not equate with expenditure restraint, and to suggest that it is fiscally responsible to use such revenue for recurrent expenditure is simply a swindle. It is like selling off the family home to pay for the groceries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisation proceeds should be used largely to retire debt and to relieve the onerous burden imposed by that debt on us all and on our children in the future. Labor's credibility gap on privatisation proceeds is steadily becoming a gulf. You can be sure that the government's asset sales forecasts in the budget are wrong. After all, they have been wrong almost every year for the last decade. Since Labor came to power, actual privatisation proceeds have fallen short of budget estimates by a whopping $5.1 billion. So why should anyone believe that in this 12-month period we are going to see a realisation of the $5.3 billion that is itemised in the budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the history of the Qantas float itself makes the point very well that this government is a perfidious government. Initially faced with uncommercial debt to equity ratios, the boards of Qantas and the former Australian Airlines repeatedly raised with the government from 1988 the possibility of greater access to equity capital. In September 1990, the government addressed the issue and decided to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a scoping study, the government announced in April 1991 that the sale of both airlines would proceed on the basis of a trade sale. Submissions of expressions of interest from prospective buyers, including indicative non-binding bids, were invited and from these the operational efficiency gains of combining Qantas and Australian Airlines became clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then move to 1992. In June of that year, it was announced that Qantas would be permitted to acquire Australian Airlines for $400 million and that 100 per cent of the expanded Qantas group would be sold rather than 49 per cent as had been originally decided. The community's interest was said to be protected by a number of national interest safeguards. These safeguards required the Qantas articles of association to contain provisions ensuring several points. These are as follows: that total foreign ownership was not to exceed 35 per cent; that no single foreign interest could exceed 25 per cent; that Qantas's operational base and headquarters would remain in Australia; that the name `Qantas' would be preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services; that the company would be incorporated in Australia; and that at least two-thirds of the Qantas board would be Australian citizens. The chairman of the board was to be Australian and the directors were to be provided with broad powers, including the power to deny registration or to force the disposal of shares held by foreigners to ensure that foreign ownership limits were not breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 act imposed a restriction to prevent votes of substantial foreign shareholdings, defined as being more than 15 per cent of voting shares in Qantas, being counted in any vote to appoint or remove more than one-third of the directors of Qantas at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of these requirements&mdash;and the 35 per cent foreign ownership limit in particular&mdash;the then Minister for Finance, now the Treasurer (Mr Willis), stated in the second reading speech on 4 November 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These safeguards are important to maintain the basic character of Qantas, as well as to ensure that Qantas's operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not put under threat. Once in legislation, these safeguards will not be subject to the whim of the Government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement, very simply, reveals the outrageous hypocrisy of the government's decision to increase the foreign ownership at its own whim just because it suddenly needs the money to spend. It is just the same as the l-a-w law tax cuts being done away with and suddenly transposed into superannuation payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question remains: why was the 35 per cent limit, in the words of the current Treasurer, `important to maintain the basic character of Qantas' in 1992 when today it can be subject to the whim of a government desperate to get its hands on more cash to finance its supposed government surplus?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was not your consideration. We should expect this sort of hypocrisy from the government when it comes to Qantas and aviation in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister announced the open skies agreement with New Zealand, which, by November 1994, would have allowed Air New Zealand to compete in the domestic Australian market and open up the New Zealand market to Australian players. By June 1994 it was made known to the government that the open skies agreement would have a substantial impact on the profitability of Qantas. Less than a week before the single aviation market was to take effect, a fax from the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) revealed that the Australian government had reneged on the agreement. At a meeting between our Prime Minister and the New Zealand finance minister on 8 November 1994, it was made clear that plans for a single aviation market would not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This from the Prime Minister who struts the international stage to declare to the world that he is a defender of free trade. Really? Thus the additional value for Qantas was preserved. The future of the open skies agreement may rest with the planned sale of News Corporation's half stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand and any future dealing with the Qantas interest in Air New Zealand. The disposal of the Qantas stake was referred to as the `best solution' by Dr Peter Forsyth of the University of New England at a recent AIC conference in a paper titled `Aviation 1995'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to 1993 and the amendment that resulted in that year. The government's original timetable was for the Qantas privatisation to be finalised by November 1993. A provision of the 1992 act provided that relevant sections of the act would lapse on 31 December 1993 if the sale process had not been completed. The trade sale of 25 per cent to British Airways for $665 million was finalised in March 1993, but it was announced in July 1993 that the float of the remaining 75 per cent would be delayed until the 1994-95 financial year. This decision necessitated the passage of the Qantas Sale Amendment Act 1992 which extended the sale process to a deadline of 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we move on to 1994. We had yet another amendment act. In September last year the Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic share transfer system, the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, known as CHESS, became operational. As a condition of listing on the Stock Exchange, Qantas would be required to be eligible to participate in CHESS. Under the Qantas Sale Act 1992, however, power was conferred on the directors to refuse to register any transfer of shares which would have resulted in the 35 per cent foreign ownership limit being breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These powers, very simply, were inconsistent with the CHESS rules, which allowed unrestricted economic transfer and settlement in shares. Accordingly, the parliament enacted the Qantas Sale Amendment Act 1994 which provided that the Qantas articles of association no longer imposed restrictions on the transfer of shares to give effect to the foreign ownership limit. The government maintained that the disenfranchisement and divestiture provisions which remained in the articles would ensure that the legislative requirements of Qantas to monitor and enforce the foreign ownership restrictions would in fact be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timetable for the float was progressively delayed by the government to accommodate the further delay. The 1994 act extended the legislative sunset clause by two months to 31 August 1995. The 1994 act removed any ambiguity in pre-existing legislation by providing that the foreign shareholding provisions in the Air Navigation Act 1920 no longer applied to Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So we come to the actual mechanics of the sale and the appointment of consultants. The float was again delayed on 31 January 1995, with the announcement that the proceeds from the float would not be expected until the 1995-96 financial year, the subject of the current budget. To assist the float process, the following parties were appointed: the Rowland Company to implement a communications strategy to encourage widespread public participation; Ernst and Young Registry Services Pty Ltd as share registrar; Reark Research Pty Ltd to conduct qualitative and quantitative research to gauge investor interest; and, lastly, John Singleton Advertising to mount the privatisation advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the appointment and the manner of the appointment of John Singleton which particularly angered me. In addition to John Singleton, three other agencies were asked to pitch for the multimillion dollar account at the last minute. Mojo, the Ball Partnership and Clemenger were asked to present a pitch. Mojo was the holder of the domestic Qantas account and responsible for the I Still Call Australia Home campaign. But it seems that its pitch originally was not considered adequate and so the additional pitches were asked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common factor of the other three is that they all act for political parties&mdash;Ball for the New South Wales Liberal Party; Clemenger for the National Party; and John Singleton for the Australian Labor Party. The contract was worth $15 million. It is open to question as to whether Ball and Clemenger were simply asked to pitch as mere window-dressing before the award was made to Singleton, the holder of the ALP advertising contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known throughout the advertising industry that Clemenger and Ball were asked to pitch in addition to Mojo, but the identity of the other contender&mdash;that is, the successful Singleton tender&mdash;was not disclosed until the eleventh hour. There is evidence to suggest that the losing agencies were even gagged by the government. Those agencies were told not to speak to the media on this matter, and at least one agency could not obtain an answer to the question whether their pitch would even be researched after considerable effort was put into its preparation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have every right to know what steps were taken by the Department of Finance asset sales task force to ensure that a multimillion dollar government contract was not simply handed to a coterie of government mates including John Singleton and his underling, Bob Hogg, who is associated with Mr Singleton. Interestingly enough, a spokesman for the Department of Finance said that the reason those agencies were chosen to pitch was that they were not associated with other airlines. However, just prior to the announcement of the successful tender, the sister of the Prime Minister was added to the board of the Singleton agency. She, of course, has a well-known association with a different airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We now come to another obstacle in the float, the joint services agreement with British Airways. One obstacle to the float which was recently overcome was a draft determination of the Trade Practices Commission on the $1 billion joint services agreement between Qantas and British Airways on scheduling, capacity and pricing of the kangaroo route between Britain and Australia. At the time of the British Airways investment into Qantas, the Trade Practices Commission was assured that the two airlines would be competitive on the kangaroo route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the commission approved the acquisition. The joint services agreement, however, represented a change of heart on the part of the airlines and, after an application had been made to the commission to approve the agreement, a draft determination was issued against the airlines. In what could be seen as the first attempt at government intervention in a decision of the Trade Practices Commission for 15 years, Ministers Willis, Beazley, Brereton and Lee wrote to the commission urging a different final determination on the issue on the grounds of the impact of the value of the float. Obviously, the government believed that cash for the Treasury coffers was of greater public benefit than any prevention of price fixing to the possible detriment of the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that approval of the deal could bring in an extra $250 million for the float. I suppose Labor would call that $250 million worthy of public benefit. If it had been used to retire part of our outstanding international debt, maybe you could argue that way; but to use it as recurrent expenditure, to spend it as quickly as it is received, is simply a waste and a travesty of the privatisation process. On 12 May 1995 the commission handed down its final determination to allow the agreement to run for five years upon certain conditions, after which the airlines must reapply for approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to look specifically at the foreign ownership decision. The joint lead managers for the float, Potter Warburg and McIntosh Securities, which have now been joined by Salomon Brothers, reportedly made representations to the government several months ago to raise the foreign ownership limit in Qantas. It was thought that there was an apparent lack of investor demand for the 65 per cent of stock earmarked for local investors and a likely oversubscription of the remaining 10 per cent stake reserved for foreign consumption. The government, with opposition prior knowledge, announced in the budget that the foreign ownership limit would be increased from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. It is this decision which is the subject of the bill that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 3 of the bill provides that the Qantas Sale Act 1992 is amended according to the schedules set out. Item 1 of the schedule increases the foreign ownership limit in Qantas from 35 per cent of issued capital to 49 per cent. Item 2 restricts the total shareholdings of all foreign airlines combined to no more than 35 per cent of the issued capital in Qantas. Item 3 confirms that the shareholding of any one foreign person, including a foreign airline, is limited to 25 per cent of the total share capital. Item 4 transposes certain definitions from the Air Navigation Act 1920 and the International Air Services Commission Act 1992 into the Qantas Sale Act 1992. Item 5 expands the definition of a foreign person to mean either a foreign airline or a person who is not an Australian person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is here that the bilateral agreements become of critical importance. At issue is a matter originally highlighted in the second reading speech for the Qantas Sale Act in 1992&mdash;that is, the preservation of Qantas's operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements, without which Qantas cannot operate as a truly international airline. Legal advice received by the coalition in March on this question was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, there appears to be tacit international agreement that such ownership will not exceed 35%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each national government grants to the other national governments under bi-lateral Air Services Agreements the right to designate an airline(s) to operate scheduled services between specified points in the contracting countries. Universally these Agreements provide that a contracting government has the right to prevent a designated airline from operating the agreed services if it is not satisfied that the airline is substantially owned or effectively controlled by the other governments or its nationals. Thus the nature of these Air Service Agreements make it mandatory that a designated airline, in this case Qantas, be relevantly owned and effectively controlled by Australian interests. If such ownership and control is not maintained Qantas's operating rights under various Air Services Agreements could be jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Air Services Agreements do not establish an across the board figure for allowable foreign ownership in a designated flag carrier, but there appears to be tacit agreement on 35%. These limits may be negotiable, however, as the US has allowed KLM to own 49% of Northwest's stock accompanied by limitations on its voting entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA>The legal advice concluded that there would have to be solid research done and one would have to be satisfied that those agreements were not placed at risk. Since March the best advice is that the due diligence team has considered this question and is satisfied that after the passage of this bill Qantas will still be regarded for the purposes of the bilaterals as substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. As a result of the United States apparent acceptance that the 49 per cent stake of KLM in Northwest Airlines has not destroyed that airline's national status, there is a general acceptance in similar terms for other airlines provided that the majority of board members and senior management are nationals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applying this test to the current bill, it would seem that the requirements for substantial ownership and effective control pursuant to those agreements have been met by Qantas. In addition, the other so-called national interest safeguards of the Qantas Sale Act 1992, which I outlined earlier, including the following two, are maintained: firstly, Qantas's operational base and headquarters are required to remain in Australia; and, secondly, at least two-thirds of the Qantas board are required to be Australian citizens. The chairman of the board is required to be an Australian citizen as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is well to note that this issue was discussed at the most recent International Civil Aviation Organisation conference last year. The official report of the conference is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Conference concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a)In their air services agreements States usually retain the right, the use of which is optional, to withhold or revoke the operating permit of an air carrier if it is not satisfied that the carrier is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by nationals of the designating party or by the party itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b)There was broad support for the need to review this traditional ownership and control requirement in order that carriers could broaden potential sources of investment and that States be given greater opportunities to participate meaningfully in international air transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c)The option of broadening the ownership and control criteria to one or more States parties to an agreement or their nationals as well as the variant of an air carrier owned and controlled by nationals or by one or more other States which were part of a pre-defined group with a "community of interest" should be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d)The option of using a criterion based on "headquarters, central administration or principal place of business", regardless of ownership and control received some support but was not acceptable to most delegations, mainly because it was regarded as an unacceptable means of gaining market access; differing interpretations of the terms involved could subject it to abuse; and it might lead to "flags of convenience" with lack of regulatory control and social "dumping", although it was recognised in this connection that the Chicago Convention confers responsibility for safety regulation on the State of registry.</PARA>
<PARA>Commercial reality may dictate the future of what constitutes substantial ownership and effective control of an airline by its nationals or, indeed, whether or not this will remain the determining definition. However, at present the requirement for substantial ownership and effective control remains the test as to whether bilateral agreements are honoured. These agreements are fundamental to the business and viability of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is theoretically open to a party to one of Australia's around 3,000 agreements to repudiate an agreement on the basis of increased foreign ownership breaching the national ownership/control test. On the material set out above, it is considered that this is unlikely to occur. In the view of Qantas, it will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this bill, but this decision not to oppose is not to be construed that we are political conscripts of the government's decision. My conviction for privatisation is manifest, but the success or failure of the government's Qantas float is solely the responsibility of the government. The aim of privatisation for us is to have a broader spread of ownership and to see that the proceeds are used for the retirement of debt and not for recurrent purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make it quite clear. The only reason the government is increasing the foreign ownership limit in Qantas is to generate extra cash for its pretend budget surplus. Qantas, quite simply, is being used as kindling to cook the books. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate to hear some of the opposition's contributions in this debate on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. The opposition seems to want to find reasons why the government should not privatise Qantas, to find what it thinks are flaws in the process or to generally talk down the process. It is unfortunate to hear these things now when we go back to what the opposition said some years ago. In 1989, when my colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was the spokesman on aviation matters, the opposition's answer to micro-economic reform was to sell the government owned airlines&mdash;Australian Airlines and Qantas&mdash;outright in a $7 billion garage sale during its first term of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the people were awake to the opposition then and it did not get to do that. But it did not learn much. Again on 4 April 1991 the opposition demanded that the government fully privatise Qantas. The government has said over time that it was looking at selling part of Qantas. It is now selling the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even after the opposition in 1989 and 1991 said that we had to get rid of Qantas quick smart, in the House yesterday the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) derided the sale of assets, claiming that they were swindles and one-offs to make the year's bottom line look a little better. We heard the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) say somewhat similar things a few moments ago. What for the opposition was going to be a fire sale after the 1990 election is now, in a process that the government has looked at sensibly, a swindle and an attempt to make the bottom line look a little better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is a little miffed that we have decided to sell Qantas before it had a chance to do so. After more than a decade of pork-barrelling promises by the opposition, all of which were to be funded by asset sales, it must be a real smack in the face for the coalition's economic geniuses, who must now, in the upcoming election process, resort to due and proper funding processes in funding any promises they make to the electorate. We will probably still hear them saying that, if they are elected after the next election, Telecom will be sold to pay for everything that they promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the government and the opposition in how things have been done is that we have planned sensibly. The honourable member for Forrest and others have rightly pointed out that this sale has been on the books of the government for a number of years. But the mischief in the opposition is that it fails to state that, firstly, the revenue from this sale has never been included in budget figures until this year, except as projections for out years, and that, secondly, this is not a fire sale. Unlike the opposition's proposal, this was a careful, deliberate policy move by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government deferred the finalisation of the float to ensure a maximum return to the public purse. We heard the honourable member for Mackellar say earlier in this debate that it was shocking that the government was trying to maximise the sale price of Qantas and not using the proceeds to retire debt or something like that. It was all right for the opposition in earlier years to fund all sorts of shonky election promises with fire sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition also conveniently forgets that in 1988 Qantas and Australian Airlines urged the government to float as a means of acquiring the required capital to enable them to remain competitively placed in the market. In response to the government's announcement in 1991 of its intention to float a total of 49 per cent of the shares in Qantas, the opposition went into its usual reactionary mode and said that we were not doing enough. It called for full privatisation immediately. It always has to go one better. It wants things done quicker and done now. It does not think of what can be got for a public asset; it wants to just get rid of it quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the Qantas government guaranteed losses for that financial year. Most analysts would agree that that probably would have been the dumbest thing that anyone could have done in 1991. At that time, honourable members might recall that, following deregulation, the pilots dispute and the downturn in tourism from the Gulf War, Qantas was haemorrhaging at $1 million per day. It foreshadowed a loss of $350 million that year, possibly bowing out to half a billion dollars in the following financial year. The opposition said that we ought to have privatised the lot then. It just shows the business aptitude of these so-called captains of industry opposite. The problem with the opposition in the House of Representatives is that it contains the dregs of the business world who cannot find jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than sell at a time when the share price probably would not have even got off the floor, the government's policy was to manage the float in such a way that we would get a good return on the people's investment. The government managed Qantas over those years to ensure that it turned the $376 million loss of 1992-93 into a $156 million profit last year. Even the economic gurus on the opposition side might realise that one gets a far better share price for a business that is making a $150 million profit than one that has turned in a $376 million loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half yearly results to December, which were announced in March this year, were $128 million&mdash;an increase of 79 per cent on the same period last year. So the government is going into this float with the profitability of Qantas being about the best it has ever been, which will attract quite a premium for the sale of the business. The targets the government's plan outlined in 1991 and 1992, when the government announced that Qantas had acquired Australian Airways, were correct. In December 1992 the cabinet approved the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Qantas to British Airways in an attempt to ensure that Qantas became more integrated into the world market and had on-carriage rights and better facilities for passengers in the European market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at a map of the airline schedulings of the world, we see that a fit with Qantas and BA is a very useful fit for a medium sized airline like Qantas. The distribution of British Airways around the world is Europe, Africa and parts of north Asia, but it is very light in the area of the world where we have a very substantial part of the business. So the synergies between Qantas and British Airways are very good for Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt my colleagues who follow me will tell us that there would be a better fit with Thai International or an airline like that, but I really think the fit with Qantas and BA is a good one. Some might argue that Lufthansa, as an airline of the same size, might have been a better arrangement, but I think the synergies that Qantas gets with having British Airways as a partner are both good for Australian travellers and good for Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we sold that 25 per cent stake in Qantas to British Airways we also said we intended to sell the other 75 per cent at the end of 1993. The government changed that schedule from 1993-94 to the 1994-95 financial year to take advantage of what we expected was an upturn of the economy and in the travelling public. That decision the government made has been shown to be a very smart one. Improvements in the financial performance of Qantas are expected to continue, given the management's focus on increased profitability, notably through exploiting the synergies with British Airways I mentioned before; the application of greater controls over costs; and improved efficiencies in utilisation of aircraft&mdash;for example, purchasing of larger capacity aircraft, which both maximises passenger potential and minimises noise emanations around the airports of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I believe really annoys the opposition is that the government has managed to float Qantas so well. It ensured Qantas was in a strong market position to maximise the potential returns to the taxpayers in this float. Today's bill changes those arrangements only at the margins, but these are very important changes because they will improve the position of Qantas in the float by allowing foreign investors in total to acquire up to 49 per cent of Qantas, but any particular foreign entity will be restricted to 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This brings the foreign ownership in line with the limitations for other Australian carriers and places Qantas in a competitive position in the market. While that limitation of 25 per cent for any foreign owner is not set out in the Air Navigation Act, the government's aviation policy requires that other airlines seeking to become designated international carriers comply with bilateral agreement requirements, which is that they be substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Air Navigation Act such carriers are required to meet various national interest criteria. Those criteria include: at least two-thirds of the board members being Australian citizens; the chairperson of the board being an Australian citizen; the airline's operational base being in Australia; and relevant interest by foreign airlines individually not exceeding 25 per cent or in aggregate not exceeding 35 per cent of the total value of the issued share capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Air Navigation Act imposes no overall limitation on holdings by foreigners, other than by foreign airlines. But, if foreign holdings moved above 49 per cent, international carrier status could be challenged by Australia's bilateral partners on the grounds that the carrier may no longer be seen as a substantially Australian owned and controlled entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) stated earlier, the government believes it is desirable that Qantas be subjected to the same foreign ownership regime that applies to Ansett and other potential Australian and international airlines. With this legislation and this program of privatising Qantas, we want to place on the Australian market a large corporation which will be very viable and will not have regulatory or legislative impositions on it any different from those imposed on other players in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national interest provisions of the bill remain unchanged and set individual foreign holdings at a maximum of 25 per cent. These changes in foreign ownership limitation mean that Qantas will be able to access additional demand from international equity markets, which will be good for the Qantas share price. With these changes to foreign ownership, Qantas can take full advantage of that offshore demand. The changes to the foreign ownership limits will mean that Qantas will attract a better value, and that is in the interests of the Australian taxpayers who own this business. The government has done all it can to ensure that Qantas is a viable player in the international transport game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas should go to the market looking to the future as a very viable and successful Australian commercial operation. It should not be looking to the past, to its previous incarnation as a government business enterprise. In some of the statements made by Qantas executives you see this hankering for the good old days of being a GBE. That is a very regrettable situation. Qantas has to understand that when it is freed from public ownership there will not be any more free rides. It will be competing in the market and the government should not be giving it any more of an edge than it gives to any other business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this harking back, wanting to have the best of both worlds. Recently, Qantas has said that the government should give it some undertaking that it should never have to fly into Sydney West airport. It feels it should be a protected species and that Sydney West should be the airport that other airlines use. It says the government should do that for it because Qantas is the government's airline. But it is not the government's airline. Qantas wants to be set free&mdash;it wanted to be set free in 1988&mdash;and the government is now setting it free. Once it is set free it will be out there in the market and cannot have that sort of guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the Managing Director of Qantas, James Strong, declared that Qantas would not expand its operation to Badgerys Creek. Mr Strong said that Badgerys Creek was not a viable option for Qantas, although it was fine for others to move out there. If you talk to Qantas executives privately, they are saying we should force the others to move out there. They are saying that Sydney airport should be the airport for Qantas and maybe Ansett while everyone else&mdash;the other international operators, commuter airlines and charter operators&mdash;should be forced out to Sydney West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas says that it wants to have a special status&mdash;it is an Australian company and the government used to own it. Qantas has made some bad mistakes in the past when it was a government entity. It put all its eggs in the one basket with Sydney airport. It was never willing to accept that Sydney airport had a shelf life and that there needed to be expansion somewhere else. With the expansion of traffic into Sydney, and with the expansion of international traffic into Australia, Sydney airport is not going to become Qantas international airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas will have to, as will other operators, move out and take advantage of Sydney West airport. It is no good for Qantas, once it is privatised, to expect the special deals it was able to get when it was a government entity. The market is there. Qantas has to meet it and should be able to succeed in that market. The government has given Qantas as much assistance as it could along the way to support the share price. Qantas will now have to look to the future as a fully privatised Australian business; it will have to share the perils and the profits from doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas cannot keep carping and harping on about special deals and saying that if it does not get special deals it will have to shed staff or it may have to have its work done overseas. Qantas cannot, on the one hand, say that the government ought to help it because it is a good Australian corporation and then, on the other hand, say, `If you do not help us, we will shed staff, we will move some of our maintenance operations offshore, or we will start to source things elsewhere.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas has found that the biggest selling points it has are its safety record and the fact that it is Australia's international airline. Its own research shows that, if it steps away from that concept of Australianness, its selling position in the market is going to deteriorate. Why would you go on Qantas and pay full fare if Thai International, or one of the other international operators that tend to act more as foreign exchange earners for their governments than as airline businesses, can sell you a cheaper fare?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this bill to the House. In doing so, I say to Qantas executives that what we want to see Qantas become is an active Australian corporation looking to the future and putting behind it its GBE days. We want to see it go out there and make a profit which will be good for it, and provide an airline service which will be good for all Australians. </PARA>

My suggestion to the honourable member for Watson would be that next time Qantas goes to him with that line he ought to tell it to do some homework on what the traffic to the western suburbs of Sydney is. It might find out that already there is enough traffic going into Sydney international daily that would justify five services a week from Melbourne and three services a week from Brisbane&mdash;and that is before we even start.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is not to say that there is no future for Kingsford Smith airport. The reality is that we will need two airports. The reality is that the population is moving westward. The reality is that anybody who is going to make a dollar out of the airline business ultimately will have to have some sort of operation at Sydney West airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill&mdash;as I think somebody mentioned this morning&mdash;has probably had more comebacks than Dame Nellie Melba. For five years we have been looking forward to the day when we finally get the Qantas sale off the books. The honourable member for Watson made reference to what the opposition had proposed in 1989. My suggestion is that, had we been in power in those days, many of the difficulties that Australia and Australian aviation have struck since that time would not have been in existence. I very much doubt that we would have had the disastrous 1989 pilots dispute. I very much doubt that we would have had the downturn in the economy that we experienced in those times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation of Qantas and Australian Airlines should have been undertaken many years ago because privatisation is not only about selling off the silver; it is about getting efficiencies into the operations; it is about the major convergence from a government instrumentality into a private operation and the resultant efficiencies that can be brought about. It would have meant a major change in the nature and philosophy of Australian airlines. We needed that change for the reasons mentioned by the honourable member for Watson. We had this old GBE attitude that what is good for Qantas is good for Australia. I am afraid that was not necessarily so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years later, once this legislation is passed, we can see the benefits in an operational sense that the privatisation of Qantas might be able to bring about. The privatisation of Qantas will be a momentous occasion for the Australian money markets. I congratulate the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) for her reading of the government's aims in the privatisation of Qantas. She has mentioned what the government intends to do with the proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly correct that, apart from the operational efficiencies that one can get from a privatised entity, one of the things we should have been looking at was retiring the debt with the proceeds of the sale. That is not to be. We have to ensure that, once Qantas is privatised, the country can benefit. In her contribution, the honourable member for Mackellar went, chapter and verse, through some of the difficulties that could have resulted from the government's decision just prior to the last election to increase the foreign ownership of Qantas to 49 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in past years there have been difficulties with foreign shareholdings for some overseas carriers. Interestingly enough, British Airways was one of those companies that suffered in the United States. After privatisation it was found that British Airways had a foreign shareholding of 39 per cent. The American carriers said that British Airways was not a British entity if it had that sort of shareholding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brought into focus that particular piece of folklore within the airline industry that 35 per cent foreign ownership is the ultimate maximum. However, we then saw disastrous times. We saw those huge seas of red ink coming out of the American aviation industry. We saw the near collapse of some of America's major carriers, including North West and Continental. We saw European carriers come into the industry in America. We saw KLM go into North West and we saw the Scandinavian Airline System buy into Continental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In true American tradition, all that went out the window when the 49 per cent situation was reached. It has now virtually become the accepted norm within the international airline industry. Hopefully, that particular position is covered by having the 35 per cent limit in the legislation. If there are advantages in having a greater foreign holding, we are covered by the 49 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other aspects in the lead-up to this legislation that I would like to raise. My colleague the honourable member for Mackellar made particular reference to the situation of the Trade Practices Commission and its draft determination of the joint services agreement between Qantas and British Airways on the kangaroo route. I will not go into all that again, except to say that I thought Professor Fels had some very pertinent points to make in his initial finding. The reality of this delay in the privatisation of Qantas has meant that Australian aviation has not necessarily been able to develop to its full potential in the last five years; the Australian travelling public has not necessarily had the full benefits of privatisation and the open competition that could have been brought about if privatisation had occurred earlier; and inbound tourism operators did not necessarily have the best result for their operations as a result of the delays. In his determination Professor Fels highlighted one thing: he was concerned that, with the tie-in between British Airways and Qantas on the kangaroo route, we would see a lack of competitive force on that route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fact may or may not have been right. The kangaroo route is the most competitive in the world in terms of price. I rang a couple of travel agents before I came in here today and found that the price for a return trip to London at the moment varies between $1,650 and $2,800. So there are some fairly competitive price forces involved there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Fels was right to point out the possibility of losing some of these competitive forces if this move was allowed to go ahead unchallenged. My concern is that it may not be the kangaroo route which gets the collusion in the future but some of the other routes to and from Australia if we allow a situation to develop where one carrier can virtually control the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all comes about through this process called code sharing. Code sharing has always been fairly well developed in the United States, and we are seeing more and more of it here at the moment. It is fairly obvious that the Qantas-British Airways tie-in is going to allow for a lot of code sharing because you are not just talking about two airlines but a number of airlines. You are talking about the British Airways arrangements with US Air in the United States, with TAT in France, with Deutsche BA in Germany, and with a number of other minor carriers with which they have affiliations. We always have to be vigilant so the Australian travelling public, and those travelling to Australia, will not be disadvantaged if we get those cosy arrangements with a combination of those airlines that go typically under the expression `code sharing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in the United States at the moment is quite interesting. If you go into a travel agent there and book on, say, Continental for an overseas trip, you could well find yourself flying on Air Canada, Air France, SAS, Alitalia, or some other carrier. If you book on United, you may find yourself travelling on Lufthansa, Thai Airways International, Transbrasil, British Midland or ALM Dutch Antillean airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you book on Delta, which is an interesting one because it has a cross-share arrangement with Singapore Airlines and Swiss Air, you might find yourself travelling on any one of those three airlines but you could also be travelling on Malev, Aeroflot, Vietnam Airlines, Varig, Swissair, Sabena, Austrian, TAP&mdash;Air Portugal&mdash;or Virgin Atlantic. Basically, you are getting a situation where these combinations, under the title of code shares, are being used to allow airlines to go into markets where maybe they have not operated before. It also gives them a chance to bump up the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody would deny that, in terms of the earning capacity of international airlines, things have been pretty tight in the last few years. We have seen some enormous losses in recent times. In one year alone in North America, the airlines lost more money than they had made in the whole period since World War II. So nobody would deny the fact that the airlines have to get their efficiencies into place, but you also have to be careful that you do not get rid of that competitive force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read a report by Paul Dempsey, the director of the transportation law program at the University of Denver, who is the author of a number of books as well as the president of the consumer advocacy  group Americans for a Sound Aviation Policy. He aligned the whole business of code sharing with the expression `P.T. Barnum lives'. Of course, you will remember that Mr Barnum, well-known American business mogul, was once renowned for his assertion: `There is a sucker born every minute.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dempsey claims that this getting together of the airlines has resulted in consumer fraud, which is just pure and simple fraud and very anti-competitive. In the case of the United States, that could well be true. The fact that Professor Fels, and his particular organisation, has given only a five-year guarantee to this agreement between British Airways and Qantas is a good example. I sincerely hope that the Trade Practices Commission will also monitor some of the other activities on some of those other routes to and from Australia over these coming years to make sure that people who use our airlines do not miss out on some of that competitive pricing and that our international tourism effort is not jeopardised simply because we have been able to bump up the fares so quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that there have been a number of areas in which the Australian travelling public has missed out because of the delays in the privatisation of Qantas. Another area of particular concern to me which has been raised in this House on a number of occasions is that agreement with the New Zealand government to open up the trans-Tasman services and to have an open skies operation between here and New Zealand and around the Pacific Rim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many pluses for Australia in that arrangement. It was not, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said, all Air New Zealand's way. It was not only an opportunity for Australians to benefit from the results of opening up that system but was also certainly a great opportunity to open up the South Pacific. We know that the real reason the government reneged on that proposition with New Zealand was simply to try to bolster the Qantas float. I hope that, once this float is out of the way, we can see an open slather arrangement across the Tasman and the opening up of this part of the world, because the benefits to tourism, foreign exchange earnings and job creation will be tremendous, not only for Australia and New Zealand but also for many of the small island states that are there. I think the excuses made by the minister were quite dreadful at the time and did no good for our international status as a major aviation player. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area in which I think we have suffered has been in the area of charter policy. In 1990, the government made a determination and changed the charter regime with another review that was due for 1994. The review was done 12 months ago. The results and recommendations of that review went to the minister. We have heard no more of it since. We are not likely to hear much of it, obviously because there might be a chance to undermine the value of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that the world is much bigger than this extra $250 million that the government may or may not get out of the Qantas float. I hope that one of the things the minister will do very soon is to make sure that he releases the result of that study into charter policy, and I hope he will pick up on some of its recommendations, which, I understand, are there to give us a more liberal regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the great difficulties that we have in Australia are that we are at the end of the line and we are at the end of some long, thin routes. Charter policy is certainly one way in which we can build up international traffic into Australia, if we do it properly. Unfortunately, there has been almost an obsession by this government with the privatisation of Qantas, with consequent delays, which has probably been quite detrimental to Australian aviation and to the future growth of the Australian tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson made a statement that amused me. He was talking about the fit into the international air routes that Qantas and British Airways may be able to bring about. He said that he thought that was very good for Qantas and for the Australian travelling public. I believe that it probably will be. Let me say this: it is much better for British Airways and for the British travelling public. One thing that I think we have to be very aware of is the history of British Airways and its capacity to take over a market. It is quite interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once that privatisation is through, we are going to be dealing with a pretty tough customer. Take a look at British Airways and its history with airlines like British Caledonian Airways and Dan Air, and at the ongoing court cases with Virgin Atlantic at the moment. Bear in mind that Virgin Atlantic will soon be coming on the Australian route and that Mr Branson from Virgin Atlantic Airlines has won, I think, something like #860 million so far from British Airways in his challenges in the court. We will be dealing with one of the largest aviation groups in the world. We do not want ourselves to be totally swamped with a mentality in Qantas that big is absolutely beautiful and that everything it says must be taken as holy writ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in this fit we will be able, through bodies like the Trade Practices Commission, to have a capacity to monitor what is going on so that the advantages that this particular privatisation process and the arrangement with British Airways can bring will not mean that Australian aviation will not have the capacity to be fully developed and will not have the capacity to maximise the effects on the fare paying passengers of Australia and those inbound tourists who want to come to Australia. We want to make sure that they can still do it efficiently, but we also want to make sure that they can do it at the right price. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 November 1992 in a second reading speech, the then Minister for Finance, the member for Gellibrand, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These safeguards&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which include the 35 per cent foreign ownership&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are important to maintain the basic Australian character of Qantas, as well as to ensure that Qantas's operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not put under threat. Once in legislation, these safeguards will not be subject to the whim of the Government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA>As has been noted by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and others, the question must now be asked: why was it that in 1992 the 35 per cent rule was vital, essential and necessary to maintaining the character of Qantas as an Australian airline and yet in 1995 the figure has mysteriously blown out to 49 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in his erudite speech a few minutes ago pointed out to us the problems that other airlines such as British Airways had when they expanded their foreign ownership beyond the level of 35 per cent. The government must be accountable to the people of  Australia for its proposal in this legislation to blow out foreign ownership from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. With the 3,000-odd international agreements relating to air travel, is Qantas now in jeopardy at 49 per cent foreign ownership of losing its essential Australian character? Will all of those agreements entered into by Australia with other nations be at risk? Will Qantas, instead of being a company which a lot of people want to buy, become a shell party to agreements which become absolutely worthless?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government has not looked into this matter sufficiently. The government has been motivated by the need to cook the books. The government has been motivated by the need to produce a more acceptable budget night figure. The government has also been motivated largely by the desire to produce this artificial, fraudulent $780 million budget surplus claimed by the Treasurer on budget night. During question time on days succeeding the budget, even the Treasurer could not keep a straight face when talking about a budget surplus. He knows, as we know, the reality is that there is an $8.2 billion budget deficit. When the Treasurer was answering questions, he stumbled over words. He referred to a budget deficit rather than a budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been entirely inconsistent. Not only were comments made by the Treasurer in 1992, but as recently as February this year a spokeswoman for the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the 35 per cent ceiling on overseas shareholdings in Qantas stood firm and no plans existed to change the parameters written into the sale legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>If this report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is accurate, then in the space of 11 or 12 weeks the government has obviously decided to turn the finance minister into a person who is deliberately economical with the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the finance minister or his spokesperson said 11 or 12 weeks ago&mdash;namely, that the 35 per cent ceiling remained as of May 1995&mdash;is not the truth. The government has again changed its mind on this issue. The government has again broken its word, in the way that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has junked the tax cuts proposed and announced prior to the last election. We all know, and the people of Australia who are listening to this debate today know, that the l-a-w tax cuts became the l-i-e deception. It has meant that the Prime Minister's word has become w-o-r-t-h-l-e-s-s, absolutely worthless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the government's about-face in relation to the increase in the proportion of foreign ownership of Qantas to be permitted pursuant to this bill is obvious. It is a desperate attempt by a desperate government which knows that it is going to be decimated at the polls to pull a rabbit out of the hat to make the people of Australia believe that it  has been more fiscally and financially responsible than it has.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, on this side of the House, very strongly support the principle of the privatisation of Qantas Airways. We do not believe that the government should be running airlines. We do not believe that the government should be running banks. We believe that it is appropriate that the Australian people should be given the opportunity to buy shares in important Australian enterprises. But, while I support what is actually happening in this legislation, I simply cannot, in any way shape or form, back the rationale behind the government, because I believe that the introduction of these changes in the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1995 seek to perpetrate a fraud on the Australian people, and we on this side of the parliament would certainly never support any fraud on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has claimed that despite the increase in foreign ownership from 35 per cent to 49 per cent Qantas will retain its essential character as an Australian enterprise because it will continue to be incorporated in Australia and it will maintain an operations base and headquarters located in this country. The government also claims that participation of additional foreign investors should help ensure the government attracts full value for Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all a question of words. The government is really admitting here that the increase in foreign ownership of Qantas, Australia's national flag carrier, from 35 per cent to 49 per cent is all about dollars. It is not about what is right and proper. It is not about consistency. It is not about honesty. It is not about decency. It is not about accountability; it is all about money. It is all about the extra $200 million to $300 million which the increase in foreign equity from 35 per cent to 49 per cent will hopefully raise, from the government's point of view, when the float finally takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, I believe, stands condemned by the Australian people for yet again breaking its word. This government in five successive budgets has endeavoured to flog off Australia's national flag carrier. This government has failed to do so. The headlines in the newspaper and community sentiment indicate that this government is going to have a very difficult job in raising the kind of money that it wants to from Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, therefore, has come in in 1995, five budgets after first announcing the sale of Qantas, and wants to change the rules to increase what it expects to get. It has told us that it plans to get between $200 million and $300 million more than it would otherwise get. This change proposed in this bill indicates in another way that the Australian people are not able to accept the word of this government. This indicates that the government is driven by a desperate need to raise funds at all costs&mdash;at the cost of its integrity, at the cost of its policy. I believe that the government will be, in effect, shown up at the next election for what it is&mdash;a government which is not able to tell the truth, a government of dishonesty, a government which continues to perpetrate fraud at the expense of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Summing up, I endorse totally the excellent contribution made by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar. She has pointed out the sordid and shabby motives which have propelled the government to bring this legislation into this place. She has also pointed out the very real dangers which exist to Qantas's future. For $200 million to $300 million, this government is putting at risk the international airline agreements which have given Qantas certain rights because it is considered to be an Australian airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been motivated by the dollars. This government is not motivated by principle. This government, I believe, has absolutely no integrity left. If anyone had any doubt at all, one would only have to look at this legislation and at the government's budget strategy. The government in the budget announced a surplus of $780 million, which everyone agrees was an absolute fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the budget deficit was $8.2 billion. The money which the government proposes to raise from the sale of Qantas has been included in the receipt side of the budget, to create part of this artificial budget surplus of $780 million. It ought to be remembered that last year's asset sales were a flop and, after budgeting for proceeds of $2.4 billion, only $55 million was realised. If the government is no more successful this year than last year&mdash;and there is no indication that the government will be&mdash;its budgeted $5.3 billion in asset sales should read $121.4 million and there will be a shortfall of $5.18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts that I have outlined in the chamber will blow the government's budget strategy right out of the water. The government, in its budget, fudged the figures. It was dishonest. That is why I was very pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition, in his budget response, indicate that in government we will have very many more principles than those opposite, as far as announcing the true situation when Australia's budget is released. I support totally what the honourable member for Mackellar has said; I support totally what my colleague the honourable member for Fadden has said; and I believe that history will record that this is a government of dishonesty, a government of fraud and a government which will stand condemned. It will be swept from office in a very major and very substantial way at the time of the next election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are unprincipled in every way, as my colleague has said. So, instead of standing by the people who established the Australian Labor Party, those opposite will say anything and do anything. The words used privately amongst members of the Labor Party are that nothing is too good for the Australian workers or their representatives, but that certainly has a new meaning when we see the interpretations given to that by this current government. Nothing is too good for the workers' representatives in this place&mdash;the cars, the flights, the staying in office, the selling off of the great icons of Australia. What those opposite do does not seem to matter in the slightest to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on the other side do not have that philosophy and outlook on life, so to contrast our point of view with that of the Australian Labor Party is a simple thing. We believe that Australian Airlines and Qantas are great airlines but they must serve the people. When Bob Hawke first became Prime Minister, he ran Qantas as part of his private fleet. He and Sir Lennox Hewitt expected the best seats and the best treatment from their private airline&mdash;and the best hotels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those days show something of a socialist outlook&mdash;to the winner goes all the prizes and trophies. We on this side feel that private enterprise best serves the people and, through the process of competition, the best results are gained. By competing for that client, that person who wants to fly, better and more prompt services, more attention to detail and better scheduled services will arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is strange today to reflect on what the Australian Labor Party has done with Australia's great airline. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have taken some pleasure, as you would expect me to, in looking back at the record of what the Australian Labor Party has said in this House over the years in regard to Qantas. I go back to 1985 when the coalition was first proposing that some of these government enterprises be moved out of the public sector and set free. I am sure that honourable members and the listeners of parliament will remember that at that time Qantas was begging&mdash;as was Australian Airlines&mdash;for the opportunity to be set free of the bureaucratic controls placed on it by government. Superannuation funds and all sorts of bureaucratic requirements were placed on what should have been private airlines because of the public link they had with the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that period&mdash;from 1985 through to 1990 and the present day&mdash;both those airlines have been limited and restricted by rules and red tape. Their market share and their capacity to compete on the world market have gradually declined over that period. They needed to be set free at that time. They could have gone on the market, raised a lot of money and become profitable, world-class airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Australian Labor Party, clinging to its ideology, has delayed a decision&mdash;an inevitable decision, I would submit&mdash;for approximately five years. The result will be that the Australian people will not receive the full benefits of the sale of Qantas. Much time has been wasted and flitted away while there have been arguments at ALP conferences, within the union movement and with all sorts of people. To refresh the memory of honourable members, let me read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 12 September 1985. This is a speech by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How about the Budget Post Office? Those are the kinds of things that the average Australian can understand. Who could afford to buy the Commonwealth Bank? Who could afford to buy Qantas, other than Saudi Arabian Airlines? Who can afford the kind of investment that these privatisation programs involve?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the previous Government we saw Australia being sold. Land was sold at the rate of one per cent a year to overseas buyers. In the next Liberal Government, if it ever occurs, we will see the sale of Australian industry progressing at a much faster pace. During the Liberals' 35 years in office most of the Australian industry became foreign owned. This Government will ensure that the major instrumentalities of Australia will remain Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>Big joke! Within a few years, all of that turned around. On 23 August 1985, in answer to a question from the then member for Macarthur, now the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), about the possible sale of Qantas Airways, Trans Australia Airlines, the Australian National Line and the Australian National, the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the then Minister for Transport and Minister for Aviation, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the honourable member for his question. Those who talk about privatisation really are trotting out a very tired old piece of ideology which has been around for a long time. It is the usual ploy used by those tired old conservatives opposite.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our short term in office we have brought TAA back to making solid profit figures. Qantas is making a record profit.</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANL has been brought back from bankruptcy to paying dividends for the first time in 14 years.</PARA>
<PARA>We have Neville Wran trying to pull together the ANL mess. Goodness me, you guys do not deserve to be in office. What a shambles you have created while in government in Australia. You really believed all these statements, but you had no intention of carrying them out. Mr Peter Morris concluded his answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one way to summarise all this talk about privatisation. Privatisation is really the supreme con job. The Opposition is really saying: `Let us sell to the people something that they already own'. It is a supreme con job&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The government is not even selling it to Australians. The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill proposes that we lift the foreign ownership of Qantas from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. The government has not even got the decency to pretend that it is going to sell it to Australians. I cannot believe the Australian Labor Party in what we are hearing today in the parliament with regard to the sale of Qantas. Further, in 1987 the member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) made a statement in the House on a matter of public importance. It might enlighten the House to hear what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What about the Opposition's privatisation policies? It wants to sell off the assets of the Australian public. What will it sell Telecom Australia for&mdash;$7? Do I hear $8? What about Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, or perhaps the Commonwealth Bank of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>He was being cynical here, was he not? What a cynical government the Australian Labor Party is. The member continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we are talking big bikkies. Let us look at last year's profits of the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;the people's bank; the big Australian bank. It had a 55 per cent profit increase.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is selling the Commonwealth Bank after all of that talk. The legislation before us proposes the sale of Qantas. It was a slow process getting to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to statements made by the former chairman of Qantas in 1992, Mr Bill Dix. He said that he would have to indicate that he believed that 48 per cent&mdash;which was the amount being spoken about at that time&mdash;foreign ownership of Qantas would raise in excess of $1 billion. In an interview on 11 March 1992, Mr Dix said that he believed the asset sales task force would resolve the situation by raising $1 billion for Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Qantas Sale Bill, which was introduced in November 1992, sought to sell Qantas in three stages, to impose conditions on the articles of association of the private company and to allow certain financial transactions by the Commonwealth to facilitate the sale. The details of the sale were announced by the government in 1991. In February 1992 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered the One Nation statement which contained modifications to aviation policy and the proposed sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a period of approximately four years, the government has played with the idea of selling Qantas, even though one of the great icons, one of the great traditions of the Labor Party of Australia, is that the government and the people should own these things. The irony of this situation is that the government has been hypocritical in every election. Remember when the Prime Minister bagged John Hewson in the countdown to the last election about whether Hewson's word could be trusted with respect to introducing legislation for the goods and services tax? This government has introduced legislation after legislation which restricts foreign ownership of Qantas airlines. Again, we are changing that today. We are raising the foreign ownership of Qantas from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The talk is that Qantas will basically become an out-station of British Airways and that we will have the flying kangaroo but it will not really be Australian any more. The Australian Labor Party has said to the Australian people at election after election, `We are truly patriotic. We really believe that Australians are good. We believe that we can run the nation properly.' How many Australians really understand what the government has done to some of our great assets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to disclose the way the government has sold Australian assets over the last few years. In 1991 the government said that it was going to sell $1 billion worth of Australian government assets. It sold $161 million. In 1991-92 it was going to sell $625 million worth of Australian government assets. It sold about half of that amount&mdash;$301 million. But, on each occasion, the budget looked good to the Australian people because the government estimated that it would sell assets of this worth. The government said, `Yes, on this side we're going to spend so much but on the other side we're going to sell so much so that things will look all right when you rule off the bottom line of the budget.' From 1991 until now, the government has sold Australian assets. Now we are on the last two assets: Qantas is the second last one and the Commonwealth Bank is still to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what would happen to the Australian people&mdash;and I do not believe that they are foolish&mdash;should they happen to vote the Labor Party back next year, because there will be nothing left to sell. It will have sold everything within the period it will have been in office. It will have sold everything, got rid of it. The cupboard will be bare. And in what way will Australians have benefited from it? You have had record sales of assets, record unemployment, record inflation, record bankruptcies&mdash;record everything that is bad&mdash;and you have sold the lot in order to make that continue to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people will come to the year 1995-96 and see that the budget says the government is going to sell $5.3 billion worth of assets&mdash;that is what you say you are going to sell. Given your track record&mdash;which indicates that you have not sold nearly that amount, but you are doing it to make the outturn look good&mdash;it is no wonder that the Westpac Bank in its bulletin, in its post budget summary of what the government has done, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1995-96 Budget: too little, too late</PARA>
<PARA>It particularly talks about the budget surplus being `achieved with smoke and mirrors'. It states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the period 1992-93 to 1993-94, the Government brought down a succession of fiscal packages designed to stimulate the economy, which injected in a full year just over $6bn into the economy. In this Budget, $2.6bn (worth 0.5% of GDP) of that stimulus has been taken back and that is a more accurate assessment of the real degree to which fiscal policy has been tightened</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Genuine structural tightening should have been undertaken in last year's Budget. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Westpac goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has projected a surplus&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in this budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of $0.7 billion. However, this seemingly attractive "headline" surplus relies on $5bn of extra asset sales which we define broadly to include equivalents such as early debt repayments by states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Altogether there will be $7.5 billion of asset sales in 1995-96, hence the underlying deficit is more like $6.7bn.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have one of our great banks just saying, `Well, the deficit is really bad; it is really $6.7 billion because the government is insisting on including in the budget sales of organisations such as Qantas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that we will see the day when Qantas really does flourish, because I do not believe that it will flourish while the shackles are on it. It is a shame that the ideology and short-sightedness of the Labor Party has kept it restricted to the degree that it has. All that period we have talked about, during which we had ideological claptrap going on in the parliament while the government was preparing to sell Qantas, just delayed the issue until the fateful day, with Qantas being so weakened that one wonders whether it will ever make a recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the highlights of this legislation&mdash;and one has to wonder at a government being so crass as to have this included in its legislation or needing to have this included in its legislation&mdash;for an Australian airline, owned by Australians but in fact funded by foreigners, is the inclusion of certain things so that we can be sure that Qantas really has a token, a shell, of Australian respectability. Included in this legislation, despite the fact that Qantas is going to be 49 per cent owned by foreigners, is that the operational base and headquarters of Qantas will remain in Australia. The government has to put that in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister bagging John Hewson about whether or not he could legislate food out of a goods and services tax, and this government is legislating that an airline's headquarters are to be in Australia.

That is the degree of patriotism that the Labor Party has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the government has in this legislation that the name of Qantas will be preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services. Is that not good? Nobody is going to be able to make it the cathay&mdash;in little print&mdash;qantas airline, or the british airlines&mdash;little letters&mdash;qantas airlines. The routes are going to retain the name Qantas, and the legislation says so. How long before the government changes that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about this one: the chairman of the board will be an Australian. As we move to greater control by people who are non-Australians, how long will it be before they insist that the little shareholders of Australian holdings in Qantas do not need to be recognised and that there should be some international person appointed as chairman of the board of Qantas? What about this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directors be provided with broad powers, including the power to deny registration or to force the disposal of shares held by foreigners to ensure foreign ownership limits are not breached.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen the government do that time and again with the media. We have seen the way in which it has been prepared to deny citizenship rules for Rupert Murdoch. We have seen the way it has been prepared to change foreign ownership in the media to use it as a toy, to present it as a token of its patronage and support, its patriotism for this country, its real belief that the media should be owned by Australia. Here we have similar provisions in the Qantas bill. How long will it be before the government changes these?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been over the government's record for the last 10 years. In 10 years it has proved that it does not believe in anything, that it does not stand for anything, that it will change any of its ideology or belief if it means it will stay in office. Despite all of the protestations about how good and how well managed it has been, one speaker for the Australian Labor Party has presented this as a good decision and a decision in Australia's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, it is a good decision. It is five or six years too late. The government is doing it the wrong way. It has had to pull in foreign interests because of the way it has so mucked up the sale of Qantas. At the end of the day, it has had to write into the legislation so the government is believable that the chairman has to remain an Australian, that the headquarters have to be in Australia and the directors have some power to control foreign interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments will be short. The whole essence of the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill that we have discussed today is to increase the foreign ownership of Qantas from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. As the speakers for the opposition have clearly shown, it is the government's intent to raise that ownership for a single reason and a single reason only; that is, to get its hands on more cash quicker so it may spend the cash to try to give some legitimacy to its budget that is going through the House now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply put on the record that the whole attitude of the government and the opposition to privatisation is an entirely different philosophical one. The first aim of privatising business rests with the ability of the private sector to provide the same goods and services more efficiently and effectively, including allowing for any special objectives for community service obligations. Secondly, it should be used for the reduction of public sector indebtedness. Again and again, members on this side have made that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason is to expand the number of Australians who are investing in Australia. In this way we can increase private savings in a vehicle which is different from the government's very narrow vehicle of compulsory superannuation. We can allow Australians to participate in ownership of companies which are truly government owned in the sense that the government is the one who presently is the beneficiary, not the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say in these comments that, although we are not opposing this bill, our philosophy behind privatisation is entirely different from that which motivates the government. The government is motivated simply to expose Qantas, in this case, to greater foreign ownership because otherwise it would have less money to put towards its so-called surplus in the budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity, in speaking in the budget debate for this year, to raise my profound concerns about the forestry industry in Australia. For some time I have felt increasing concern at what I see as the rape of our scarce natural forest resources for short-term economic benefits to forestry companies. My concern is that, by subsidising forestry activities, including woodchipping in native forests, we are all on the one hand destroying the heritage of future generations whilst on the other hand retarding the development of unsubsidised plantations. This, of course, creates a vicious circle where it is argued that there are not enough plantation sawlogs and pulpwood to allow us to stop logging and woodchipping in native forests. I want to deal with these arguments in more detail in a few moments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent the seat of Makin in South Australia. In our state, the Dunstan Labor government ended logging of native forests in the 1970s. We are the only state to have done so. We are also the only state where a viable timber industry relies wholly on plantations for its survival. As with other states, we have timber towns, timber corporations, log trucking companies, about 3,500 timber and forestry workers, paper and pulp mills, sawmills, laminating factories and lumber companies. None of these industries or jobs relies on product from native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia in this instance provides what is obviously a model for what should have happened across Australia over the past 20 years or so. We should have moved to plantation timber chip and pulp production in all states. It is a shame on past and present state governments that the move to plantations did not take place nationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, with no logging occurring in native forests in South Australia, my constituents, as Australian citizens, have little time for the continued forestry in native forests in other parts of Australia. During the recent public outcry over woodchip export licences, I did not hear from one constituent supporting the logging industry. On the contrary, the voices expressed that, if 100 per cent of plantation sources was okay in South Australia, they should be, likewise, used interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is my strongly held view that logging and woodchipping in native forests should be phased out forthwith and replaced with plantation feedstock. I realise that the Australian government cannot enforce such a policy except at the margin through export licences, for example, as we do not have constitutional power and we do not own the native forests. The constitutional power over land management and the ownership of the native forests is regrettably in the hands of the state governments. Because of this situation, I have sympathy for the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, who on the one hand faces demands to stop the rape of the forests but on the other hand has no effective power to halt the destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, economic realities and environmental imperatives are starting to impact on the recalcitrant states. The Carr government in New South Wales, newly elected, has made clear its intention to stop logging of native forests. Pressure must now be put on Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia to move quickly to plantation stock and follow the example given by New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Needless to say, forestry interests will fight to the death to preserve their access to native forests. They will do so for as long as the cost of logs and chips from these forests is subsidised by state governments which fail to charge market based economic rents. Full and fair market prices for logs would eliminate one of the major disincentives to private production forestry through plantations within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing the Australian government could do to speed up this process to phase out native forestry it would be to reward those states that stop the destruction and to penalise those states which do not. But, of course, one hears bleating from the rapacious loggers and woodchippers. They say that there would not be enough hardwood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal in some detail with the question of whether or not we could move quickly to a much greater reliance on softwoods. According to prominent spokespersons for the softwood industry, the answer is a resounding yes, we can rely on softwoods and we can reduce dramatically our reliance on hardwoods. The vast bulk, some 95 per cent, of all hardwood logged in Australian native forests is utilised in the housing and construction industry. Only a small percentage is used in appearance grade applications. Softwood radiata pine can and does effectively substitute for hardwood as a framing material in the housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Softwood resourced from government, semi-government and private plantations is on-stream. Between 1991 and the year 2000, the availability of softwood plantation sawlog in Australia will likely double from 3.6 million cubic metres to approximately seven million cubic metres. It should be noted that the volume increase in softwood is in the vicinity of the total hardwood log availability within the next five years and will exceed hardwood log availability as we move towards the 21st century. Therefore, the question logically arises as to whether we need to cut indigenous hardwood forests at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In pulp and paper production there is no easy substitution of softwood for hardwood as various grades and products require various proportions of softwood and hardwood chips. Currently, however, there is a worldwide surplus of hardwood chip. This could effectively be utilised to fill any shortfall of hardwood chip resource for pulp and paper production until Australia's own hardwood plantation resource comes more fully on-stream. This is recognised by at least one major pulp and paper producer, which is actively encouraging Victorian and South Australian farmers to provide suitable areas for hardwood plantation production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logical question, therefore, arises as to what degree the large-scale hardwood woodchip industry is an essential element of the industry. Over the next five years, hardwood log production should diminish substantially, thus also reducing the amount of woodchip available through milling, forest enhancement programs and thinnings. Even if logging were to continue in native forests, in due course hardwood plantations, which already total some 130,000 hectares, will replace any need to log our natural indigenous forests to obtain hardwood sawlogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first areas of hardwood plantation resources are now coming on stream in Western Australia and need to be expanded dramatically to allow accelerated reduction of logging of our native forests. Naturally, fine hardwood furnishings can come only from such timbers. However, many other areas can easily find a substitute. For example, high quality finger jointed pine mouldings can be a substitute for hardwood architraves. Some hardwood woodchip would still be produced in the milling of hardwood timbers for fine furniture, but this could be utilised domestically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real need at all levels of Australian government and semi-government instrumentalities to facilitate a coordinated investment program for both softwood and hardwood plantations. Without such a culture, the $2.6 billion import of timber and timber products will worsen. Import replacement, however, can succeed only where the product is produced cost effectively and profitably within Australia. Increased resources of both hardwood and softwood are needed to effectively substitute for imports and to explore the potential export market for the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I readily accept the fact that you cannot move forthwith to stop all logging in native forests without some pain. Whilst I regret that, work needs to be done to ensure that the pain is reduced by the maximum amount. We have seen situations in Queensland, for example, where a logging industry that existed in the wet tropics was phased out and people were moved to other jobs in the tourist industry and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is regrettable that this move will have an impact on employment in some parts of the country, it is a fact that plantations also need labour to plant, thin and harvest the timber. In those circumstances, I think that the quicker we move to bite the bullet the better it will be not only for the persons who are working in the timber industry at present but also for the nation economically and, most importantly, for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I am well aware of the fact that the logging industry is not going to die without a great fight. In Australia's national interest, we have to do something to change dramatically the present practices. If governments do not move to require the industry to move to plantations, then the industry will continue to use cheaply available native forests and that is not, as I have been pointing out, in anybody's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments against logging and chipping in native forests are, in my view, unassailable. In the national interest, we should stop such logging forthwith. As a nation, we should require the states to charge economic rentals for their forests forthwith. We should encourage plantations, both private and public, as a matter of national priority. We should move to substitute softwood stock for hardwood stock wherever possible. We should stop the desecration of our national forests and we should do it now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking today to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I would like to raise a few matters regarding the Department of Veterans' Affairs. No-one could be more supportive of the Australia Remembers commemorative events than I am. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) should be commended for his enthusiasm for the project. Recently, however, some situations in relation to the administration of care for veterans in the Riverina have been drawn to my attention and are a cause for concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was first approached by a number of health carers in the Leeton area who were concerned about a veteran whom we shall call `Bill C'. He had been brought to their attention and required home nursing care. Mr C enlisted at Wagga Wagga in July 1940 when he was 17. Bill embarked from Sydney on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queen Mary</EMPHASIS> on 2 February 1941 and landed on Singapore Island on 18 February 1941. He spent time in Malaya, was captured in February 1942 and was interned in the notorious Changi prison. Bill spent most of his internment in Japan at Osaka and Kawasaka subcamp, where he was forced to work in coal mines and shipbuilding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a prisoner, Bill was repeatedly bashed with rifle butts about the head and shoulders, which later in his life created symptoms of epilepsy. He had all his fingers and toes broken and was lined up in front of a firing squad and threatened with execution. He also had to eat rats in order to avoid starvation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entries in his diary state `everyone received a letter today except Bill', `food&mdash;main thought&mdash;forever hungry', `3 small bowls of rice a day in the Double Diamond mine', `they hit us with anything and we don't know who will be next', and `God's help and the old Aussie spirit won through'. Bill would have been shot if the Japanese had discovered this diary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill C was liberated in August 1945. In his diary he describes the day as `the best day of my life'. When he was liberated, Bill, a man who stood six feet two inches, weighed less than six stone. He was fed and cared for by the Americans before being sent home. Unfortunately, Bill's story is not unique, as many Australians suffered similar punishment at the hands of the Japanese and many did not return. On his return home, Bill was in very poor health. He suffered from depression, epilepsy, Singapore ear, tropical ulcers, dysentery, malaria, beri beri fever, migraines and tinea. Upon his return to Australia, Bill underwent shock treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually he went to live in Leeton with his mother and sister. Bill later married and had four children. His marriage failed due to ongoing problems that were a direct result of his war experiences. For many years, Bill and his sister Jean battled on with little help, and finally he was bedridden and could breathe only with the aid of oxygen. Bill paid for his oxygen for years, and only months before he died he purchased his own hospital bed which enabled him to remain in a sitting position to ease his laboured breathing. It was during only the last seven months of his life that Bill received any nursing help from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill's sister Jean looked after him 24 hours a day and spent many nights attending his needs with an oxygen nebuliser and trying to alleviate his anxiety. On 7 March I received a message in my office that Bill, then aged 72, was having respiratory problems along with a number of other debilitating complaints. The message was that Bill could not do anything for himself and that a private nursing agency was providing nurses twice a day. The report said that, because his sister who was caring for him was elderly, he should have been in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, prior to this Bill had been hospitalised on many occasions but when in hospital he became depressed and frightened&mdash;not because of a lack of care by the hospital staff but because of his traumatic wartime experiences. The report said the nursing hours being provided were certainly not excessive and that it would be well worth while having nurses make a check visit in the middle of the day as well as in the night. This would particularly be the case when Bill's carer was ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a number of inquiries I found that many requests had been made to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for extra nursing assistance for Bill, but the department had refused that additional care and suggested Home Care be approached. Anyone who lives in rural New South Wales knows that Home Care is stretched to the limit and in Bill's case he required the type of assistance that Home Care does not have a mandate to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the refusal of the department came after suggestions over a long period by health workers, doctors and nurses that extra nursing care was required. A decision was made against that advice but assessors from the Department of Veterans' Affairs had not even seen the veteran&mdash;certainly not in recent times. Unfortunately, before I could do anything to try to assist Mr C, he passed away on 7 March 1995. Because I was upset with this treatment of a veteran and did not wish the same thing to happen to others, I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 15 March 1995 asking him to inquire into Mr C's case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 May I received a reply from the minister that, contrary to my information, the department had made arrangements for the provision of in-home respite services and that Mr C had passed away before the arrangements could be implemented. The minister said that he regretted the department was not made aware of the situation earlier. In fact, when assistance was sought from the Department of Veterans' Affairs in December 1994, the carers were dismayed to receive the response, in refusing the request, `Yes, but you told us he was dying in September.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing about this matter is that the minister has been misinformed, as the Department of Veterans' Affairs was made aware of Bill's situation at least three months before he passed away. It appears that one of the reasons for this inhumane debacle is a confrontation between sections of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and private nursing services that provide most of the nursing care for veterans in their homes in rural New South Wales&mdash;and no doubt this occurs in other parts of Australia. If these services, which arguably provide a more economical service than can be provided by government agencies, are not supported and encouraged, then I fear for the future welfare of veterans who have no alternative than to remain at home. For some who wish to remain in their homes to die, this should be their prerogative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the feud between sections of the department and private nursing services is so intense that the department has had at least one nursing service under investigation for some time, with no fault yet having been found, except that it wants to get on with the job of caring for the sick and ailing veterans. In case people think I have a vested interest in the nursing services, if the government does not wish to have these services, it must quickly find another way of providing care for our ailing veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this, I believe there is a move by sections of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to transfer its home nursing responsibilities to the Home Care organisation that is not geared to provide the nursing care that veterans require, even if it had the resources to spend time with the veterans. As every member knows, the Home Care organisation, as I said before, is stretched to the limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Prime Minister Ben Chifley in 1946 told this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon this national parliament rests the responsibility that the right thing shall be done by those who serve their country at the time of war.</PARA>
<PARA>If there is any possibility that this is not occurring, whether it be bureaucratic bungling or trying to save money or whatever, it is just not on. We owe these people too much for any procrastination when it comes to their care. If ever there is any doubt as to the validity of the veteran's case for assistance, the judgment must come down in favour of the veteran&mdash;this means any Australian veteran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But how much more should this apply to those unfortunate souls who were prisoners of the Japanese. To think that a bureaucrat or anyone else could hold up their aid is unthinkable. If there is a problem, it must be fixed and fixed quickly. If we feel we cannot afford this assistance to veterans, we may have to rethink the $8 million being spent on the Australia Remembers commemorations. I am a great supporter of those commemorations, but I think aid to the veterans must come first. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. The opposition is policy free. But, of course, far in excess of all the forecasts and predictions, the government actually brought down a $700 million surplus&mdash;and the opposition still cannot give the government any credit for that&mdash;while maintaining its strong commitment to job creation and programs for the unemployed. That is one important factor I would like to focus on today. I was very pleased to see the government continue its strong support for the unemployed and, of course, maintain the initiatives in Working Nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not hear anything positive from the members of the opposition. All we hear from them is some vague idea of a charter of honesty. All the Australian people really want to hear from them is some policies. It would be nice if they were honest and gave us a few of their policies rather than keep the Australian electorate in the dark. That is all the electorate really wants to hear but all we get is this charter of honesty. That is a new one for Honest John, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one fell swoop, the government has brought down a responsible budget that has been endorsed by the financial markets, business to a large extent, the public sector and, most importantly, average Australians. In the last few weeks, I have received a very positive response from the people in my electorate. The most important thing is that ordinary Australians&mdash;whether they be workers, unemployed, pensioners, sole parents or in a family&mdash;will be the big winners out of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will no doubt hear a lot from the opposition over the next few months, and most of it will probably be in the same vein as what we have heard from it so far. There really is no pleasing some people. In a period of strong economic growth the government has brought down a responsible surplus that has won over the markets, and still the opposition is not satisfied. I have said it before in this place and I will say it again: Australia is in one of the most prolonged periods of strong growth in our history, and we have low inflation too. These are very important elements in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to use the opportunity presented by this debate today to highlight some of the positives in the budget and to point out a few truths about the shallow tactics employed by the opposition lately. The opposition has continually obstructed the government at every turn and has criticised it for allegedly not governing properly. Now we have brought down a responsible budget and that is still not good enough for those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of this budget is to boost national savings and jobs&mdash;jobs for the long-term unemployed, for disadvantaged people and for youth. In short, it is to boost jobs for people who have been most severely affected. Through the twin strategies of the Working Nation document and the budget, the government will effect real reform in the areas of labour market assistance and job creation. At the same time, it will pursue responsible economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years, the government has reformed the way the economy works by turning it into a more efficient and competitive economy enabling Australia to make its way in the world. That has been a very important aspect of this budget. It has also been a very important aspect over the last 12 years for the Labor government. Now we are faced with a period of stable growth and low inflation&mdash;the goal of Australian governments for the last 30 years. We face a bright future of prosperity in this nation. However, the task before the government now is to ensure that the recovery will benefit everyone, including the most disadvantaged job seekers in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget seeks to consolidate and improve our economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that progress. This budget is unique as it represents a new benchmark in budget reporting and government accountability. But, most of all, this budget is unique because it operates in conjunction with the Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. This scheme is without doubt one of the most ambitious, comprehensive and well thought out plans to reduce unemployment that this nation has ever seen. It is certainly having a very strong effect in my own electorate. I congratulate all those people who are actively supporting and taking advantage of the initiatives in the Working Nation statement. The strategies outlined in Working Nation will help the unemployed take their place in contemporary Australian society with dignity and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of Oxley has areas of significantly high unemployment but it also has a number of competent and vigorous development groups and community organisations that enjoy good relations with local industry. I have devoted a great deal of my time to finding ways of promoting employment growth in my electorate as well as nationally, as is the case with my colleagues on this side of the House. That is the positive sort of thing that members of this place need to be doing to ensure that Australians who are not as well off as we are do benefit from initiatives like Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May last year, I established a local employment advisory group to assist in ways which could help the government's employment task force to reflect the priorities of my own electorate. That task force was jointly chaired by my colleagues the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who were involved in a caucus committee in the parliament as well. The members of my local advisory group met with local employers, training providers, officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and members of the trade union movement, to gauge the effectiveness of current government employment policies in my local region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's No. 1 priority remains assisting those unemployed back into the work force. That is working at the moment. Along with my colleagues on this side of the House, I have a very strong commitment to that initiative. My electorate, with its well established training network, including the Regional Development Corporation, three skillshare programs, group training schemes and private trainers, is well placed to pick up on the initiatives outlined in the budget and to pick up on the continuing initiatives outlined in the Working Nation statement. I will certainly be encouraging them to pick up on the initiatives in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on all Australians to look at the positive things in this budget rather than listen to the opposition's negative point of view. When we look at the budget we ought to look at the whole budget, the whole picture, and see what it really means for all Australians. The problem is that those opposite look at its bits and pieces and hone in on the negatives instead of looking at the big picture, which is absolutely important. We must look at the big picture to ensure that we benefit from all the initiatives that will come forward from this budget. Opposition members know that, but they will not admit it. It is not unusual for those opposite to be floundering around wondering what they are going to do next. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) mentioned, the opposition is policy free and has no direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to say that the period of jobless growth that marked the first year and three-quarters of the recovery is now behind us. More than 230,000 extra jobs have been created since April last year and the unemployment rate has fallen from 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent, and it will go lower with the plans outlined in the budget and Working Nation. Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.5 per cent and another quarter of a million jobs are expected to be created. That is good news for the unemployed. That will result in an unemployment rate by the middle of next year that is well below the double digit figures I mentioned before. Some of the unemployment figures that have come out recently show that downward trend, which is a very positive step for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the latest business investment figures did not show the immediate increase, but the government's forecast of 4.5 per cent growth is not overly optimistic, contrary to what was stated by the opposition last week. With the added incentive of the favourable tax regimes for business over coming years, the benefits of increased profit margins and productivity will show up in higher investment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among these added incentives, the budget includes the provision of the accelerated depreciation allowance, the development allowance for large projects, the general investment allowance, a 150 per cent write-off for research and development expenditure and the reduction of company tax to an internationally competitive rate of 33 per cent. All these incentives will reduce the government's tax revenue by nearly $3 billion for 1994-95, resulting in a substantial benefit for business. This further reduction in the tax rate will allow business to expand and take on more workers, as will the generous incentives offered under the employment and training initiatives in Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While labour market programs play an important role in assisting the unemployed to get back to work, it will only be through private sector investment that sustained employment growth of the level required to substantially reduce the unemployment rate will actually occur. The increase in the company tax rate to 36 per cent has been the cause of some comment, but the important thing to note is that the government took this step at a time of high growth and profitability and it will provide further incentives for business to invest and will provide further job opportunities. With inflation at its lowest level for 30 years and interest rates at their lowest level for 20 years, these measures will be of great assistance to business. I encourage business to take full advantage of them and to give the people who desperately need jobs a chance of employment. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will hear more from me. I could talk all day about this budget. I am just starting to warm up and the Speaker has arrived so I know he will be interested in some of things I am going to say because his electorate will benefit from a lot of the government's initiatives as will people in the electorate of the member for Ryan (Mr Moore). The member for Ryan does not seem to realise that his electorate will benefit like any of our electorates will from this budget. I hope he writes a letter, like the ones he writes to my constituents, to his constituents and tells them what a good budget this is and what great initiatives it contains. We are in neighbouring electorates so we manage to share things from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I said before, the most important of the government's aims is to reduce unemployment, and that is an important thing for us all. Members need not be reminded of the urgency with which we must address this issue. It is something that has always received priority from members on this side of the House. I am pleased and proud to say that Working Nation has confirmed our faith and the determination of this government to devote all its efforts to getting Australians back to work. As a nation, we have to provide real hope to the unemployed, and Working Nation does that. In reforming the labour market assistance programs it will focus on an area where problems have been perceived in the past and will make the delivery of labour market assistance much more effective and more relevant. Indeed, the reforms of labour market assistance in Working Nation could justifiably be called a revolution in training methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing in this budget is that funding for Working Nation has not been reduced. This funding will continue to support an innovative project in my electorate called a transition centre. For the benefit of honourable members who may be unfamiliar with the concept of a transition centre, I will enlighten them a little. It was a successful pilot in my electorate. The aim of a transition centre is to provide long-term employment by creating new industries in its own area. The aims of the concept are to identify potentially commercially viable products for process developments as import replacements; identify firms willing to produce and market proven products; undertake product and process development work using teams of long-term unemployed; and, finally, to transfer proven, successful products to industry, providing full-time employment for the former long-term unemployed. So I certainly welcome the visit of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and his announcement of those initiatives last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this emphasis on long-term planning and creating new opportunities that distinguishes the transition centre from former labour market programs which, despite the undoubted best intentions and efforts of those running them, often focused on short-term employment goals. Unlike these schemes, the transition centre aims to create sustainable employment for the long-term unemployed in the Ipswich region by establishing industries that will focus on import replacement. Following the successful completion of the pilot project, it is estimated that a fully operational centre will assist up to 200 long-term unemployed people every year. That is a great credit to the people who have been running that for some time now. I have seen cases myself where long-term unemployed people, not only from my own electorate but also from other electorates, have benefited through this program, and people who thought they were going to be unemployed forever have been able to come through with jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exciting aspect of this project is how it will integrate the entire local community. That is very important. With private sector support and patronage, local employment opportunities and markets can be identified and explored as potential income generating options for the region. The centre will provide a facility to develop and manufacture goods and provide training and work experience for the long-term unemployed. The goods and services produced at the centre will be aimed at replacing imports, rather than competing with Australian producers. In fact, there are export opportunities there that people have taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this project cannot be overstated. It has huge potential and will hopefully represent a change in Ipswich's place in the national scheme of things. The region will be well placed to be at the leading edge of the employment and training initiatives outlined in the white paper. If this project proves to be successful, as I am sure it will, the concept will be transferred to other areas around Australia. You will be able to say that you heard it from Ipswich first because a lot of good things have come out of Ipswich, as you well know, Mr Speaker, when you see what happens on the football field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Radically transforming the way employment measures are implemented will be a very important focus from this transition centre. Import replacement on a sustainable basis will create much needed new jobs because many products formerly manufactured in Australia have been replaced by imports with the strongest period of this trend being the 1970s and 1980s. We now have some good news in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the transition centre funding, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training also announced that the project will receive an additional $164,000 under the jobskills program to provide training and work experience support to help the long-term unemployed make the transition into the work force. I would like to continue in this vain, concentrating on the employment and training initiatives in Working Nation, which will be funded by the 1994-95 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the initiatives in the budget and in the Working Nation statement that covers employment are very important aspects of this budget and the continuation of the Working Nation statement. I believe that many of these initiatives are things that we, as members of parliament, should pick up and focus on in our own electorates to ensure that the benefits from the government's initiatives on employment really reach the heart of the needs of Australians out there in the workplace, particularly addressing the needs of our long-term unemployed. I think we have a tremendous record in that respect. I realise that time is going to beat me, so I will pause there. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his very perceptive comments on the reception of the Justice Statement around Australia. The statement has three major themes running through it, as the honourable member may be aware. The first is that prevention is better than cure&mdash;we should direct our energies towards ensuring that problems do not become legal problems and that people do not need to have recourse to formal legal processes. The second is that there needs to be a range of structural changes in a number of the major components of the legal system&mdash;namely, the legal profession itself and some of the major components of that system, such as the way in which legal aid commissions operate in this country. The third deals with access to particular programs and the expansion of a range of programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All three of those themes have an immediate and important impact on the way in which Australian families have recourse to legal services in this country, particularly in terms of the focus on making sure support services are in place so that families do not need to have recourse to formal legal processes. To this end, given that the Commonwealth's major jurisdiction obviously is in the area of family law, the statement unashamedly addresses that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major additions to the $22 million a year which is provided to the 90-odd community based family support organisations in this country. These organisations currently assist something like 160,000 people annually and they will be able to expand those services considerably. Around $12.3 million will be spent over the four years on new services. This will mean a doubling of premarriage education services, and that something like 45,000 Australians will have the benefit of that education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of new funding initiatives will help services attune their programs to the needs of Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds. There will be a massive increase in family skill training. There will also be a major increase in adolescent and mediation therapy centres, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, obviously some relationships and marriages will fail. To that extent, the government has greatly supported the use of mediation in Family Court proceedings where that service is available. Particularly where there are no examples of domestic violence, services such as mediation have proven to be very effective. Something like $10 million over four years has been allocated to the expansion of both the court and the community sectors and to an increased counselling provision within the Family Court. That will see the Family Court being able to establish new counselling registries in Coffs Harbour, Mackay and Geelong. It will be able to upgrade&mdash;I know this is of interest to the member for Leichhardt&mdash;the existing registry in Cairns to a full counselling registry. In addition, there is now the development throughout Australia of pilot programs for handover and visiting centres to deal with those access matters where there is a difficulty between the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all these services will greatly expand the range of programs available to Australian families. Importantly, they will help families stay together in the first instance. On those occasions where there are breakdowns of relationships, breakdowns of marriage, the services will be in place to make sure that that experience is as less traumatic as possible.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that your recent budget, which was supposed to be an election manifesto but which was in fact just a four-day flop, has been condemned by industry groups as a further attack on jobs?

The difference between us and the United States is that we have increased employment without bringing about the devastating side effects which were referred to yesterday by the Prime Minister in reading from a speech given at the OECD by the US Secretary of Labour, Mr Reich.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course we have, through the enterprise bargaining process, put in safeguards to ensure that workers cannot be exploited and there is no net disadvantage to them. All of these sorts of factors indicate that Australia has been very concerned not only to create jobs at a record rate but also to ensure that it is done on a basis which is equitable; that the people get jobs which pay decent wages and that there is no exploitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that stands in marked contrast, I might say, to what the opposition would have. The opposition's policy, as articulated by the previous spokesman on industrial relations, now Leader of the Opposition, was to hack away at those safety nets, to ensure that there would be a minimum array of safeguards. In that respect, the opposition wants to go down the American path, to go towards that kind of a labour market where there is exploitation, where you do have lots of working poor. Of course, in doing that the opposition would greatly exacerbate wage differentials and the inequality of the distribution of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nation has everything to be proud about in terms of its employment performance over the last few years. It has created jobs at a very rapid rate&mdash;a rate that is as fast as that of any other country in the Western world&mdash;and it has done so on a basis of equity for the people in the work force. The government's Working Nation program, which we adopted last year, is out there as an example to the rest of the world of what you can do to assist the disadvantaged in the labour market. The fall of over 100,000 in the number of long-term unemployed bears testimony to the importance of that Working Nation package&mdash;which, of course, is enhanced in this year's budget with the amount to be spent under Working Nation greater in 1995-96 than in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the OECD&mdash;and I will conclude on this point&mdash;one of the great concerns that was expressed not only by Mr Reich but also on the part of many people speaking for European countries, and by the Secretary-General of the OECD speaking on behalf of that organisation, was the great concern about `exclusion'&mdash;that is, the concern that larger and larger numbers of people in Western societies are not sharing in the increased prosperity, so that, as productivity improves and GDP increases per head, there is a growing number of persons who are excluded from benefiting from that, either through unemployment or through exploitation in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not experiencing either of those. Certainly we have unemployment, and that unemployment is being brought down rapidly, thank goodness. That, of course, is something which we are doing faster than just about any other country in the Western world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that there has been, on the face of it, a large increase in the retail trade figures for April; that is, an increase of 4.6 per cent&mdash;not 4.1 per cent, as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition earlier. That 4.6 per cent increase, of course, is well above market expectations. But I think it is important to take note of what the statistician had to say in his release. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Users should note that this could, in part, be due to greater retail activity across Australia surrounding Easter and Anzac Day. The ABS requires more information to determine if this increased activity represents a shift in regular trading patterns which would affect seasonal adjustment factors . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that this large increase may be explained by this problem with the seasonal adjustment factor.If I might just explain that a little further, there are two factors basically at work. Firstly, the timing of Easter changes from year to year, and the seasonal adjustment factors only react with a lag. In 1994 Easter was very early in April, and most of the effect on retail sales fell in March; whereas this year Easter was in the middle of April, and the effect on retail sales would be recorded in April. It is likely that the seasonal adjustment factors have not adequately compensated for this change in the timing of Easter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is an increasing trend for extended retail trading hours, including public holidays. At present, the seasonal adjustment factors include an allowance for the number of trading days in the month. To the extent that retailers trade on public holidays and that may not adequately be reflected in the adjustment for the number of trading days, then the seasonally adjusted estimate for retail sales is likely to overstate the underlying situation. That appears to be the case in April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the statistician notes, further information on these developments needs to be obtained before any conclusive judgment can be made about the adequacy of the current seasonal adjustment factors. In the meantime, it would seem more sensible to have regard to the trend figures for retail sales. What they show is an increase of 0.5 per cent in April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances of doubt about the seasonal adjustment factors being adequately taken into account, it would seem more appropriate to have regard to the trend number. That would also be more consistent with the general understanding most people have about the economy, which is that the degree of activity is slowing but still continuing at a reasonable pace and certainly not zooming away, as the April seasonally adjusted figures would lead one to believe if one took them at face value.</PARA>

Just about everybody is in that position. I cannot think of anyone who is not, because the yen is so strong. The opposition wants to thrash around in a state of great agitation about the fact that we are devaluing against the yen. If is a case for such agitation, ministers for finance all around the world would be cutting their throats because they are all in the same position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country is doing better than just about any other country in terms of maintaining strong, low-inflation growth. That outcome is one which the Australian people should appreciate as being one which is serving them tremendously well. They are living in a country which has growth continuing at a rate which is at the top level of rates of growth amongst Western developed countries, with strong growth of employment, falling unemployment and inflation levels which, after four years of strong growth, are still around the three per cent mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of outcome was just inconceivable when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country. When he was there, we had double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. It was an amazing achievement, actually, to be able to have double digit unemployment and double digit inflation both at once. It was under him also that we first had the current account deficit go over the 5 1/2 per cent of GDP mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition clearly has nothing to point out to this government in terms of telling us how to manage the economy. The economy of this country is being run in a way which is the envy of most other countries around the western world. The current account issue is one which is being addressed as fulsomely as possible through the budget and through the proposal in relation to superannuation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this budget directly takes on the current account issue and says that we are going to improve national savings by reducing public sector dissavings through an immediate move to budget surplus and higher budget surpluses in the years thereafter, meaning a significant boost to savings in this year 1995-96 and years to come. Also, there will be a move to increased private savings by way of superannuation initiatives, which are dramatic and extraordinary in terms of their scope. They will eventually boost private savings in this country by some four per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, along with the budget proposals, is about as comprehensive a way as one could possibly imagine for a government to tackle a current account problem. It is saying that what this country needs to do is boost its own savings performance, and to do that considerably and in a way which means we will be relying less on the savings of foreigners and therefore there will be less reliance on capital inflow and less current account problem in the future. That is an appropriate response. It is a very comprehensive, detailed response to the only issue of concern about the Australian economy at the moment.

In the context of these renewed efforts by the tobacco companies, we need to re-examine our legislative bans, strong as they are, and to tighten them further in cooperation with the states. I would certainly want to see bans on advertising where young people purchase tobacco and at sporting events. We need a genuine national commitment, and I hope to persuade my state and territory colleagues to implement complementary legislation where necessary and particularly to enforce legislation prohibiting sales to minors, which they have not done to any extent. We retain our commitment to reducing smoking in the community and I am sure that is shared by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I am aware of calls by the opposition to freeze the superannuation guarantee at existing levels in the unlikely event that it wins the next election. That was said, of course, at the last election to be the opposition's policy. It was reaffirmed by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply&mdash;or should I say rant&mdash;to this House last sitting week. What he said then was that on a change of government `any existing retirement benefits will be preserved'; that is, they will be frozen at the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it does not mean that, perhaps you had better explain what it does mean. If one reads the words `any existing retirement benefits will be preserved', one would assume that it means&mdash;in the event of no further explanation from the opposition&mdash;that it is a rerun of the coalition's promise at the last election, to freeze the SGC at the level at which it found it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would mean that, at the next election, the requirement under the SG would be six per cent for larger employers and five per cent for smaller employers. To freeze superannuation contributions at this level would seriously detract from the improvements in retirement benefits that Australian workers stand to gain from the superannuation guarantee employer contributions and, of course, from the policy initiatives that I announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving for our future</EMPHASIS>; that is, a member contribution and a matching government contribution. A couple in their mid-30s will receive a retirement benefit 75 per cent higher than the age pension as a result of the initiatives announced on budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the coalition were to freeze the super guarantee contribution, employees on average weekly earnings, instead of having the super guarantee and the benefits that we announced on budget night, would lose about 62 per cent of their potential superannuation benefits if they work for large employers, and about 69 per cent of their final benefits if they work for small employers. To freeze the SGC at the 1996 levels would also permanently discriminate against the employees of small employers, who would receive superannuation benefits up to 17 per cent smaller than the employees of large employers. The estimated effect on total savings would be very significant. By the year 2000, about $17 billion of national savings measured in today's dollars would be lost. By the year 2003, that would be about $45 billion, and it would be running at an annual loss of about $11 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's proposals would also have a significant impact on employees. If one looks at the impact on employees into the next century as set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Savings for our future</EMPHASIS>, under our policy people on average weekly earnings would receive a retirement benefit of $461,900. But with the benefit from the SGC frozen at its 1996 levels and with nothing else in addition through employee contributions and the matching government contribution, that amount would be only $143,000. In other words, they would be $318,500 worse off if they were employed by a small employer, or $288,000 worse off if they were employed by a large employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The impact of what the Leader of the Opposition said on budget night is enormous. His glib promise, `I will preserve benefits at that point'&mdash;that is, `I will freeze them'&mdash;means he is saying to the Australian people that he would dramatically reduce the retirement benefits that they could expect to get from the policies that this government has introduced and announced; that he would markedly reduce national savings to the tune of many billions of dollars per annum; and that he would markedly reduce the retirement incomes of the Australian people in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opposition member said, `Wait and see what we have to say.' We will wait and see with interest what else the opposition has to say apart from the freezing proposal. It has a spokesman for superannuation and retirement incomes, the member for Bradfield, who is working diligently away on trying to produce a policy. He has been doing it for the last two years. He has been so successful that he has now been dumped by his own electorate but is being retained to finish the policy. I cannot imagine that that policy, given the amount of time he has already had to develop it, is going to provide any great enhancement to either national savings or the retirement incomes of Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the evidence clearly shows&mdash;and I hope members in this House are aware, particularly the male members&mdash;that men not only die younger than women but also suffer significantly higher rates of injury and illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancers. Most worryingly of all, working men aged between 25 and 64 have a death rate twice as high as women of the same age. I regard that as totally unacceptable, and I am sure members of the community do too. Young men, for example, are three times more likely to die from car accidents and four times more likely to commit suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference will draw together representatives from a very wide range of fields including medicine, nursing, sociology, community health and consumer groups. The issues to be discussed are very broad, since this is the first conference, and will include mental health, suicide, violence, sexual health and occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important issues that is going to be debated is one that caused some mirth when I raised it in here last time, but it is taken seriously everywhere else&mdash;that is, the apparent conflict between masculinity and the willingness to seek medical help. The question that is being asked is: why do men think they are wimps if they go to a doctor to take care of their health? It is a very important question because they do not seek diagnosis early enough. It will be the subject of key speakers including Mr Trefor Lloyd, a men's health consultant from London.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another very important topic which will be raised, and I know it is of interest to some members opposite because I have had correspondence from them, and that is the latest developments in the area of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. I am very pleased to inform the House, and I see some members are interested, that Dr John Wasson from the United States Dartmouth Medical School will be speaking on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Men's ill health and early mortality are issues that affect us all. It is not a question of men's health versus women's health; it is men's health and women's health. We all have to recognise the very special problems associated with being a man in our society and address them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one is to tighten Commonwealth outlays as happened in this budget then obviously steps have to be taken to do that. The major reduction was through changes to the indexation arrangements for various programs. This was done in relation to the wages side by changing from the previous arrangement to the safety net increase as a proportion of average weekly earnings and, in relation to the price side, by moving from the consumer price index to the underlying inflation rate. The change in the wages component was due to the fact that wage rises are increasingly determined on the basis of increased productivity. The safety net adjustment was taken as a proxy for the non-productivity based wage increase.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we just took the full average weekly earnings and then there were productivity improvements then one would be overcompensating for cost increases actually incurred. I believe the approach taken is highly defendable and appropriate. It applies across a vast number of programs, including, I assume, the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It will be expected, along with everyone else, to live with that indexation arrangement&mdash;an arrangement which implies that there will be some productivity improvements for any wage increase that may be paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is an appropriate course for the government to follow. Generally, wages policy is being pursued on the basis that it should be based, at least in part, on productivity improvement. There is absolutely no reason to exempt government employment from that. In respect of government programs, we expect that there will be a productive improvement and that that productivity improvement means that wage adjustments, in terms of the formula for the maintenance of the same real level of service, can be varied to take into account that productivity improvement. The wages factor can therefore be reduced to something like the safety net adjustment as a proxy for a non-productivity based wage increase. That is the general basis upon which we have made the changes to indexation. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is one of the many programs affected by that. It, along with others, will have to live with that new form of indexation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware of claims by some state governments that they are required by the national competition policy to privatise basic community services? Does the policy require state governments to privatise water, rail and ports?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="576" SPEAKER="Gear The Hon G." NAMEID="QG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CANNING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question. Yes, I am aware that some state governments are privatising and contracting out services in areas like water, rail and the waterfront and claiming this is necessary to comply with the national competition policy package. This is particularly so in Western Australia. Let me say that in every case they are wrong. There is nothing in the agreement which forces privatisation or contracting out. In fact the Western Australian government is acting on ideology alone and it appears to me that it hates the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government has made a decision to contract out the work currently being performed by water authority workers, but it has stopped this experienced work force from competing for the contracts. What the government has done effectively is taken the experts out of the market. The government is clearly restricting competition and this is not consistent with the competition policy agreement that Richard Court signed last month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked to employees in these industries and they are happy to face competition. They recognise the benefits of it, but they are bitterly disappointed that after a decade of efficiency improvements they are now being prevented from tendering for contracts in their own industry. Why? Because the Western Australian government claims it is necessary to take these people out of the industry because they do not pay the same taxes as the private sector and they cannot go broke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only wonder whether the Western Australian government read the agreement before it signed it at COAG last month, because the competitive neutrality principles are designed to ensure that competition between the public and the private sectors is fair and takes into account tax treatments, different access to debt and all the other relevant factors. But the water authority workers are not allowed to tender. They are not even allowed to compete. The Western Australian government's ideology apparently has no place for the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government has also failed to outline any plan for prices oversight. This was the key element of the competition policy reforms, and I understand it takes time to set up one of these pricing bodies if that is the way the Western Australian government is going to go. In the meantime, I am going to offer Mr Court the facilities of the Prices Surveillance Authority. In fact, I will write to him tonight, and we will have the PSA run its ruler over the changes that are being made by the Western Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the Western Australian government has similar plans for Westrail employees&mdash;privatising its work and preventing Westrail employees from tendering for the work, once again restricting competition. The Western Australian government has embarked on a similar approach at the Fremantle port. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, it was a decision based on ideology, designed with a political objective of challenging the union movement in that state. In fact the Western Australian minister said so. Mr Charlton talked about the fact that he recognised that his decision, in the words of a newspaper report, `could lead to industrial chaos' but decided to let it go ahead. That is the Western Australian government's view about waterfront reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing I can say in conclusion is that the Western Australian government and, clearly, the federal opposition have not been able to take a sensible and consistent approach on these issues because without policies they can only rely on ideology and the irrational hatred of the public sector. We have all heard about the pub with no beer. Here we have the political equivalent&mdash;the political party without any policies.</PARA>

It is an untruth based on the fiction that it has successfully micro-economically reformed the Australian waterfront and delivered substantial benefits to the Australian economy and, hence, to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those of us who have been on this side of the House for some years now have had the opportunity to sit here and watch what this government is really good at; that is, getting away with some enormous untruths. They are things that most people in the rest of the community would call downright deceit, but here we have to call them untruths. The performance of this government in reforming the waterfront is one of those classic areas of deceit&mdash;a series of untruths have been used to describe the waterfront reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have again seen the government hard at trying to deliver more untruths about waterfront reform. Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) typified in this House one of the great untruths about waterfront reform. This morning on the Elizabeth Jackson program on the local ABC radio station the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was hard at work at delivering more untruths about the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three great untruths that these people like to repeat over and over again. I would like to take members of this House through those three untruths that have been reported by ministers and prime ministers over time. They highlight the way in which this government has deceived the Australian public in relation to micro-economic reform of the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first untruth was made by the Minister for Transport on ABC radio this morning. He said that turnaround times for ships in Australian ports had improved significantly as a result of the government's waterfront reform program. The second great untruth was also engaged in by the minister this morning. He said that productivity levels on the Australian waterfront had increased significantly. The third great untruth, which was practised by the Prime Minister during question time in answer to a question put to him by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) yesterday, is that Australian ports are now as efficient as major European ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the three basic untruths that the government likes to repeat frequently when it talks about the Australian waterfront. Let me take those untruths one by one. Let us start with shipping turnaround times. A shipping turnaround time is how long it takes a ship to arrive in port, unload its cargo, load some more cargo and turn around and go out. Today the Minister for Transport said that our turnaround times have improved dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When waterfront reform commenced in 1989, the average turnaround time for ships visiting Australian ports was 44 hours. The average turnaround time today for a ship entering an Australian port is 53 hours. Pre the great micro-economic reform engaged in by this government, the turnaround time used to be 44 hours. But, post micro-economic reform of the waterfront, the turnaround time is 53 hours. That is an example of the success the government has had. We do not want any more of its success stories, please. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to elaborate on that point. Let me refer to a document produced by Liner Shipping Services. It produced this document earlier this year. Liner Shipping Services is a cooperative, if you like, of a number of shipping companies that operate in and out of Australia. This document highlights the percentage increase in average turnaround times for ships in Australian ports. It compares the end of 1994 with the end of 1993. It goes through the major ports. In Brisbane, turnaround times have increased by 22 per cent; in Sydney, which is one of the major ports of Australia, they have increased by 46 per cent; in Melbourne, they have increased by 43 per cent; and, in Adelaide, they have increased by 55 per cent. It is a great untruth for the government to say that our waterfront reform process has dramatically changed turnaround times for Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great untruth that these people love to engage in is that our ports are now considerably more efficient. On ABC radio today, the Minister for Transport said that we have seen a huge increase in efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me use the figures provided by Conaust, which is the largest stevedoring firm in Australia today, to prove that to be a giant untruth. For example, the current container loading rate for Conaust is 14 containers per hour. What was the container loading rate for Conaust prior to waterfront reform in 1989? It was 14.1 containers per hour. Does that equate to a giant increase in efficiency on the Australian waterfront under this government's management? I would say most Australians would say that no, it does not. Yet again, the government has been engaging in giant untruths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, going to the figures provided by Liner Shipping Services and comparing container loading rates from the end of 1993 to the end of 1994, and going through them by port, they show that container loading rates handled in Brisbane ports have decreased by 25 per cent; in Sydney they have decreased by 26 per cent; in Melbourne they have decreased by 18 per cent; and in Adelaide they have decreased by 15 per cent. So this is yet another example of a giant untruth practised by this government, and again this morning by the minister on ABC radio, about the efficiency levels on our Australian waterfront post reform by this government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the other untruth that was peddled by the Prime Minister yesterday in his answer in question time. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have the same turnaround times as they have in the major European ports.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at Contship Container Lines Limited, which is a very large operator. It travels to 44 ports around the world almost on a daily basis. It has provided a comparative analysis of the performance of Australian ports versus other ports around the world. It uses as a typical European port the port of Antwerp. Let us look at the performance of Antwerp in turnaround times&mdash;the performance that the Prime Minister identified. At the end of 1994, the average ship going into the port of Antwerp took 31.98 hours&mdash;32 hours&mdash;to turn around. What was the average figure in, say, the port of Sydney? It was 59.6 hours&mdash;virtually doubled. What was the average figure in Melbourne? It was 53 hours&mdash;almost doubled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proves that the Prime Minister said something yesterday that was an untruth. But, if you want to make it look even worse, do not look at the major European ports, look at one of our nearest neighbours, New Zealand. Let us compare the turnaround times in New Zealand ports versus those ports of Sydney and Melbourne. In New Zealand in the port of Auckland, turnaround times at the end of 1994 averaged 24.38 hours versus 60 hours in Sydney and 53 hours in Melbourne. So it is a giant untruth to say that we are comparable in turnaround times with other countries around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear, by any objective measurement, that what the government has been doing about waterfront performance is both a disaster and an expensive flop. Why is it an expensive flop? We spent $430 million undertaking this waterfront reform program&mdash;that is, the taxpayers of Australia and importers and exporters have spent $430 million paying for waterfront reform. We obviously have not benefited from it because we have not got improved waterfront performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who did benefit from it? No prizes for guessing: your mates in the trade union movement, the wharfies themselves. Those 4,000-odd who took a redundancy package picked up an extra $100,000 on average for their redundancy. Weren't they great people to sacrifice their jobs for all this money on top of their super, long service, sick leave, and so forth. In fact, many of them have not sacrificed their jobs. They are back at the wharf today working on the B register, which is casual employment. They have their redundancy and their superannuation, and they are back with a job on the waterfront at this moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But do not just think that the fellows who retired prematurely got the best part of the deal. The best part of the deal goes to the wharfies who stayed there. Let me just give you an idea of how they have benefited. According to Conaust's own figures which were presented in a speech given at a conference I attended in March of this year in Sydney, a grade 4 wharfie&mdash;that is, the average wharfie working on the Australian waterfront&mdash;before the completion of the waterfront reform process in 1992, earned on average $34,000. Following the reform process, his wage increased to $45,000. By 1993, his wage was $65,000. By the end of last year, on average, the wage of the average wharfie was $75,000&mdash;more than a doubling of the wharfie's wage over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the average wage for the average Aussie? It is around $30,000. But that is not good enough for us on the waterfront. In addition to their wage, they get free clothing and footwear, five weeks annual leave, a 35-hour week, 27 1/2 per cent holiday leave loading, a very generous superannuation scheme and a 45-minute recreation break during every seven-hour working day. Just to make sure they can usefully occupy the 45 minutes paid recreation break during the day, most major ports have gyms, saunas, tennis courts and so forth for the wharfies to work out the stresses and strains of the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the benefits of waterfront reform have gone. That is why you see today in Western Australia the Maritime Union of Australia trying to stop somebody breaking up the party. It is a wonderful party. There you have the government forking out $430 million. There you have the wages going up by more than double. There you have conditions most people would drool over and somebody comes along and wants to break up the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party pooper is called Stateships and BAAC in Western Australia. BAAC wants to employ people who are not members of the union. They have offered to provide a stevedoring service to Stateships, a state-owned government business enterprise in Western Australia, 20 per cent cheaper than has been provided before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That BAAC can even get off the ground and provide a stevedoring service is proof and evidence of the fact that waterfront reform in Australia has failed. If it had succeeded, BAAC would not have a hope in hell of being able to be in there, competitively tendering against a major, well established business with all the equipment, expertise and customer base to assist it in maintaining its business. BAAC is in there today because waterfront reform in this country has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Prime Minister tried to say that what you see in Western Australia at the moment with BAAC and the state government of Western Australia is coalition policy hard at work, trying to crush the ordinary working man. What utter nonsense! What you see in Western Australia today, apart from living evidence that this government's waterfront reform program has failed, is a government interested in doing the best things by its own people in Western Australia by getting a state owned business the cheapest possible stevedoring services that are available to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What government would not, when offered a discount of 20 per cent on its stevedoring services, pick up those services and run with them? Yet there is a government that would not. It is called the federal Commonwealth government&mdash;the Labor Party. It is a case of Labor Party people protecting a Labor Party rort. That Labor Party rort, supported yesterday in question time by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Transport over the last week or two, has cost this country $430 million to date. It is costing this country the loss of competitiveness on our Australian waterfront and, ultimately, it is costing Australian men and women lots and lots of jobs. That is why we need a change: these people protect the rorts of people who have been selfish and greedy and have cost Australians a hell of a lot of jobs over a lot of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the interruption, I was saying that this government has a proud record of micro-economic reform, delivering great productivity gains in all sectors of the economy, including on the wharves. The problem we have in this House is that there has been micro-economic reform on this side of the House but not on the other side of the House, with a front bench that reminds us of Jurassic Park. Those opposite have been in opposition for 12 years and there has not been one new idea in that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been tremendous reform on the wharves under this government. The stevedoring reform which was completed in 1992 did bring and achieve major efficiency gains. Labour productivity doubled, contrary to what the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) said earlier, and stevedoring charges have fallen by 25 per cent. There has been a continuing improvement on the waterfront ever since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts speak for themselves. If you look at movements per hour at the five Australian ports from March 1991 to March 1995, they have gone from 14.6 per hour to 19.9 per hour. If you look at total containers moved between September 1992 and March 1995, they have gone from 251,000 to 421,000; an increase of some 70 per cent. They are the facts. That is the record&mdash;a very substantial productivity improvement&mdash;but not a policy from those opposite. It is best summed up by a Nicholson cartoon which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> some time ago. It shows the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) sitting there with his little hat on his head saying, `We're keeping our policies under our hat.' That sums up your position on micro-economic reform. It sums up your position on the economy. It sums up why you are so irrelevant to the political and economic debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason there needs to be micro-economic reform on the front bench of those opposite is that, when you look at the figures, you will see they are generally older and they have served much longer than those on this side of the House and those in the ministry. If you look at the length of time spent in the ministry and in the shadow ministry: for the government, 27 per cent of its personnel have served for more than five years; 45 per cent for the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Isn't it a disgrace? The Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has a matter of public importance, a matter of national importance, because we have a national disruption to activities on the waterfront. We have shut down activities in Western Australia. But where is the minister? He came in for a division but he sends the water boy in to do the job. The water boy, the member for Lilley (Mr Swan), just gave one of his very best speeches, because it was one of his shortest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this debate, which has turned into a farce, ought to be about today is productivity and competition. The debate is really about the union's closed shop and the fact that the Maritime Union of Australia controls all labour on the waterfront in Australia. We have a monopoly. We have no competition and, as a result, we have no increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the union will not accept any challenge to its monopoly labour rights on the wharves. The issue before us is that BAAC is an employer that does not require its employees to be members of a union. BAAC does not demand that they join the MUA before they can have a job. To my mind, that gives us some competition finally&mdash;and for the first time competitively&mdash;in Australia on the wharves. So we have an opportunity to really address the issue of productivity. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 22 May reported that John Coombs, the National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the union would not allow non-union labour on Fremantle wharves or any other wharf in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Here we have a situation which is straight-out industrial warfare because we have legal coverage and it appears to me that what this individual&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Buckeridge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is seeking to do is replace that right of ours with non-union labour . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>Well fancy that! Fancy the waterfront union having to face competition! What has this government done to the manufacturers of Australia? Has it made them face competition? Has it reduced the tariff wall? Has it said that we must have competition between our employers so that we have effective increases in productivity, so that we can go out and join the world market and so that we can enjoy, theoretically, a higher standard of living?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government speaks with forked tongue. It speaks with two mouths because, on the one hand, it demands that we have competition in the industrial sector and, on the other hand, it ties employers' hands behind their backs and forces them to give preference to union members. That is really what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Transport, who is not here to debate this issue today, brought before this House his Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Section 170DF of the Industrial Relations Act arises out of an amendment put up by the opposition, which the minister finally accepted. That section simply says that an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for a whole range of reasons, one of which is paragraph (c), non-membership of a union or an association. That is good. It says you cannot sack a worker because the worker is a member of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) put up another amendment to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill which proposed that section 122 of the Industrial Relations Act be repealed. Section 122 is, straight-out, a whole series of clauses giving the Industrial Relations Commission the power to grant preference to unions. It says that, under any circumstances, union members&mdash;and, in this case, the Maritime Union of Australia&mdash;shall have preference over anyone else in any work situation on the wharves in Australia. How on earth that fosters competition is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer report, which this government has adopted with both hands and both feet, said that the states have to now provide competition in their utilities and in their transport services because costs to industry are too high. If we are going to be competitive in the world market, then we need competitive input costs into industry. That is reasonable. But the government at the same time ties the hands of those on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supposed to be increasing productivity. As the shadow minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), so easily proved today, productivity is not rising&mdash;in fact, it is falling&mdash;on the waterfront. So we have this great con job by the government. After the expenditure of some $430 million by industry going into the pockets of those on the wharves, we are supposed to have improved efficiency and improved productivity, but instead we have the antithesis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a report which refers to Captain Setchell of Conaust and a meeting between John Coombs, the head of the Maritime Union, and Richard Setchell. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We've had enough," Setchell told Coombs. The company was moving only 14 containers an hour in Sydney&mdash;the barometer for the waterfront&mdash;and it should have been moving 24.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition in question time yesterday, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Leader of the Opposition has championed in his whole political life is to hop into the wages of the low paid, hop into the wages of people under about $30,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA>Setchell says the average waterside worker earns about $70,000 a year&mdash;although the Minister for Transport says he has information that indicates that it is something like $75,000&mdash;and wharf supervisors are in the $100,000 to $120,000 range. If the Leader of the Opposition was supposed to have been attacking the ordinary wage earner in Australia when he said that we needed some competition on the wharves, when he said it was fine for us to get rid of protection for industry in Australia, why can we not get rid of protection for the union movement in Australia? That really is the basic issue. This is about protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, or at least we have been told by government, that protection did not work for Australia, that if we got rid of the huge tariff wall that we have hidden behind for so long there would be a basket of riches for us. We have yet to see the employment opportunities generated in this country promised to us by this Labor government as it whacked down the tariff wall and as it drove much of our manufacturing industry out of business. We do not yet have the results on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we do not have those results is that the government has refused to deregulate the labour market. It has refused to consider the issue of protection of labour. How on earth is industry supposed to compete with companies overseas when they have this old-fashioned, antiquated industrial relations system stuck somewhere in a time warp in between a fully centralised, command driven model and an enterprise bargaining model which we on this side of the House have proposed for so long. The issue arises because this government does not have the intestinal fortitude to act in the manner in which it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the closed shop violates our right to freedom of association. There are four basic freedoms in Australia that we ought to hold dear: the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly, the freedom of religion and the freedom of association. But we do not have freedom of association because this government refuses time and again to do away with preference clauses, the right of unionists over non-unionists, in the industrial workplace. The issue before us today which relates to the wharves in Fremantle is all about voluntary union membership, productivity, competition and the inability of this government to address these issues in a modern and responsible manner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic of the MPI today is said to be `The failure of the Government to undertake genuine micro-economic reform of the waterfront' and refers to `an inefficient closed union shop'. It is interesting to look at the facts of this matter, which is something those opposite have assiduously refused to do. The government's waterfront industry reform package, which came into effect in 1991-92, contained over $400 million in reforms and included over $165 million from the federal government. Recently the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics found that in 1993 alone the benefits which flowed to the owners of non-bulk cargo as a result of the program totalled over $250 million&mdash;$267 million to be precise&mdash;and the reforms affecting bulk cargoes, such as grain and fertiliser, save nearly a further $10 million per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) made the point in his interrupted speech, between 1990 and 1993 container terminal charges fell by 24 per cent. When we look at the crane rates throughout Australian ports, we see an improvement from March 1991 to March 1995. We find that the average crane rate of the five main ports improved from 14.6 in March of 1991 to 19.9 in March 1995. Throughout the various ports the improvement in crane rates between those dates is: Brisbane, 13.3 to 18.4; Sydney, 14.2 to 18.9; Melbourne, 15 to 20.8; Adelaide, 16.1 to 21.5; and Fremantle, which has been the subject of some comment today and will be the subject of some comment from me, 15.5 to 20.2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total number of containers that were handled in those five ports&mdash;to use the correct terminology, they are TEUs, but in layman's language they are containers&mdash;in September 1992 was just over 250,000, or 251,281 to be exact. In March 1995 the total was 421,290&mdash;an improvement, if we use September 1992 as a base, of 67.6 per cent. They are the facts. That is the measure of the improvement which has occurred in this area, which has been the subject of a micro-economic reform package from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the micro-economic reform package of those opposite? It has been a single mantra chant for all issues: slash wages and do away with the award safety nets. That is precisely what the issue at Fremantle is all about. On this issue we have seen press releases in recent days from the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). In a press release of 29 May he refers to `BAAC's competitive tender' and states `Stateships has opted for the most competitive tender'. His final paragraph states `not Stateships or the WA Government, who are simply seeking a genuinely competitive waterfront'. Here we find the shadow minister for transport handcuffed to BAAC, Stateships and the WA government operation in Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find that the second last paragraph of a press release of 26 May by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith)&mdash;it is his usual lengthy release&mdash;refers to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and says that `he should now publicly endorse' and goes on to refer to `BAAC's waterfront operation'. So what is the coalition's micro-economic reform in this area? It is that which is currently being adopted by the Minister for Transport and the Court government in Western Australia. On this issue members opposite have handcuffed themselves to the Court government in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the history of this matter in Fremantle? In early 1995 the state Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, rang the Fremantle Port Authority and suggested that it lease space on the waterfront to Len Buckeridge's BAAC. This was a company which was basically at the time a shell company. It had no materials for handling equipment, no workers, no trained staff and no expertise. Its sole qualification in this area was that of Len Buckeridge himself: a longstanding, well-known Liberal Party supporter and donor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At about the same time we discovered that it was suggested to the Fremantle Port Authority that BAAC should become the owners or the users of a crane which the Fremantle Port Authority had suggested to Patrick Partners, another stevedoring company, it should dispose of on the Fremantle wharf because the crane was not big enough to effectively operate in those conditions. So here we find the tinkering on the telephone of the state minister when he suggested to the Fremantle Port Authority that space should be leased to a company whose only qualification in this area was that it was a Liberal Party donor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we discovered in the last two weeks? The tender for this stevedoring contract was basically done over the phone by the state minister Mr Charlton. So what is the Liberal Party's notion of micro-economic reform on the waterfront? It is that a coalition minister can pick up the telephone and fiddle a tender in favour of a well-known Liberal Party supporter and donor. That is the coalition's view of micro-economic reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This history is well known. It has been documented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and the media. As a result of that tender process we discover this announcement&mdash;I am referring to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> headed `Watchdog probes Stateships deal':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE State Supply Commission will investigate the award of a $2 million Stateships stevedoring contract to building magnate Len Buckeridge.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 7 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, at the bottom of a story entitled `Diary of a debacle', there is a separate story on the state minister for services, Kevin Minson, headed `We might not act on probe advice: Minson', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no guarantee of State Government action on an inquiry into the Stateships' controversial tendering process, Services Minister Kevin Minson said today.</PARA>
<PARA>The story goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The West Australian</EMPHASIS> revealed last week that the State Supply Commission was investigating the tendering process in which Stateships agreed to use the stevedoring services of BAAC Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>Why would the Western Australian Court government not act on the advice of that probe? Because the state Minister for Transport picked up the phone and tinkled with the tender in favour of a Liberal Party donor. Those are the essential facts in these matters. In the story `Diary of a debacle', we find a series of quotes from the state Minister for Transport&mdash;the telephone tinkerer&mdash;who on 22 May said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . BAAC's was successful because of the reduction in price.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 May he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To my knowledge Stateships did not follow State supply guidelines. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asked if it was true that the tender was done by ringing companies for quotes, Mr Charlton said: That's right.</PARA>
<PARA>On Friday, 26 May, after the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had recommended that the union go back to work and recommended to Stateships that the Patricks stevedoring company be used to fulfil the requirements, Mr Charlton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an act of good faith and in the interests of the State, we will agree with Commissioner Laing's request that there be a return to the previous status (union labour to be used on Stateships vessels). In return, we want an immediate return to work. We cannot have the State being held to ransom by the unions, so the cooling-off period will be vital to reach agreement on the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>The union went back to work immediately; and they are still back at work. What did Eric Charlton do? Over the weekend he spoke to either Richard Court or Len Buckeridge, or he was spoken to by Richard Court or spoken to by Len Buckeridge, and on Sunday night reversed that decision. So we had a complete turnaround. Why? Because the telephone tinkering minister has only one qualification or one criteria in this matter: the  group, the company, the individual to whom this tender went is a well-known Liberal Party supporter and a well-known Liberal Party donor. There is another connection here which is worth questioning. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 25 May states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stateships acting general manager Chris Dayton said he had been satisfied during the tender process that BAAC was capable of carrying out the work.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a mob, an outfit, that had no previous experience and had no skilled workers. Chris Dayton was previously employed in the office of the shadow minister for industrial relations on the following occasions: October 1992 to February 1993; May 1994; June 1994; and, finally, September 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the former staffer of the shadow minister for industrial relations has been in contact with his boss either seeking advice or proffering advice on this matter. We have seen the statement from the shadow minister for industrial relations, which basically endorses the approach of the state government in this matter. So we see the federal contact here; we see the coalition handcuffed to micro-economic reform policy on the waterfront. What is that micro-economic reform policy? To telephone tinker with a state tender for the benefit of a Liberal Party donor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Based on estimates for 1995-96, individual income taxes will have increased by 172.5 per cent at 30 June 1996; company tax by 370 per cent; and indirect taxes by 149.8 per cent. These figures are part of an overall increase in the total revenue to be collected by Labor over its 13 budgets of 178 per cent, excluding the proceeds of assets sales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government tells us that we live in a low tax country. Yet, with good reason, very few believe it. Tax increases during Labor's 13 long years on the treasury bench will have, after the 1995-96 financial year, outstripped the rate of inflation by an average of 9.3 per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of the higher rates of taxation Australians now pay are the ever escalating compliance costs. The compliance costs in this country are the highest in the Western world, with only the possible exception of the United States of America. These compliance costs are only going to be higher still after the increase in the company tax rate to 36c in the dollar. Before the 1993 election, our Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of a dynamic East-Asian growth region, and with increasing strength in education and training and research and development, Australia is well poised to take advantage of these trends. Our integration into the Asian regional economy, however, means that we need to compare ourselves not just with OECD members but with regional competitors for new manufacturing and large-scale processing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister claimed that to aid this integration the government would cut the company tax rate from 39 to 33 per cent. He said that this would encourage firms to invest out of increased retained earnings and improve the competitiveness of Australia's business tax regime compared with our regional neighbours. If the words of the Prime Minister were so true then, why do they not apply now? With the cut in the rate of company tax, the government introduced a new quarterly instalment system. That was part of the trade-off; that was the stick to go with the carrot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now companies will be hit with a double whammy because they will still have to meet the accelerated payment schedules as well as pay the high rate of tax. The compliance costs will also be higher because companies will have to maintain three franking accounts, reflecting the tax payable at the three different rates. As Mr Geoffrey Lehmann stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 21 April 1995, this will make a complete joke of tax simplification. Labor promised tax cuts, lower compliance costs and simpler law. What it delivers is the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has made significant changes to the superannuation system by making employees contribute towards their own superannuation. The main objective of this change is to bolster national savings. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), touched on this. I want to add a word of caution. In the FitzGerald report it is made very clear who the main culprit in this decline is when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main contributor to our long term decline in national saving is a decline in public sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA>That is governments. This major structural decline FitzGerald traced back to the excesses of the Whitlam years, but it is clear that the government has made a substantial contribution of its own to lower national saving levels in recent times. While the government has been claiming that the deterioration in public sector saving has been cyclical in nature, Dr FitzGerald has made it clear that this slide has been anything but cyclical. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main cause of the fall in our saving performance is not cyclical factors (as saving is still low even after recovering) but underlying structural factors&mdash;particularly the structural decline in public sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr FitzGerald noted that reversing this structural decline in our national savings will require a major effort on the part of the public sector to restore public sector finances. It is one thing to rabbit on about the contribution near universal superannuation will make to a sadly depleted national saving effort. However, it is quite another matter to be certain that mandatory superannuation will not merely become a substitute for other forms of private saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look to contemporary experience with Medicare for an inkling of what might eventuate if the extravagant claims being made for compulsory superannuation are not toned down and tempered by reality. With Medicare there always was, and is increasingly, a mentality amongst taxpayers either that because the levy is compulsory it is all that individuals need to pay to provide for the cost of their health care or that, because the amount of money conscripted by way of the levy is perceived to be so high, there need be no further contribution to the cost of personal health care. The increase in the levy in the budget period will do nothing to modify such attitudes. Whether increasing numbers will continue to opt out of private health insurance is yet to be seen, although it seems likely under the present regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar reaction would not be a surprise amongst workers forced to contribute to superannuation funds. There will almost certainly be an element which decides that, because of being in superannuation funds and being credited with three or five per cent or increasing amounts of income, there is no need to set aside further amounts by way of savings to provide for retirement income. As the balances in those accounts is increased to thousands and tens of thousands of dollars over coming years, the unrealisable expectations of individuals will arguably grow commensurately. Any assumption that compulsory superannuation will add to total savings and not be merely a substitute for other existing forms of savings should be heavily discounted. Equally, the expectations of present-day workers that their retirement needs are being adequately catered for should be constantly played down&mdash;not the opposite, as is now the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime objective of compulsory superannuation is clear and will be enhanced by the changes foreshadowed in the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis). They will further tighten the grip of the union movement on superannuation. These employee contributions are not to be legislated as most would expect. Instead, they will be negotiated on an award basis, thereby enhancing the power of the union movement. Introducing employee contributions in this fashion will restrict coverage to only 74 per cent of the working population, not the 87 per cent currently covered by the superannuation guarantee charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, this proposal will further restrict the fundamental right of all workers to exercise the freedom to choose their own superannuation funds. This is a basic issue which Australian working people are increasingly demanding action on. Labor cannot deliver, but the coalition is committed to providing choice to all in the provision of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it be in the style of retirement savings accounts, traditional forms of superannuation or other products yet to be developed, all Australians should have a choice. Australia needed this budget, and the previous one, to deliver real hope of sustainable economic recovery. Labor has demonstrated once again that it simply cannot grasp the nettle. Tighter fiscal policy and a structural surplus, not this asset sale induced mirage, are required to push down, and keep down, real interest rates and lessen the pressure on the disgraceful balance of payments figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuous debt accumulation, which our children will have to pay off, is an issue of such importance that it needs to be tackled in a realistic fashion. This budget's fraudulent surplus is achieved by the sale of national assets. The way in which the proceeds from the sale of these assets are to be used, to fund recurrent expenditure and not to repay our debt, is disturbing. This is a flagrant waste of our national assets, which have taken many years to develop and accumulate. The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry put it well this month when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is not irresponsible in planning to sell its assets, but in how it plans to use the money. The states now generally recognise that revenue from asset sales should be used to either retire debt or to purchase replacement assets&mdash;either of which maintains their net assets. The Commonwealth's revenue from asset sales is being used entirely to finance current expenditure. This leads to the erosion of the government's&mdash;or rather, Australia's&mdash;net assets. The budget is not only fiscally irresponsible, it is irresponsible in a wider and more important sense. It does nothing to sustain Australia's economic growth now the cyclical rebound from recession is over.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian people have now done 12 years of hard Labor. The government totally lacks any understanding of what the mainstream of Australian society wants. Whether it be sound economic policy, choice in superannuation or simple old-fashioned honesty, the current government simply can no longer be expected to deliver even if it ever could. It has destroyed all its political capital. It remains in government not out of a sense of duty for what it can do for the Australian people, but only for the naked pursuit of the privileges of office. The electorate will get a chance to condemn it for that in the very near future.</PARA>

But I was surprised, and I must say a little disappointed, when the honourable member for Bennelong came in here and said nothing.

Here is a person who is saying that he is the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. God help us, but this is the alternative front bench, the alternative ministry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an age when more and more enterprises are within the private sector, and in an age when there is much discussion, most of it ill-informed and misrepresented, regarding the trade union movement, there is a very important role for government to ensure the protection of workers' rights and entitlements. At a time when many commentators are talking about the economic impact of superannuation funds and how these funds will be managed and invested, there are some very disturbing incidents of workers losing those superannuation fund entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my office I am dealing with several cases now where unscrupulous bosses, although deducting superannuation payments, have masked these contributions in such a way that when their businesses are placed in receivership the workers lose out on their award entitlement or superannuation. If it is good enough for the government to ensure that there are inspectors or other avenues to enforce compliance in the workplace with equal opportunity or sexual harassment legislation then, in my view, surely it is not too much to expect that workers' superannuation entitlements will be safeguarded; in other words, that they will be paid by the employer when they are working and paid out by the employer if a business goes into receivership, as sometimes happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent months, three high profile businesses in the Illawarra have been placed into receivership with the workers being denied their award entitlement, such as wages, accrued annual leave, long service leave and superannuation. UFI Pools was a local swimming pool manufacturing company located at Yallah in my electorate. UFI was placed into receivership a couple of months ago. There was some hope among the local unions that a rescue package involving investment from a Chinese source could be gained to keep the company operating as a going concern. Unfortunately, this hope was not sustained. The Chinese investment source pulled out and UFI closed its operation. There has been an occupation of the UFI site by former employees, and an official picket line was established to ensure that no equipment was removed from the site and that former employees would be paid their full award entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a letter from one of my constituents whose husband was employed at UFI Pools. He was concerned about award entitlements. I have taken the concerns of my constituent up with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) and the Australian Taxation Office. The constituent claimed&mdash;and there is some debate about this&mdash;that since October last year the super contributions were in arrears for a substantial time. In her letter my constituent said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rang National Mutual again when my husband's employment with UFI was terminated on 9 February 1995, and again when the company went into liquidation on 22 February 1995. National Mutual would produce a letter of claim to the liquidator and when the assets were sold, funds would be equally distributed among the employees&mdash;regardless whether they were outstanding employee's contributions which were taken out of wages or unpaid employer contributions.</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent finished her letter to me by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would urge the Federal Minister responsible for Superannuation to put tighter government controls on superannuation to avoid complications of this kind in the future, and to protect Australia's workers peaceful retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>This last sentiment is one with which nobody could disagree. We are dealing with the workers' nest eggs&mdash;the money which they will have to retire on. It is the money which they will depend on when they leave the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago the Clutha coal mine in the Burragorang Valley&mdash;which is in the electorate of Macarthur, but many of the workers live in my electorate&mdash;closed down, leaving workers high and dry, with close to $18 million in award entitlements suddenly disappearing from the company books. I understand from a report in Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the Australian Securities Commission is investigating capital raisings conducted by Clutha Ltd in the month before the company shares were suspended and an administrator appointed. Clutha Ltd was placed into the hands of Coopers and Lybrand's administrator Tony Sherlock in February, after operational difficulties at the mine and after two years of losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great issue here, as I said earlier, is that there is a great deal of uninformed comment on the role of the trade union movement. That is very bad, deficient corporate management. The Clutha mine management mismanaged a coalmine on which a town depends. It has mismanaged the working and social lives of an entire community, adversely affecting the lives of nearly 1,000 families by creating this uncertain future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uncertainty of the position of the Clutha miners is made worse by the fact that at the moment they do not have a job. Even worse, somebody has ensured that $18 million of legal award entitlements&mdash;such as wages, superannuation, annual leave and long service leave among other things&mdash;have been lost or gone missing. Not only do these workers and their families have no livelihood; they have nothing to show for the work they have conducted at the coalmine in the Burragorang Valley over the years they have hauled and mined coal from these pits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CFMEU officials in the southern district&mdash;such as Barney Fittler and Bruce Watson&mdash;have shown tremendous leadership by setting up what are termed checkpoints. They are staffed 24 hours a day by the miners who used to work on the other side of the gate until Clutha closed down. The checkpoints ensure that no equipment is removed from the mine. The mining equipment will be slowly recovered from the mine and will hopefully recover a sound price so that these miners and their families can see all of that $18 million they are legally and morally owed. The target is for 100c in the dollar return on the sale of this equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also going to cost a significant amount of money to realise a recovery of the valuable mining equipment from below the earth at the Clutha pits. The question is: why does this kind of activity have to be conducted by a union like the CFMEU so that the workers can recover what should have been theirs in the first place; that is, their legal award conditions and entitlements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was the Clutha mine management allowed to get away with the disappearance of nearly $18 million in workers' entitlements? Why was UFI Pools&mdash;which I made reference to earlier&mdash;allowed to fall into arrears with its employer superannuation contributions for nearly 12 months? Why is the Corporations Law so easily found to be full of loopholes when a perfumed, silk pocket-handkerchiefed lawyer or accountant looks at the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it outrageous that workers have to occupy a pool site and guard against the removal of assets so that they have at least a chance of receiving what is rightfully theirs. I find it equally outrageous that Clutha mineworkers and their union&mdash;the CFMEU&mdash;have to engage in what could be a long three- to six-month campaign to recover equipment from the mine pit, bring it to the surface and hope that someone will buy it to raise money to pay workers' entitlements which should already have been provided for in the company's books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, I hope that some kind of negotiation can be successfully concluded to reopen the Clutha mine&mdash;which has a significant reserve potential&mdash;and put those miners in the Burragorang Valley back to work, mining Australia's prime export and supporting their families and their local community. Many in the opposition would not know this. They would not know a coalminer or a wharfie if they tripped over one. They are the most down-to-earth people you could meet. They are straight up and down. They look at issues in terms that are black and white. They tell you directly what they think and what should happen. Last week they told me that they wanted their award entitlements and they wanted that mine reopened and operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the concern that I have over these two receiverships in the Illawarra, I have convened a meeting on Friday, 9 June in my office with leading Illawarra trade union officials to discuss their experiences in these closures, the subsequent losses their members have experienced and the possible changes that are required to ensure that entitlements of workers are not threatened again. One of the prime issues to consider, in my view, is that union officials should be given the right to simply walk onto a site and demand to inspect a company's books. At the moment, until the law is repealed by the New South Wales Carr government, unionists have to give a crazy seven days notice to employers in order to inspect a company's books, and we all know what happens in those seven days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other issue to discuss is the change to corporations legislation so that companies are required to make yearly provisions for superannuation, annual leave and long service leave. This is already done by companies through the taxation system when paying company tax, for example. Another issue is the change in the Corporations Law which would make it possible for a parent company to be pursued when its subsidiary goes into receivership and leaves behind a mountain of debt and unpaid amounts to the workers. These are issues I will be discussing on Friday week in my office with some of the leading trade union officials in the Illawarra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on the subject of superannuation, I have recently had a number of constituents complain about the administration fees imposed by superannuation funds eating away at their superannuation lump sum, especially when it is a very small amount of money. One of my constituents only last week sent a letter which I am following up. When I read it, the complaints were spot-on about what various people had already complained to me about. The letter was not detailed. It did not go on for pages and pages, but it did address the issue in a brief and totally accurate way. The letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year I taught a Migrant English class at the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre in Wollongong. This was for an agreed 5 week period. I was paid salary and the Superannuation Basic benefit was fulfilled with the money being sent to the Hesta Super Fund in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent contacted the HESTA super fund requesting that her superannuation basic benefit be sent to her, as it was only a small amount and she believed&mdash;rightly&mdash;that she was entitled to it. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was informed that the amount had been only $22.80. From this sum had been taken 15 percent tax and the balance had gone up to help cover the Fund's administration fee in excess of $23.00. What a farce&mdash;and what a concern! . . . Are short term casual workers to be nothing more or less than income sources for parasitic super funds to suck from?</PARA>
<PARA>Quite right is my reaction. I am particularly pleased that the government has introduced new rules to protect small superannuation balances from 1 July 1995. As of that time&mdash;as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, would be aware, having just made a speech on superannuation&mdash;small superannuation accounts receiving superannuation guarantee or award contributions will receive member protection. I would expect, as does the government, that some superannuation funds protect small balanced accounts; in fact, some superannuation funds have already decided to give member protection to small balanced accounts even before this new legislation is passed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 20 years Australia has slipped from 10th place to 18th place in the world in per capita income. One hundred years ago we were the richest country in the world. Our real interest rates are among the highest in the developed world. High mortgage rates have played a significant role in the Canberra by-election, as members opposite would fully realise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rate rises are a very potent political factor in this parliament and in the electorate at large. The fundamental approach of the government in this budget is to bring about a perception that interest rates will remain as they are and will not go up. We await the outcome of all those market related activities in relation to interest rate rises and where they might be on election day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cause of the slide is not a failure of the market, as sometimes the government would have us believe; it is a failure of government. The symptoms of Australia's current position are high unemployment, high real interest rates, a dismal level of national savings, a record current account deficit&mdash;it was $2.1 billion yesterday&mdash;and a burgeoning foreign debt. These are all matters which members on this side of the House have referred to in their budget discussions. For every one of these conspicuous symptoms of government failure, the ALP constructs big government plans to rectify the situation. These illusory bureaucratic solutions typically win votes in the short term but see Australia's long-term prospects sinking further into the economic mire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time last year we were debating the 1994-95 budget and the Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. At that time there was concern about the unemployment levels of 11 1/2 per cent throughout the rest of Australia. Working Nation was considered to be the answer. Again, it was a major proposition by the government to alleviate a fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The backdrop was an unemployment problem caused by gross government policy failure: an overregulated labour market, an inefficient tax system, costly business regulation and a disastrous high interest rate policy in the late 1980s. But the solution put forward was more government, not less. Personal responsibility and initiative were overlooked in favour of an assortment of new training schemes, wage subsidies, individual case management under the Working Nation program and a new regulatory authority, the ESRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's answer was a $6.3 billion spending program on Working Nation, and we have yet to see the results. This year the priority is national savings and superannuation. The inadequacy of national savings is again a failure of government policy: large social spending programs and taxes which penalise thrift and continual public sector overspending. But, once again, Labor's answer is more  government, not less. This time the panacea is a massive compulsory system of superannuation which will see government directing workers' earnings to be returned at retirement age. Private savings and personal responsibility take the back seat to government intrusion and compulsion from central authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2000 employees will be contributing a compulsory three per cent of their income to superannuation. By the year 2002 their employers will be contributing nine per cent. But the real cause of our poor saving record is that every facet of government policy acts to discourage saving, and the Commonwealth seems intent on setting the worst possible example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government shows no fiscal responsibility. High underlying budget deficits are inexcusable in these four years of supposed economic recovery. This year the underlying Commonwealth government deficit is $8.23 billion, as revealed towards the back of the budget papers&mdash;not the $716 million surplus that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) would claim that the government had brought down in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a budget which was supposed to address national savings, the government has increased real spending by 1.7 per cent. This is partially offset by a nine per cent revenue increase&mdash;the second highest since the Whitlam government&mdash;with bracket creep on income tax payers and the next round of former Treasurer Dawkins's wholesale sales tax rises which will take effect on 1 July. The wholesale sales tax was at 10, 20 and 30 per cent. One per cent was added on last year. Now there is the insidious effect of the further one per cent being added on 1 July. So sales tax is being imposed by this government which was so adamantly against the GST of 12 per cent, 22 per cent and 32 per cent after 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the so-called surplus which comes from the pie in the sky $5.3 billion worth of asset sales. This is an increase of 9,000 per cent, and a raft of one-off dividends to help in the balancing of the books. There was an increase of 42 per cent in dividends from Australia Post and Telecom. All of this helped to try to bring about this illusion that the government had balanced the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the lease-back of Dasfleet. The government is claiming the $400 million sale price as revenue, without including the cost of the lease-back arrangements on the outlays side. Again the government was fixing the books. It sold a capital asset but it did not allow for the cost to government of renting the fleet back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just like the Labor government in Victoria that leased its railway rolling stock for $400 million but then had to pay the lease payments. Victorians were appalled and amazed that their own railway system had been leased to the Japanese and they were paying a yearly interest rate rental on that particular rolling stock which they thought was their own. That was all to get a cash flow for the cash-strapped Cain-Kirner governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the asset sales by the Commonwealth do not add to national savings. They simply realise the proceeds of many past years savings that have built up these assets. The special dividends from the government enterprises simply transfer money from those enterprises which are trying to be efficient just to help the Commonwealth government to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr James Cox of the New South Wales Pricing Tribunal estimates, there is an 87 per cent correlation between national savings and government savings. Fiscal responsibility is the single most important factor in boosting overall savings, but an underlying $8.23 billion deficit does not achieve this aim or encourage average Australians to save more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look again at the compulsory superannuation program and compulsory saving, we see that, having failed to cut its own spending or possibly save for the future, the government's answer is to compel individuals to do it on its behalf. Compulsory superannuation is little more than a draconian measure involving the forced removal of income today to be returned at retirement age. It takes away individual responsibility for long-term financial planning and replaces it with government decree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compulsory superannuation contributions commence with a phased-in nine per cent employer contribution by the year 2002, the addition of up to three per cent employee contributions and dollar for dollar contributions from the government to match the employee input. That last dollar for dollar is a mechanism by the government just to encourage employees to join the scheme and join this superannuation arrangement which the government is proposing in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Terry McCrann pointed out in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 14 May, whereas the One Nation l-a-w tax cuts were to provide $1.8 billion in 1996-97 and over $4 billion each year thereafter, the government's super contributions only cut in in 1998, meaning that by the year 2002 taxpayers will be swindled out of $17 billion. Mr Terry McCrann is regarded as a very reliable economic commentator by both sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts, which we were supposed to get now, will be received in as many as 45 years time. Those tax cuts&mdash;which were to be put into law, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said on many occasions&mdash;have now gone and will never be recovered under this government. A real savings strategy would rely on encouraging voluntary savings, rather than the government dictating what people's consumption patterns should be. In the current context, is it any wonder that Australians are not saving enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Savings are not attractive to Australians because when governments run large public programs there is no incentive for individuals to save for their old age, illness, injury, looking after their children's education or future unemployment. The government has taken over all these responsibilities, which of course costs a considerable amount of taxpayers' dollars. Section 2, page 46 of the budget papers concede this point. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases in social security arrangements over the past two decades may also have lowered the perceived need of individuals to save for periods of reduced income such as retirement, or the need to provide for education or health services.</PARA>
<PARA>Young people aged between 24 and 34 make up 22 per cent of the population, pay 25 per cent of total taxation but receive only 14 per cent of benefits gained from government spending. They need not save for retirement, as long as they observe people over 65 paying five per cent of tax but receiving 28 per cent of government benefits. They observe the example of the older members of our community receiving large government handouts and hope they will be in the same position&mdash;so why should they save for their own individual programs? They know that throughout their whole adult life they need not save very much because the government will pick up the cost of their health, the cost of their children's education and, of course, the risk of illness, injury or unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, the government will pay for education. For tertiary students, the government pays an average of 77 per cent of the cost of a university course. Twenty-three per cent is paid through the HECS program, which means that the student has some responsibility to make some contribution to the cost. In 1995-96 this represents a subsidy of about $8,060 per student each year that the government provides for tertiary education. Meanwhile Austudy and Abstudy provide $1.8 billion, which is purely a tertiary education subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the same trend again for health. Big government has brought about a situation whereby it will help individual Australians get through any of their health problems. The government, through Medicare, picks up 85 per cent of the schedule fee for out-of-hospital services and 75 per cent for in-hospital services. The Medicare funding agreements between the Commonwealth and the states require state governments to offer free public hospital access to all Australian residents. Even high income earners who could be saving to pay a modest fee for public hospital treatment are told not to bother&mdash;`It's all right, the state will pay, the government will pay; it will be taken off other taxpayers.' Sixty-nine per cent of Medicare services are bulkbilled&mdash;literally, free to consumers from their point of view because they never see the transfer of any money from their pocket. Nobody could pretend that 69 per cent of Australians are incapable of paying even a modest sum for their health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costly drugs are made available on the cheap. Even the wealthiest in our society this year will pay a maximum of $16.20 per prescription for pharmaceuticals up to a limit of $407, and will pay $2.60 thereafter. Let me draw a comparison. If I purchase some fresh fruit or a pair of running shoes to enhance my health, those items are regarded as a private consumption choice. But if I visit the doctor or get a pharmaceutical prescription the government will see fit to pay 80 or 90 per cent of the cost for me. The government's overwhelming generosity in relieving Australians of their need to save would be commendable if it were not all done with other people's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what happens with the tax situation. To arrange for its extravagant social programs, the government discourages saving by heavily taxing middle income Australians. That is self-evident. As the tax scales move up, middle income Australia cops more and more of the tax burden. A recent EPAC study report found that Australia's tax on savings was 27 per cent higher than the OECD average and 50 times higher than the Asian average. So a reputable report is saying that in Australia there is every disincentive for people to save. That occurs because of our high dependence on individual income tax collections, which have risen by 13 per cent in this budget. This again is a massive increase in the middle income tax area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a strong dependence on company taxation which again has risen by 15 per cent in this budget&mdash;it has risen from a mere 33c to 36c in the dollar. Those companies do not have the capacity to vote with their feet as much as do individual voters. Our top marginal rate is 47 per cent for all incomes above $38,000. By contrast, the top marginal rate in New Zealand is 33 per cent, which allows people in that country to have some incentive to work harder and to create some savings. New Zealand income earners have a better after tax position when they can make these choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the closing minutes, let us look at Australia's savings record. In the mid-1970s household savings as a percentage of GDP were over 15 per cent. Under this Labor government, they have moved down to 8 1/2 per cent. The key barometer&mdash;the very thing that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talk about&mdash;is developing these savings. Under a Labor government they have been halved. In the 1970s, our savings ratio to GDP was equal to the OECD average. In the 1990s, under the Labor government, we are four percentage points below the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's inability to cut spending and its policy of discouraging private savings have led to the proposal for a system of forced savings through compulsory superannuation. We now have the situation of overseas borrowings to make up for that and, of course, we have a credit card society&mdash;we borrow now and pay back later. That is this government's attitude and that is the way it is approaching this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compulsory superannuation diverts private savings from bank accounts to superannuation funds, shifting money from those savings vehicles, but adding nothing to overall savings. Compulsory superannuation only raises savings levels for low income earners who currently are not saving at all. As the well-known and respected commentator Mr Vince FitzGerald said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key element producing increased saving, over the longer term . . . is that it is compulsory, raising the saving of many that without it would not be saving much in any form.</PARA>
<PARA>The low income earners who currently do not save are mostly young people who need to spend all their income on current living expenses. These same people save more as they get older, but they will not save any more than the compulsory amounts in middle age if they feel they have been forced to save too much when younger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are serious prudential problems emerging, which other members have alluded to. Employee contributions will come through the award system, entrenching the position of unions and industry funds. The proposal which has been floated that maritime workers' funds be used to buy shares in the struggling ANL is a classic example. We also have the Prime Minister telling super funds to look at small and medium businesses for investment. They are usually high risk concerns and should not be related to superannuation investments. Super funds are not there for furthering social aims like stimulating employment, picking winners, or buying up state assets to satisfy ideological fantasies. But the outcome will be one result of the heavy-handed, big government approach to savings that are proposed in the current budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at investment, parallel to the savings dilemma is Australia's ageing infrastructure, which can effectively only be replaced through imported capital from overseas&mdash;as evidenced by our $27 billion current account deficit occurring last financial year and being proposed for next financial year. In fact, we find that Australia as a nation is importing its capital to make up for the lack of saving in our own home base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption of capital gains tax on the first home has created a bias in favour of housing investment and luxury housing. The slow pace of micro-economic reform in transport and industrial relations has made property and speculative assets more attractive to investment capital than productive assets made marginally viable by high regulation and costs of inputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Helen Hughes in her study <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achieving full employment</EMPHASIS> says that many small business people eventually decide to fold up and invest their capital in property, become employees or accept social security. For instance, she estimates that the opening of a coffee shop today would require as many as 20 separate licences and permits, posing a disincentive to invest in such concerns. Is it any wonder that, with such investment disincentives, growth in the overall capital stock has fallen from around six per cent of GDP in the 1960s to 2.5 per cent in 1995?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am concerned about, as a member of the opposition and as an Australian citizen, is that this government is providing big solutions of government activity to overcome the major problem of saving in the future, which I concede, and the problem of achieving full employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget produced some very good figures; it was very well received in the community&mdash;and the coalition hates it. You can tell that from the speeches its members give. I will give some of the figures: a budget surplus of $718 million; gross domestic product to grow by 3.7 per cent; inflation predicted at two to three per cent; employment to grow by three per cent; unemployment expected to fall to eight per cent by mid-1996; business investment to increase by 13 per cent; and&mdash;the thing the coalition hates the most&mdash;real disposable income to increase by 4.25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's share of the nation's wealth as an economic indicator is ignored by those opposite. I refer the House again to the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday when he quoted US Secretary of Labour, Mr Robert Reich. In talking about the US economy, the US Secretary of Labour was quoted in an article by Mr Gittins in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, with the recovery in full bloom, productivity surpassing 2 per cent, corporate profits up 12 per cent, and economic growth exceeding 4 per cent, the median wages of benefits of Americans continued to decline.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gittins's article went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the European ministers complained of very low employment growth, high rates of unemployment and high levels of long-term unemployment. They worried about the "exclusion" of the jobless.</PARA>
<PARA>The only conclusion you can come to from those comments is that the Australian government has got it right and that the coalition, if it were to ever gain government in Australia, would lead us into economic decline. The coalition's policies, if it has got any, would lead to a creation of an underclass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member who preceded me, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), referred to New Zealand. I do not think New Zealand is a very good example of the sorts of policies Australia would want to adopt. We have seen very graphically illustrated very recently the total alienation of the underclass in New Zealand that is often represented by the Maori population. In the United States, it is usually Afro-Americans who suffer. Also, there has been a shift from the north to the sun belt in the south, quite often with right to work legislation, which is very similar, I might say, to Jobsback and the coalition policy. Even in western Europe you have problems with an underclass. In some regards, say in Germany, the underclass&mdash;I do not want to oversimplify things&mdash;are the guest workers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. N.B. Reid)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The member should continue and ignore interjections. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV5">Mr DODD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will, because it was an inane interjection. Anyone who could possibly suggest that Australia has anything like the problems of an underclass, the problems of those people totally alienated from society, as in the United States and in western Europe with guest workers and the backlash by the far right&mdash;I do not condone that in any way&mdash;is way out of touch. Anyone who would suggest that we have the problems New Zealand has in relation to their indigenous population is also way out of touch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a success story in this regard under this government. That is why reconciliation with indigenous groups in Australia is very important&mdash;including an employment strategy so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are included in the government's employment strategy, Working Nation. The accord and the award safety net also ensures that there is a fair share for labour. You have to pay tribute not only to the government but also to the ACTU in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about guest workers, Australia's immigration policy, which is tailored towards employment and economic growth as well as to family reunion, provides an inclusive policy in relation to the labour market. We do not exclude our immigrant workers from the system; we include them. That, I might say, has been a bipartisan policy in this place, and I would hope it would continue. I am not suggesting that the coalition suggests we introduce guest workers, but it is in stark contrast with the overseas situation. I think we have to be very proud of that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of these matters are a direct result of government policy over the last 10 years. All of these policies are working very well in my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. I will refer to some of them specifically because I think it is important for me as the local member to refer to government policy and to how well it is working in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does have a coherent policy, unlike the coalition. The budget does have a coherent strategy, unlike the coalition. I have already mentioned the accord. The budget also emphasises an increase in national savings. Also, the budget, through Working Nation, not only supplements and supports the labour market programs to target the long-term unemployed but also promotes regional development policies to encourage regional growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Labor Party is now the party of the regions of Australia. The National Party still has a zero tariff policy with no other real regional policy. It just tags along behind the Liberals and their economic rationalist policies without any real safety net for regions. That can be contrasted with the government's support for regional development policy, as set out in the budget and the Better Cities program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in question time the coalition spokesperson seemed to suggest that the Better Cities program was somehow just for the major capital cities in Australia. I have news for the coalition because I am going to work very hard to get Better Cities money to Far North Queensland, and I am very confident that I will be able to get it. I am very confident because of our growing economy and the need for infrastructure in that region. Contrast that with the coalition's policy&mdash;zero tariffs with not much else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important part of the government's strategy is industry policy. That is important to ensure diversification of the economy, to develop high performance industries and, of course, to develop export industries which assist with the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining part of my speech I am going to give some examples of how the budget assists my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. I was very pleased in April to have the Prime Minister of Australia come to Cairns to announce a $1.5 million project to train 135 unemployed Far North Queenslanders to meet skills shortages in the region's building industry. This is a pilot project in the general area of jobskills. The plan is the first jobskills project in Australia to train unemployed people for the private sector construction industry. The project is funded by DEET and it will give job seekers the skills and experience needed to be employed in the domestic construction industry. The trainees in the North Queensland project will have six weeks training at TAFE, followed by 20 weeks on-the-job work experience and training with local employers. This combination of on-the-job and formal training has proved highly successful in helping unemployed people back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this is that Cairns experienced a boom in the building and construction sector during 1993, which continued, with nearly $1 billion in proposed commercial projects planned to begin construction in Cairns, in 1994-95. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a need for industry based training, and that had been identified by the industry&mdash;by the industry, I might tell members of the coalition. That is how much out of step they are. This has been done in consultation with the industry. A training need had been identified but short-term courses were not considered an option. Accredited courses were considered the only option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme is an example of the Working Nation project working and providing jobs in the area where they are needed&mdash;filling in skills shortages and giving jobs to the long-term unemployed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV5">Mr DODD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to see that there is a concession that the government programs are working. Just last week, on 23 May, I spoke about the industry program. It was my great pleasure to have the federal Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, in my electorate. He launched nationally the business networks program, which will provide $25 million over four years to assist small to medium sized businesses to form networks. The program will encourage businesses to cooperate in areas of strategic business, including exporting, import substitution, sharing costs of production, research and development and marketing. This is part of the larger government program called Ausindustry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite, referred to the confusion that occurs with business in relation to government programs and the need for a one-stop shop. The government is responding to that through Ausindustry. The coalition is so out of date, though. Small and medium sized business has come to the government and put these propositions, and the government has responded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business networks program is a very important part of Ausindustry and has been established as a major Ausindustry initiative. Ausindustry is part of the federal government's white paper strategy. Ausindustry will provide information and services to companies when they require it. It is Ausindustry's customer service focus and its goal to enhance companies' competitiveness that has led to the development of the business networks program. Seventeen network brokers have been appointed throughout Queensland to assist local businesses to form networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the forum at the same time as the launch by the minister, Terry Grundy of Gateway Asia and Mac Thompson of the CAM group both gave presentations on existing networks in Cairns. It was very interesting to hear Terry Grundy's discussion because he is involved in a group which is exporting medical services to South-East Asia. Mac Thompson, whom I know very well and commend, is the consultant to the Far North Queensland export group which represents and assists companies that share a common goal in providing quality products to the Asia-Pacific region. This group already has an annual turnover of more than $80 million and is seeking export opportunities for its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I had the pleasure of visiting a lot of members of that group with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). The idea of the business networks program will be to formalise and expand those sorts of networks right throughout Australia. That is why it is very significant that the program was launched in Cairns in my electorate. In a lot of ways the business community in Cairns, with the support of the government and in consultation and partnership with the government, has developed these networks to a greater extent than they have been developed in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook also announced that nine national research grants would be awarded to people who can provide information that will further enhance the business network program. The first national research grant, worth $15,000, was presented to Professor Allan Buttery of James Cook University on that day. Professor Buttery recently released the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business networking</EMPHASIS>. Once again, in Far North Queensland, in my electorate of Leichhardt, the government's programs are working. They are not working, as the previous speaker suggested, in contradiction to business; they are working with business. That is what those opposite do not like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, we are now the party of regional development, the party that represents a whole range of those in the community. We not only represent the disadvantaged in the community&mdash;which we do very well&mdash;but also represent those in the community that are generating economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people know that in my electorate in Far North Queensland tourism is a major industry. I would always emphasise the need for diversification. Tourism is important. It is significant that both Senator Cook and the Prime Minister before him visited NQEA in Far North Queensland, which is the region's largest private manufacturer producing ships. We looked at a barge that NQEA is making for the McArthur River project. I was recently on a wave piercer that was produced for Quicksilver. NQEA is obviously part of the diversification of manufacturing in my electorate and is obviously a very important part of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also recognises the tourism industry. The budget was very good for the tourism industry. I will go through some of the programs. There was $80 million for the Australian Tourist Commission for overseas marketing activities, $5.2 million for the regional tourism development program and $3.4 million for the national ecotourism program and the forest ecotourism program&mdash;I understand that the minister is going to make an announcement about the former next week. There was $0.7 million for sites of national tourism significance. I was pleased that the Cook Shire Council received money from that for the viewing platform for Aboriginal cave paintings at Laura in my electorate. There was $2.6 million to stimulate the development of special interest tourism markets, including rural tourism, the backpacker market and cruise shipping, all very significant for my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is ongoing support for the Tourism Forecasting Council, $1.3 million for the Bureau of Tourism Research and $762 million for the construction of international and domestic airport facilities for Sydney's west in time for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. That will be very significant for Far North Queensland. If people come to visit the Olympics, they will almost certainly also want to visit Cairns and the far north. There is provision of funding for extension of the export market development grants scheme to all tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are only the direct things in the budget that assist the tourism industry. There is also the funding for environment, culture and recreation. This includes $14 million for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for planning and environmental management functions caused by increased use of the reef, and increased funding of $6 million for the national protection areas program, which includes the management of national parks. There is the statement that Senator Faulkner made this week on coastal policy. There is also an amount of $3.9 million to conserve Australia's wilderness and wild rivers; that is relevant to my electorate. It is certainly relevant to Cape York Peninsula in my electorate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to have the opportunity to make a few comments on the 1995 budget in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96. I note the previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), touched on it in a few places throughout his speech but not very often. However, that is a prerogative in debates on appropriation bills, I suppose. It is important to note the disquiet throughout Australia with some of the policies that the government has implemented in the budget this year. Quite a few of my constituents in the electorate of Lyne on the mid-north coast of New South Wales are not very happy with the outcomes of the budget that was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The headline surplus of $718 million that has been achieved in this budget is seen by people as a real fudge of figures by the government. On page 7.3 of Budget Paper No. 1 we see that the underlying deficit is $8.2 billion. That is an ABS figure with the asset sales taken out. Although the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has claimed it as a great result that we have turned back into surplus after a number of years of producing deficit budgets, it is not really the case, because asset sales do nothing to boost national savings. When any other business sells a capital asset, a non-current asset, it does not bring it into the balance sheet the way the government has done in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real impact of this budget on individuals right across Australia will be in the increase of 8.9 per cent in taxes. The increase in company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent is a broken Keating promise announced during the campaign for the 1993 election. The increase in wholesale sales tax on cars from 16 to 21 per cent is another broken promise from the 1993 election. The 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on building materials will, depending on the construction of a home and what goes into it, increase the cost of a $100,000 home by $2,500. If you work that through, say, a 30-year mortgage on a home, it could impact on home buyers by about $6,000. That is not to be sneezed at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that, in a cynical way, that manoeuvre by the government could put pressure on the money market and interest rates in that it will certainly lessen the demand for finance in the housing sector. It will drive the housing sector even lower than at the moment. The number of housing approvals has really dropped off. I have got a number of letters from constituents in my electorate that attest to that. The number dropped off prior to the budget; it will certainly drop off more after the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent was never going to happen, said the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). An increased tax on bank licences and fees will raise another $822 million over four years. That money will ultimately end up coming out of the pockets of average taxpayers across Australia by way of bank charges and bank fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a reduction in outlays&mdash;which a lot of people do not read about in the newspaper reports on the budget&mdash;such as reform of indexation for Commonwealth own purpose outlays. The Treasurer today in question time was just dropping the Royal Flying Doctor Service into that category. A reduction in the government's own purpose outlays is just a reduction in funding to activities of government. That is where the flying doctor service got its budgetary cuts. An amount of $2 billion dollars is being picked up here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, a lot of specific purpose payments to the states are being cut and they are included in that $2 billion which is being saved. I have just been participating in an inquiry being conducted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. These are a means by which the government can cut outlays in the budget and let a lot of the state governments wear the blame for their programs being cut. It is a good sleight of hand trick that is evident right throughout this 1995-96 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government is reducing its own running costs by $662 million. There are also cuts to the Working Nation program of $1,216.5 million; that is, $1.2 billion in cuts to the Working Nation program. The previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt, was talking about the Working Nation programs when I came into the chamber. There was not a great deal of fuss made about that $1.2 billion cut. The minister was able to deal with it quite well because so far this year I think the program has been pretty well underspent. That provided a bit of saving in itself. I would imagine that is factored into the $1.2 billion that is being saved in those Working Nation programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I say, the greatest fudge in this budget is the asset sales. Over the last five years or so, this government has factored asset sales worth $8.075 billion into its budgets. It has put in budgets that it is going to sell $8 billion worth of assets, but to date it has achieved only $3.7 billion worth of asset sales. It will be interesting to see what the result of this year's asset sales will be at the end of this next 12 months. Will we ever see the finalisation of the sale of the FAC, of Qantas and of ANL? There seem to be ever decreasing chances of ANL actually getting sold, with the intervention of the unions at this stage. In every year from 1990 onwards, the government has budgeted on $8 billion worth of asset sales, but to date it has achieved only $3.7 billion worth to prop up its spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year again factored into the budget is the sale of the holy cow, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Will that be achieved? Will some of the queries that have been raised by the opposition about the legitimacy of that decision allow the government to proceed through that program?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of company directors right across Australia are complaining about the integrity of the Treasurer of the government of Australia making a statement on a prospectus and then doubling back on it a few years later. If any company directors did that the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;or whatever Commonwealth body oversees those people and their activities&mdash;would be down on them like a ton of bricks. It will be interesting to watch the progress of that particular element of asset sales in the budget this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises that great issue of what is good for the goose should be good for the gander. If we are going to be enforcing some fairly stringent rules about the duties of company directors, why should the Treasurer of Australia not be put in the same category? Why should he not be accountable in exactly the same way? It will be interesting to see the outcome of that asset sale. I found this interesting quote when doing a bit of research for this speech tonight. I realise that this is going back a fair way, but in 1985 the current Prime Minister, then Treasurer, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Telecom, Australia Post and the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the hands of the Commonwealth . . . We are not about wrecking them and selling them.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Prime Minister of Australia. The sale of the Commonwealth Bank was factored into the equation at the eleventh hour, as the documents were being rushed off to the printers, to facilitate bringing that budget down with a surplus of $718 million to try to appease the markets, to try to fudge it and to try to paint a glossy picture in the hope that we see another drop in interest rates. That certainly remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other budget fiddles on top of asset sales include the one-off repayment of Commonwealth advances by Queensland of $994 million; the reconfiguration of Telstra equity injections worth $250 million; capital repayment by Australia Post, the Commonwealth being the only shareholder, of $75 million; increased dividends from government business enterprises, again the Commonwealth is the single shareholder, of $107 million. It will be interesting to see how this is going to be achieved. In a previous inquiry we had an interesting debate on whether the minister responsible for the portfolio that controls policy settings of government business enterprises should also be the shareholder where there is a conflict of interest between those policy settings and the economic imperatives of squeezing more dividend, more profit, out of those government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the sale of the entire Dasfleet. It has come to light this week in the budget papers that that particular decision was also rushed in, along with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The budget papers say that the government is going to sell Dasfleet for an estimated $400 million and in this next financial year is still going to get the profit from the operation of the fleet. It is going to be interesting to see how it is going to achieve that. It will be one to watch to see what the downstream effects of that will be in the next 12 months. That is another fudged factor in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in this parliament since the 1993 election. The Prime Minister's favourite saying when attacking the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the opposition generally, after spewing out a whole heap of statistics which nobody understands, is: `Mr Speaker, this makes a lie of what the opposition leader has been saying. These statistics today make a lie of what the opposition policies are.' This budget confirms as lies all the Prime Minister's promises at the last election and prior to the last election. In November 1992 the great promise of the Prime Minister was: `What I am promising is not to put up tax.' All we have seen since the 1993 election is massive increases in the taxation burden on the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the February 1993 campaign, he said, `They'&mdash;the tax cuts&mdash;`are not a promise; they are l-a-w.' They have gone by the by, haven't they? They have gone ta-ta and they are not to be seen. They will not be seen by some people&mdash;another sleight of hand trick in this you-beaut, fantastic national savings program that does not start until 1997. That shows the importance that has been placed by this government on improving our national savings. That scheme does not start until 1997, after the next election. How cynical is this government? In 1985, as I said, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the hands of the Commonwealth . . . We are not about wrecking them and selling them.</PARA>
<PARA>The most heartless, most unrealistic, out of touch and arrogant comment of all came from the Prime Minister at the end of budget week when he was taking incoming phone calls on talkback radio in Brisbane. He said about small business:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if they are feeling the pinch, they ought to say "small business is not for me", because it is never going to get any better. This is as good as it ever gets . . . they have got to say "I had better go back to PAYE employment".</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Prime Minister of Australia talking about 870,000 Australian small business operators who are the engine room of this country and who provide the majority of the employment in this country. If he had any nous at all, he would realise that they are the 870,000 people who will provide long-term employment in the future in this country if given a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget forecasts are very interesting. The 1995-96 current account deficit forecast is $27 billion. What is it today? It is $27 billion dollars. So the government is admitting that it is not going to do anything about the current account deficit during the next 12 months. It says four per cent inflation and 8.25 per cent unemployment, which is what it is today. The government is saying that it is not going to do anything about unemployment for the next 12 months. Public debt interest is $9.38 billion. </PARA>

Australians are becoming desensitised to these outrageous figures. We are slipping further and further into the mire and our chance is just thrown away.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I close my remarks I will quote a few of the ordinary Australian small business people I was talking about earlier that the Prime Minister continually denigrates in this place. These people are kitchen manufacturers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to speak in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I hope the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) recovers from obviously a very sore throat. This has been a bold, bright and beautiful budget, no matter what the opposition says. We are going to have the typically feral response from the opposition because it cannot bear a good news story when it hears one. I am going to address a number of my remarks to the superannuation issue. But before I do I remind the House that the Treasurer (Mr Willis), in his speech to the House on budget night, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget that I deliver tonight has one principal objective: to provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will enable the continuation of substantial employment growth, falling unemployment and rising living standards, while reducing pressure on interest rates, inflation and the current account.</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the day what will help families, business and the future of this country is managing those issues. I heard the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) say earlier that this budget had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stamped all over it, or words to that effect. We should not be surprised by that. This government is about leading from the front with vision. We expect the Prime Minister, together with the Treasurer and all the senior ministers involved in the lengthy deliberations on the budget&mdash;it was a very tough process, and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, was involved in that process&mdash;to lead on this issue, as he does on all others. I will come back to the issue of leadership somewhat later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to specify some of the issues that were certainly of importance in my electorate of Capricornia, which is in Central Queensland and a regional and rural type of electorate. Certainly one of the key issues for me was Queensland's huge win in university places from the budget&mdash;4,200 growth places over the next three years. This will mean that Queensland's need to reach the national average will be met by the year 2001, with $2.2 billion for student places in 1996 to 1998, including $129.6 million for new student places. I am delighted to say that the Central Queensland University, which is based in Rockhampton but covers the Central Queensland region, is a beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As always, we tend to get people saying, `But it wasn't good enough. We need more. We still should have more.' Certainly that response was present. Some of the local press comments from key spokespersons for various industries interested me. There was the typical expected sort of whingeing, but organisations across the board and people who have given some thought to the matter after having had a chance to assess how the budget will impact on them are now saying it is indeed a very constructive budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about development in the university sector, we are really talking about infrastructure. Apart from providing education, which is vital for our young people at the tertiary level, we are also investing in state-of-the-art technology to provide those resources. We did not introduce up-front fees. Irrespective of what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said or what the Prime Minister said, students complained about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As should be said many times, when we first came to power in 1983 three out of 10 students finished high school in this country. Now the figure is closer to nine out of 10. In fact, young people between the ages of 15 and 18, and even beyond, will now be in training. We have expanded our TAFE sector enormously. These are real benefits to the families and young people concerned and to the future of this country. We cannot have a clever country if we do not have a trained work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social security measures, which the minister at the table was responsible for, have been warmly welcomed. They include increases in rent assistance for families. A particularly positive aspect is the streamlining of means testing for pensioner shares and managed investments. This has been a matter of considerable controversy during the life of this government. What we did in this matter was consult with people and listen to those consultations, as we have done with many other matters, and bring in a much more streamlined process so that there will be a much more transparent and easy way for aged pensioners to handle investments in shares and they will know exactly what they can expect from the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our new initiatives for families include a maternity allowance of at least $816, which I believe is a very positive move in dealing with providing benefits to families at a time of great expense&mdash;when new babies arrive. This allowance has been available to only a small portion of the work force up to now. I look forward to that measure being expanded when budgets will allow it. This measure will cost us $643 million over the next four years&mdash;a not inconsiderable amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of child care, the government has continued to forge ahead in the provision of work related child care. In this budget we will improve access for 31,000 families. As well, there will be more family day care places and more flexible services piloted in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had to represent the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) at a child-care centre seminar at the Gold Coast just after the budget week. Of course, there was a hue and cry once again. It came from a vested interest group that was frightening families and mothers about the supposed loss of child-care rebates for non-working parents. What we have effectively done is stop the rorts that were going on. We extended fee relief on a means tested basis to private child-care centres. Indeed, we have promoted the private child-care sector as the most effective way of making sure that we have work related child care to respond to a need. As I have said before, women are voting with their feet and they are in the work force because they want to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was happening in this area was that non-working parents who were accessing some hours of child care were being told by some centres, `You should register for 50 hours a week because that is as much fee relief as you can get.' In most cases those parents were using far from that amount and then some child-care centres were selling those places again and getting another lot of fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not about to subsidise small business to that extent. What we have done is provide for non-work related child care to be available by fee relief for 12 hours a week. My suggestion to those who are waxing strong on this issue is that they as an industry should talk to us and negotiate. This measure is not coming in for another 12 months, but we are not prepared in a tight fiscal position to subsidise small business in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are always being asked by the opposition to cut government spending. The opposition spokesperson was there on the day. He put in a pretty expected political performance by saying, `Isn't it shocking the way you people are being treated?' But he forgot to say that that was not one of the issues that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said in his response to the budget that he was going to block in the Senate. More of that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to other initiatives, particularly in the health area. They include: $18 million over three years to discourage young people from smoking&mdash;this is particularly important for young women&mdash;$25 million over two years on the national child immunisation program; $42 million over four years for cervical cancer screening programs; $13 million over four years to develop and trial strategies to reduce youth suicide; and $204 million over four years to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. We will get all this from a 0.1 per cent rise in the Medicare levy&mdash;about 64c a week, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is $217 million being given over the next four years for environmental issues, including the coastal management package and the acceleration of the national forest policy arrangements, biodiversity and wetlands programs. We would always like to do more, but once again we have interest groups saying, `You should have done more.' In relation to the drought relief measures, which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has just extended today to take in drought areas in New South Wales and Victoria, the public response in my electorate was, `There is nothing in the budget for us; nothing in the budget for rural producers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found that absolutely stunning when, in fact, our drought relief package, delivered in September and December 1994, gave over $500 million to drought assistance through the drought relief payment which has now been picked up by over 10,000 families. With the current extension, which is worth another $40 million or so, there will be a sizeable increase in the number of families&mdash;another 4,000 families&mdash;who qualify for the exceptional circumstances payments. Apart from the drought relief payment, we have also removed the assets tests for Austudy, and there are additional family payments and health care benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a remarkable response to a very serious problem. In my own electorate, we still have major problems with the drought. In the long-term planning measures, which came through the parliament in December, we have dealt with the farm management bond scheme and investment allowance issues&mdash;a whole raft of measures worth millions of dollars for our hard hit rural producers. So it is a bit stunning when rural spokespeople say, `There is nothing in it for us.' The new body in Queensland handling the rural adjustment scheme is encouraging people to reassess their eligibility for rural adjustment because there is money available to help farm families. We want to keep efficient primary producers on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue in my electorate is the benefits to the coal industry&mdash;$9.2 million to promote coal exports and $2.8 million to encourage best practice and productivity initiatives in the industry. All of these have come out of very important consultations with the ACTU. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I are on the caucus committee dealing with that. I am delighted to say that representatives of the Queensland coal industry came to see me for the first time today to discuss the issue. As I have more coalmines in my electorate than any other member in the federal parliament, I was delighted that two years down the track the coal owners thought it was time they actually spoke to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key issues of this budget is the big win for everyone&mdash;superannuation. What have we heard from the opposition? We have heard that there is terrible fraud on tax cuts not being delivered. But let me tell the House what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> said in its response in an article titled `Big gain in 3pc pain':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the plan announced in this week's Budget, a worker on average weekly earnings will be more than $100 a week better off in superannuation at retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in return for losing out on a $9.20 a week tax cut promised in the Government's 1992 One Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Canberra will match the compulsory super contributions made by low and middle-income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dollar-for-dollar deal will be means tested and will not apply to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>But it will apply to income earners earning up to $46,000 a year. That is a pretty generous and non-regressive tax cut. In fact, while there are undoubtedly people in this country who would like to get their $9 a week now&mdash;and I understand that&mdash;what we have had to do, and what only a Labor government would do, is take the hard decision on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chifley government wanted to bring in a retirement benefit. But that was all too hard for the Menzies government. It could not plan a retirement incomes policy. We never saw a retirement incomes policy from the present Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer or from the Fraser government. Despite what the Whitlam government tried to do, it took this government, fighting tooth and nail every step of the way, to get a compulsory superannuation scheme going so that high income earners and long-time public servants would not be the only people to benefit from a superannuation scheme, which because of tax incentives always gave further tax benefits to high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government realised that, given that we have an ageing population and that working people will probably spend 20 to 30 years in retirement with better health and will want to do more and have a better standard of living, we had to help them now and, at the same time, increase our deplorable record in national savings&mdash;all the things I would have thought the opposition would have applauded. But no, it does not want to do that; that is all too difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just get the figures right. Single persons on average wages who have been in the work force since their thirties could have expected pre-budget to have received $264,427 in superannuation. In future, they can expect to receive nearly $462,000. Pre-budget, a couple on average wages could have expected to have received around $455,000. In future, they can expect to receive a vastly increased amount&mdash;$797,000. The measure will also assist women who are working part time. In delivering the budget, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a couple on average earnings, now in their mid-30s, the Government's initiatives deliver retirement incomes 75 per cent higher than the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a very positive commitment to provide those tax cuts. We brought the first part forward in the 1993 budget. Now we are delivering in a way that will materially assist families when they most need it&mdash;at retirement&mdash;while at the same time providing a vastly increased pool of savings. It will benefit workers right up to the higher income earners. I believe what we have done on superannuation is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing we have done is to provide information to people. One of the concerns in the community has been the many changes to the superannuation scheme. They have occurred because we have been trying to make it better and more effective all the time. This is particularly true of the collection mechanisms for small fund and part-time workers. But it is very important to know that, if people have concerns, the Taxation Office has actually put in place an information hotline that people can access. If people ring 13 10 20, they will get their information. There are a number of other hotlines that people can ring to get the information they require. I believe that once people are aware of the benefits they will indeed be very positive and the positive poll results on this issue will be further entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comparison, what is the opposition delivering? I thought I would be underwhelmed by the response from the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;I said that in the House on the day he delivered his response&mdash;but I was appalled by his response. The Leader of the Opposition said that the opposition would oppose various tax cuts, the rise in company tax and so on. But several days later the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello)&mdash;that slick salesperson with no substance, little style but a bit of slickness, as Michael Gordon suggested in his article&mdash;said, `No. We will oppose them, but if they get through we will not change that.' What sort of hypocrisy is that? I notice that Tom Burton in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 26 May wrote an article headed `Will the real John Howard stand up'. The opposition does not have any policies and does not have any leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, this budget is a piece which contains all our policies. It is integrated, forward looking and will deliver real assistance for families. It will enable an increase in the number of jobs. This five minutes of economic sunshine that the Leader of the Opposition talks about, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said, is nonsense when this government has been producing employment growth that those opposite said could never happen and projected could never be achieved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has changed for my electorate after five years and six ALP budgets? Not much. The problems I spoke about which I could not understand, and which my electors could not understand, was why the government would increase interest rates for small business, why people with mortgages had to pay $300 or $400 more per month, and why wives had to return unwillingly to work to pay that mortgage on the pretext that this would solve our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had too many imports flowing into this country.

The next year, 1993, the Labor Party was re-elected by using the slogan `jobs not GST'. We all heard it. It was plastered up across this nation.

After using the theme of jobs not GST, and having no mandate to increase taxes, Treasurer Dawkins introduced the high tax budget. What did Treasurer Dawkins say about indirect taxes?

They say this at a time when small businesses are going broke. When a business goes broke people are put out of work and bills are not paid. In my area, the building industry is suffering and the subcontractors are bearing the brunt of the problem. They cannot absorb the costs into their overheads so they have to pass them on to consumers. We all pay a higher price. The case is not that small business has never had it so good, the case is that small business is made up of desperate Australians living on a knife edge. </PARA>

Two days before the budget was delivered the Prime Minister decided in his office that he would have a manufactured surplus. The decision was taken at the last moment to sell the Commonwealth Bank and other major assets. Other members have raised the issue of the sale of Dasfleet. That was a fraudulent exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. What I think is funny is the speeches I hear from people who condemn everything out of hand but have not got a clue what they would do themselves. The other big thing about this budget is that speakers on the appropriation bills do not have to be relevant, which is just as well because it is very hard to be relevant about a budget that has already been brought down. But I must say that the tedious drivel that one hears comes from both sides. We worship the chivalrous, we talk about small business without actually understanding or knowing what small business is or what the real problems are. I suggest to this House that the great problem today is that we have far too much bipartisanship in this place. There is really not a great deal of difference between the rabble on that side and what the government proposes and what the government is doing. Sadly, neither, in my view, has the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told how important tourism is, that tourism is the solution. I can remember that not so many years ago tourism was going to be the answer to our problems. The truth about tourism is this: no-one can tell you what the net figure for tourism is, but it is one hell of a lot less than the gross figure. That is also true for elaborately transformed manufactured goods. We on this side say, `We have increased it, as a percentage of revenue, to 30 per cent from a very low base.' That sounds significant and it is. But, once again, it is a gross figure, not a net figure. No-one really knows what the net figure is. Once again, like tourism, it is considerably less than the gross figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit is a great problem confronting Australia. I hear some people on this side say, `It doesn't matter because the current account deficit is not government debt; it is private sector debt.' The effect on the economy is exactly the same; it does not matter. The current account deficit is a problem and it must be brought under control. The problem is that once we get above four per cent growth in the economy we suck up imports because we do not manufacture anything any more. If you have more than four per cent growth, the current account is going to blow out. That has to be addressed by a coherent industry policy. I see no signs of industry policy on either side of this House. In fact, the position of the opposition, as it goes to a supposed level playing field with zero tariffs, will compound the errors that we are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other things in the budget that need to be mentioned in passing. The government is expressing its concern about Aboriginal health, and it will demonstrate this by spending $102 million on Aboriginal health over two years. We are also putting $46 million into housing over two years to improve Aboriginal housing. The reality is this: if you really want to improve Aboriginal health&mdash;and I am not sure that is the end desire&mdash;what you would do is put the $102 million into housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By improving the level of housing you would automatically improve the level of health. That is not what we will do. We will go on funding Aboriginal medical services, which is basically an expensive way of providing an inferior service. The evidence to demonstrate that is overwhelming, but we will keep on doing it because it is politically correct to do so. The reality is that the opposition will do just the same because it is afflicted with the same sort of political correctness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of assets has been mentioned. It is true that many people believe that the sale of assets is an easy option and if it does not work then you sell them again. Unfortunately, you cannot do that. You lose the income stream of those assets when they are sold. I have no great view about government ownership of many things, but there are some things I believe should be under government control, and I would go to the barricades for some of those things. I would argue, for instance, that the big advances in telecommunications have been brought about not by competition, as we are told by both sides of parliament, but by technological advancement. I believe that Telecom was one of the great unifying factors in society, providing services equally across the community. It is going to be forced to abandon that scheme or dilute it due to economic pressures imposed upon it. This should be remembered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale and lease-back of Commonwealth cars, I must say, is stupid. It will undoubtedly cost more in the long run than the present system. There is absolutely no doubt about that. If we do that for cosmetic reasons, it is basically silly. I might just say while I am on the subject that Commonwealth cars are, in my view, exceptional value. It is not readily recognised by either sides of this House that they provide a very good service&mdash;a service that the government will have to provide at some level. You simply cannot put visiting heads of state into taxis. It is a service that, I believe, is worth the money it costs. When people talk about losses, they are talking about book entries, shuffling from one department to the other. I think the time is overdue for us to take a serious look at a real cost benefit analysis of the Commonwealth car service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to superannuation, it is quite clear that we need to increase saving in this country, but I am not sure myself that I trust the superannuation companies. They are mainly incompetent, and the returns they have had in recent years have been negative in many cases. I know of cases where people are actually losing their capital because of the very high charges imposed by incompetent funds. I also have grave concern that sooner or later we are going to see one of these superannuation companies fall over, go broke. I believe that the government will then be in a dilemma of having an absolute moral obligation, if not a legal obligation, to bale that fund out. The government has forced people to put their money into these companies and, therefore, I believe the government's moral obligation would be absolute. That is something that has to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that the British have done it somewhat better with their funded pension scheme. The funded pension scheme in Britain&mdash;and remember that Margaret Thatcher never touched the British funded pension scheme; she never attempted to dismantle it or privatise it in any way&mdash;collects money from people through the taxation system, puts it into the funded pension scheme and provides a safety net. People wanting more than that can arrange their own superannuation. I think that is a better option. It is interesting, too, that the British pension scheme is the largest investor in new British technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That cannot be said for superannuation companies in this country. They spend very little, infinitesimal amounts, in research or in the development of new technology. They simply will not take those risks. It is a risky area, but it has to be realised that success in those areas is very profitable. You do not have to pick that winner every time. I believe that we will have to look at a situation where, if the superannuation companies do not lift their game in respect of investing in new Australian technology, we will have to force them to do that. I say that with great regret because I do not believe, generally, in that line of action, but I think their performance to date has been so abysmal that we are going to have to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that industry policy is the key. I think we have to decide what an industry policy is. An industry policy, in my view, is the arrangement of circumstances to provide the best opportunity for chosen industries to develop, thrive and to continue. It is not just directions from manufacturing in isolation. It has to be integrated with influences as diverse as industrial relations, immigration policy, social welfare policy, taxation, environmental policy, research and development policy, foreign aid, government purchasing policy, and, above all, the government's attitude to its own people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The number of reports over the years on the problems of Sydney's urban sprawl would no doubt fill the Opera House. It would, therefore, be naive to think that any great breakthrough will emerge from New South Wales Premier Carr's latest call for an examination of the problem. Nevertheless, there are some grounds for optimism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carr is certainly the first major figure in state or federal governments to dare to raise the fundamental cause of urban sprawl&mdash;population growth and, therefore, immigration. It is true that there are many other causes of sprawl and that even with no immigration the population would still grow slightly for a few years; nevertheless, immigration is the dominant cause, all things being equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we continue with current policies, we can expect a Sydney population of over 4.5 million in 25 years. That means at least 500,000 new dwellings and space for many thousands of workplaces, shops, community facilities, roads and all the services required by the increased population. It means a further deterioration in the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the present state of the Sydney basin&mdash;with such problems as the ocean beaches contaminated with raw sewage, contamination of the Hawkesbury-Nepean waterway, the problems of air quality, waste disposal, endless traffic congestion and the failure of successive state government urban consolidation policies&mdash;Premier Carr is certainly correct in raising this issue. We are now paying the penalty for the last 50 years of running the developed world's highest rate of immigration while simultaneously reducing urban infrastructure spending in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immigration policy, since it lost public support in the 1960s, has been driven by special interest. Migration numbers have never been determined by considering the effect on infrastructure, health, education, urban sprawl or, in fact, almost anything except political advantage. It has been a cat and mouse game balancing ethnic demands and public opinion and maintaining a bipartisan position depriving the public of any say. Total immigration figures have, therefore, wildly fluctuated from year to year, rather than having established a long-term, considered, sustainable target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hysterical reaction to Carr's initiative from `the usual suspects' underlines the difficulty of sensibly addressing immigration numbers. Ethnic leaders will continue to generate community distrust and undermine their own credibility while ever they continue to react to any suggestion of questioning immigration levels as a `racist attack on migrants', ignoring all other effects of population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State Liberal MP Helen Sham-Ho went right over the top in accusing Carr of racial vilification and promoting hatred on the basis of ethnic origins. Coming from a leading spokesperson for ethnic communities, this shows what can happen under racial vilification legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a rational statement on immigration and urban sprawl, whatever its merits, one could be impoverished after having been dragged through a futile court action. No reasonable person faced with the prospect of being financially broken will be prepared to even enter into public discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is irrelevant that the racial vilification accusations made by Sham-Ho are ridiculous and only show her obsessive and myopic view of the world. The fact that Sham-Ho's views are shared by a large number of racial McCarthyists heading many publicly funded organisations determined to find racists under every bed now makes discussion of population growth extremely dangerous. It confirms that freedom of speech is massively limited by racial vilification legislation and the threat of expensive legal action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Carr has had no choice but to raise the question of sustainable population growth, given the federal government's abysmal record of ignoring the problems. The reaction of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) of pandering to ethnic fears in an attempt to curry political favour, and the irrelevant mantra from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who equated urban sprawl with residential density claiming in effect that population growth is not a factor, leaves any dispassionate observer in despair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urban sprawl in Sydney and most of Australia's urban areas is a result of four major factors: firstly, the conscious and unconscious policy decisions of state and federal governments over the last 50 years to encourage and subsidise road based transport; secondly, the lack of any land use transport plan and even any mechanism to implement such a plan if it existed; thirdly, ignoring the effect of the expansion of non-residential land uses, which makes up about 70 per cent of urban areas in Australia; and, fourthly, the rate of population growth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited Kowanyama, and it is good to see the things that are happening in the justice system in that community. Under an initiative of the Queensland government, they already have local JPs who have been trained.

That is a very good scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Kowanyama, we also heard about the proposal to have a community accounting conferencing scheme. This is a system where every person in the community who has been affected by a crime has an opportunity to participate in community dialogue, resulting in an offender being able to see the full impact of how his or her crime affected each person. That is very important because there are problems&mdash;especially with youth crime&mdash;in communities like Kowanyama. This proposal has been welcomed by the Kowanyama community council in response to a joint proposal put forward by policeman Bill Hiscocks and the school principal, Barbara Loban. I certainly commend the Kowanyama community for this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also positive to see the women of Pormpuraaw at the women's centre who were taking the lead in their community.

It was good to see the initiatives taken by the Napranum council, both in doing work for the Weipa community and in the completion of the fencing contract for the Scherger air base. It was great&mdash;and I know the minister will agree with me on this&mdash;to go to Mossman Gorge to see that community's plans for development in the tourism industry in a very beautiful part of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, things like roads and health were raised. These matters are perennial problems in the peninsula and cannot be ignored.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I would also like to talk about an important mining town which has been in the news lately for more than its mining. I visited Weipa with Minister Tickner. The media has fixed on Weipa as an example of bank greed. Bank bashing has become a national sport in Australia. Some of the people's criticisms of banks are excessive, but not in this case. Nowhere has there been a greater example of a bank failing in its service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank decided to close its Weipa branch in November last year. There was no consultation or notification and residents of Weipa were suddenly faced with the prospect of going from having full banking services to having few options. No-one had any idea that the bank would be closing its branch. When the Commonwealth Bank made the decision, people found out with only two weeks notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, Weipa residents were not happy about the closure and protested strongly. People such as Anna Clark put in a great deal of work to impress upon the bank the stupidity of its decision. I have contacted the bank on several occasions. The bank was so arrogant that it did not even reply to my letters. The Commonwealth Bank's short-term financial decision must result in long-term losses as the goodwill and customer loyalty of people in Weipa disintegrates. </PARA>

I cannot understand it, and neither can the farming families in my area. Why is the government pouring billions of dollars into job creation programs when some well placed assistance in the farm sector would do more to put people back into employment than would any number of short-term programs? Here was an opportunity for the government to provide these farming communities with financial assistance and income support to get them through the next nine months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australia Remembers 1945-1995 commemorative campaign has been an outstanding success. It has received a tremendous response right throughout Australia, and my electorate has been no exception to that. I would like to take a few minutes to speak briefly about the commemorative services that were held to mark VE Day on 7 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank a few people for their assistance in making the ceremony in Ipswich such a success. I refer in particular to Group Captain Phil Presgrave and Warrant Officer David Basham of the RAAF base at Amberley. The air force base has naturally been very supportive of this program, and I would like to put on record my deep appreciation of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our memorial service and wreath laying ceremony, which was held on Sunday, 7 May to remember VE Day, was a very successful day as a result of the support that we had from the RAAF base at Amberley. Our guest speaker, retired Air Commodore Deryck Kingwell, was a former commanding officer of the RAAF base at Amberley. I would like to say a few things about retired Air Commodore Kingwell tonight. Everyone who attended the ceremony was moved by his speech and his reminiscence of the war in which he served with distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deryck Kingwell was born in Brisbane on 15 June 1916. His association with flying began early with his great interest and involvement in the Annerley Gliding Club, which flew at the open fields at the Yeronga-Fairfield bend of the Brisbane River. In 1935 he applied to join the RAAF and was inducted into Point Cook in July 1936 as an air cadet. At that time, the Royal Australian Air Force consisted of 138 officers, 61 cadets and 1,166 airmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deryck Kingwell's induction into the RAAF was the start of an auspicious service career, spanning some 35 years. It began in the right vein, with him winning both the Sword of Honour upon graduation as the top cadet and the Mannock Cup for best pilot on the course. After a short posting to No. 3 Squadron at Richmond and some time in Britain on training, he returned to Point Cook for training as an instructor in mid-1938. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When war was declared, the expansion of the RAAF became the major priority in his life. At the age of just 23, he became the chief instructor at the General Reconnaissance School at Point Cook. He established and ran the first wartime specialist navigation course in the RAAF. Some 18 months later, at what by today's standards was the remarkably young age of just 24, he became Squadron Leader Kingwell and took command of the school at Point Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later he took command of No. 23 Squadron at Archerfield. In 1942 the Squadron's Hudsons were posted to Port Moresby and linked up with Hudsons from No. 6 Squadron and No. 24 Squadron to form the new No. 32 Squadron under the command of Deryck Kingwell. His job was to stem what at the time seemed to be the inevitable Japanese tide of conquest in the Pacific. He had to do this with a total of just 10 Hudsons and a handful of Catalina flying boats at his command. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time will not allow me to cover everything, but there were some tremendous stories told about Air Commodore Kingwell in his war history, particularly in Papua New Guinea. At one stage he was attacked by some Japanese Zeros. Of course, the Hudsons were a reasonably slow aircraft against Japanese Zero fighters. So they used to often hide in the cloud as part of their manoeuvres. During this particular conflict, it just happened to be a fine day. They went through all the manoeuvres and the Zeros were actually defeated on this occasion, which was a good thing. The Hudson was damaged and crew were wounded, but they got back to base safely&mdash;no doubt as a result of Air Commodore Kingwell's experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war, the now retired Air Commodore Kingwell filled many posts in the RAAF, both in Australia and overseas. He was instrumental in recommending the purchase of the Macchi aircraft in which so many RAAF pilots have done their jet training. He held the position of officer commanding Amberley air force base twice&mdash;first from 1954 to 1956 and again from 1967 to 1971&mdash;as Air Commodore Kingwell. Before his retirement in 1971 he was responsible for, amongst other things, replacing 82 Wing's Lincoln bombers with Canberras, which were in turn replaced with Phantoms. Unfortunately, Air Commodore Kingwell retired before the F111 was introduced to Amberley. Of course, he would have loved to have been part of that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on record my appreciation to all the RAAF people at Amberley of their assistance and, in particular, to retired Air Commodore Kingwell for his participation in the VE Day commemorative service in Ipswich.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Hinkler)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.48 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to pay tribute to the Troiani family of Bundaberg in my electorate of Hinkler on a truly remarkable achievement in building products technology. This family owns and operates Australia's largest privately owned brick manufacturer&mdash;Wide Bay Bricks&mdash;on the Bundaberg industrial estate. Last Wednesday saw a major milestone in this highly successful regionally based family company which now sells bricks not only to an extensive domestic market but to the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week Wide Bay Bricks unveiled the latest and biggest upgrade&mdash;the largest and most advanced roller kiln not in Australia but in the world. It is a tribute to provincial companies to think that, with all the demand for building products in an expanding nation like Australia, what was once a relatively small brickworks in a provincial town could now have the largest roller kiln technology not only in Australia but in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The roller kiln, costing $14 million, incorporates the latest in clay brick manufacturing technology and will boost the company's total production capacity to around 90 million bricks a year. The high-tech mori roller kiln will further enhance the company's strong reputation for quality brick products and customer service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of Wide Bay's success can be attributed to the company's founder, Mr Sante Troiani; the Troiani family partners, his brothers and sisters; and the Luff family of the Sunshine Coast. Success did not come easily for Sante Troiani. He was a young man when he came out to Australia in the postwar period. He worked as a cane cutter, and got a little farm. He brought out his brother, his sister came and worked for the two boys, and they built up a very successful cane farm. They became highly expert orchardists in the fields of mangoes and avocados and, later as floriculturalists, their carnations became famous throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a chance investment and a love of ceramics from his native part of Italy on the east coast that saw Sante Troiani purchase the run-down Bundaberg brickworks in 1974&mdash;purely as an investment; he never saw himself as a brickmaker. But, as I said, his love of ceramics and the fact he had this brickworks that only turned out 4 1/2 million bricks enticed him to do something with it. In 1976&mdash;and I remember this day well as I was there&mdash;the then Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, opened Sante Troiani's plant on Bundaberg's industrial estate. By 1986, just 10 years later, he had introduced one of the first tunnel kilns to Australia at a cost of $5 million, lifting the brickwork's capacity from about four million bricks to 48 million bricks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a struggle, too. It did not come easily. I remember he had terrific problems in adapting European technology to the Australian conditions, Australian clays and Australian gases. During this time he developed a whole range of products&mdash;patented reinforced products&mdash;and he was probably the first to develop the clay block, as distinct from the brick, which became the rival for the concrete block and has become very important in designing buildings against earthquakes, cyclones, and that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the company started exporting bricks to New Zealand&mdash;and that is quite an achievement; you would hardly think it would be profitable to ship bricks across the Tasman. But not to be outdone in that enterprise, in December 1990 he then started to export to Japan. He now exports 15 per cent of his production to the Asia-Pacific region. This roller kiln of course, with its capacity of 90 million bricks, will put him into yet another league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I would like to pay tribute to this family. I was present on Wednesday when the state Minister for Industry, Business and Regional Development, Warren Pitt, opened the brickworks. I was able to join with 200 of Mr Sante Troiani's business associates, builders and friends in paying him tribute and recording his success and the contribution he has made to the community. It has not just been one of creating jobs and creating clay products. He has put a lot back into the community; he has been a great agriculturalist. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the 1993 election the government made a commitment to the Australian people that it would engineer strong economic growth and job growth in Australia&mdash;and it has done that. At that time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a commitment to the Australian people and to the unemployed of this country not to leave them behind in the economic recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government responded to the unemployment situation in 1994 with the Working Nation program, the most ambitious and comprehensive economic and social program announced by any government in our postwar history. The government committed billions of dollars worth of Commonwealth resources and called on communities to enter into a partnership with the Commonwealth to confront the unemployment problems in their own areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Geelong community responded admirably to this challenge and formed a local task force to initiate a jobs action campaign, which it entitled `We're all in it'. That program was initiated by the city of Greater Geelong in cooperation with a radio station, Bay FM, the CES, the community of Geelong, employers, the trade union movement, community groups&mdash;and, of course, I give a special mention to the Rotary clubs of Geelong who swung in strongly behind that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign was announced by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on 21 July 1994. It had a fairly ambitious target of creating 1,000 vacancies in a 12-month period. The federal government allocated an amount of $20,000 to that committee, and that was matched by the city of Greater Geelong with a commitment of $20,000 as well. The results are fairly impressive. About 1,240 persons who had been registered with the CES for in excess of 12 months were placed in employment; 405 new employers became users of the government's labour market programs; and, over that 12-month period, 3,650 vacancies were lodged with the CES&mdash;an increase of 418 over the previous year or 12-month period. In addition to those activities, the committee organised an industrial relations seminar, which was very successful, and also promoted vigorously the national training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the committee and the task force and, in particular, Trevor Cole, Chairman of the Rotary Service Clubs, who did much to rally the Rotary clubs of Geelong in this endeavour; he had a passion for this particular campaign, and its success is owed very much to his efforts. I also pay tribute to Glyn Jenkins, Deputy Chairman of City of Greater Geelong Commissioners; he came to me in the early stages and asked whether the Commonwealth would commit its resources to this campaign which he worked tirelessly to support. Tony Stante of the CES, Geelong region, also did a power of work in a secretarial and administrative support role to that committee and put in a lot of leg work; the success of the campaign is directly attributable to his efforts as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to Reg Fisher of the Greater City of Geelong; Jenny Stow, Regional Manager of CES, Geelong; Victor Hunt of the Geelong Trades Hall Council; David Peart of the City of Greater Geelong Development Unit; Cath Fraser of Sales-Marketing, Geelong Advertiser Group; Laurie Wanders from CES Employer Services; Steve Gartland from my office; and of course Graeme Bound, Regional Director, Brotherhood of St Laurence&mdash;all of whom formed the core committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former members who also contributed and supported that campaign were Gordon Bratby, formerly of Bay FM; Graeme Hawkins, Development Board, Greater City of Geelong; John Kranz, Secretary, Geelong Trades Hall; and Lisa Meyers, Regional Manager, CES, Geelong. Additional support came from Cathy Roth, Geelong Chamber of Commerce; Mike O'Brien, Australian Chamber of Manufactures; Graeme Esler, VECCI; Jim Harvey, Metal Trades Industry Association; David Rolfe, Geelong Region Group Training; and Graeme Goldsworthy, Geelong Otway Tourism Authority. It was a magnificent effort from that particular committee. I bring the efforts of the committee to the attention of the House and, through this adjournment debate, from the citizens of the Greater City of Geelong, thank the members for their magnificent effort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(3) The Australian Education Council (AEC) was a Council of Commonwealth and State Ministers with portfolio responsibility for education. The function of the Council was to promote the development of Australian education by enabling Ministers to consult on matters of common interest and generally to facilitate exchange of information and co-ordination of common programs. The Chair of the meeting rotated annually among members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC was merged with the Ministers of Vocational Education, Employment and Training (MOVEET) and the Youth Ministers' Council in December 1993 to form the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC was supported by a Standing Committee of representatives of the Ministers, usually with head of department status. The AEC also established working parties according to need. Most had representation from all States and the Commonwealth but occasionally the AEC resolved that particular tasks be undertaken by smaller groups. Some working parties were ongoing; others were set up to work on a specific short-term task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC operated on a consensus basis and proposals, initiated by the Commonwealth or the States, would often change over time in light of the AEC consultative processes. Issues and proposals cannot always be clearly identified as wholly Commonwealth initiatives. Therefore, all parts of the question are answered together by referring to major proposals which the Commonwealth sponsored through the collaborative processes of the AEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Collaborative Curriculum</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its policy to improve the quality of schooling the AEC agreed to promote a comprehensive national collaborative strategy. In 1989 the AEC ratified a set of common and agreed national goals for schooling in Australia. Following this agreement the Directors-General and Directors of Curriculum agreed in January 1991 that national curriculum statements should be prepared in the eight identified key learning areas. After a mapping of existing curricula was undertaken, the AEC commissioned the development of national statements and profiles in the learning areas of English, mathematics, arts, studies of society and environment, science, technology, health and physical education and languages other than English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draft statements and profiles for the eight learning areas were considered by the AEC in July 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its October 1991 meeting the AEC established an AEC/MOVEET Working Party to oversee national implementation of the ALLP.  The Working Party, now known as the MCEETYA Taskforce on the ALLP, has three subgroups: the Languages Other Than English (LOTE) in Schools Subgroup, the Adult LOTE and Asian Studies Subgroup and the Adult English Language and Literacy Subgroup.

The National Policy was reviewed in 1991. A major outcome from the review was the National Action Plan for the Education of Girls 1993-1997 (NAP) which was endorsed by the AEC in November 1992. Its eight priority areas form a framework for action and annual reporting. From 1994, the annual reporting on the NAP will be included as part of the Annual National Report on Schooling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. In March 1993 the Government extended fringe benefit entitlements to all pensioners. These benefits include hearing services from AHS and are provided through a combination of AHS hearing centres and over 100 private sector contractors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I met with representatives of the hearing services industry in August 1994. At that meeting matters relating to the arrangements for providing Commonwealth hearing concessions to pensioners were discussed openly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. For any government the principles of competition and the associated efficiency objectives must be reconciled with broader social objectives. A balance between these is nowhere more crucial than in the provision of special benefits for the purpose of social equity; in this case government funded hearing services to pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. The cost of purchasing and fitting hearing aids by AHS is approximately $300 below the schedule fee paid to private sector providers for monaural fitting under service contract arrangements. AHS costs for binaural fittings are some $500 below the contract schedule fee for the same service. The incidence of binaural fittings by AHS contractors is 53%. Thus the average (weighted) difference between AHS costs and the schedule of fees for AHS contractors is approximately $400 per client. AHS costs have been calculated on the basis of full-cost and accrual accounting principles by external consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) AHS contracts out to accredited audiologists and audiometrists adult clients (pensioners and Commonwealth Seniors) who are excess to the operational capacity of AHS. These clients are free to attend the accredited provider of their choice and are provided with a directory of contractors for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of services associated with hearing rehabilitation is broader than testing and are provided by a service industry in which there is varying levels of expertise and no registration standards. Differences in the levels of audiological and optometrical benefits provided by the Commonwealth and in the status of providers makes direct comparisons between AHS services and the testing of eyesight inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) AHS, as the statutory provider of Commonwealth hearing services to children and pensioners, does not, nor does it seek to, control the private market (i.e. all those over 21 years who are not pensioners, eligible veterans, Health Benefit or Commonwealth Seniors card holders). As detailed above, Commonwealth beneficiaries referred to AHS contractors are free to choose their own service provider. AHS contract arrangements with accredited private sector agents involve standards that ensure pensioners receive appropriate levels and quality of service. The use by AHS of private sector contractors is monitored continually against levels of demand for services and AHS's obligations to its 300,000 existing child and adult clients and for responsible fiscal management.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The 1994-95 Defence Budget is $9,637 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) RAAF officers do not sign any specific employment contract with the RAAF. All RAAF officers are initially appointed to be an officer in the RAAF for a specified period under Air Force Regulation 46(1). An officer appointed for a specified period of service may, on or before the expiration of that period, volunteer for a further period of service or for permanent appointment and the Chief of the Air Staff may extend the appointment for a further specified period or convert the appointment to a permanent appointment accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When officers undertake special training, or special duty, or a period of service outside Australia, they may incur a Return of Service Obligation. The principal intent of the Return of Service Obligation policy is to assure the continuing service of the member for such a period as will provide the Service with a productive return for the investment in the skills and knowledge acquired by the member as a result, for example, the Return of Service Obligation for basic pilot training is ten years.

Broadly, this is achieved by capability considerations determining the project scope; value-for-money considerations in the source selection process, which may trade-off non-essential characteristics in a range of criteria; progressive testing and evaluation by the contractor and Defence during the contract period and final acceptance into service testing.</PARA>
