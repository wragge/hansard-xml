<PARA>This bill responds to the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Ah Hin Teoh, handed down on 7 April 1995. It follows a joint statement by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) on 10 May 1995 on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision raises the issue of the role of international law in Australian law. It raises a fundamental question about our system of parliamentary law making in Australia: should it be bypassed to allow for treaties to have direct effect in Australian law or should, as the government believes, the role of changing Australian law to conform with treaty obligations remain with the democratically elected parliament of this country? Before outlining the aim of the bill, and the reasons behind its enactment, it is useful to give a short description of the facts of the Teoh case, and the reasoning in the judgment of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The facts of the case</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Teoh was a Malaysian citizen who came to Australia on 5 May 1988 and was granted a temporary entry permit. On 9 July 1988 he married an Australian citizen. At the time of the marriage Mrs Teoh had four children. Later, Mr and Mrs Teoh had three more children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1988 Mr Teoh applied for and was granted a further temporary entry permit which allowed him to remain in Australia until 5 February 1989. Before that permit had expired he applied for a permanent entry permit, otherwise known as a grant of resident status. In November 1990, when his application for resident status was still pending, Mr Teoh was convicted of six counts of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin and of three counts of being in possession of heroin. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and eight months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January 1991, Mr Teoh was informed that his application for permanent resident status had been refused because he did not satisfy the requirement of good character. That requirement applies to all applicants over 16 years of age. One of the bases of assessment of good character is whether the applicant has a criminal record. It was decided that he did not meet the good character requirement. On review, the Immigration Review Tribunal recommended that the delegate's decision to refuse permanent resident status be affirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reaching that decision, the panel did not ignore the interests of the children. The decision recorded that Mrs Teoh and family were facing a very bleak and difficult future and would be deprived of a possible breadwinner as well as a father and husband if resident status was not granted. However, the applicant had committed a very serious crime and failed to meet the character requirements for the granting of permanent residency. The compassionate claims were not considered to be compelling enough for the waiver of policy in view of Mr Teoh's criminal record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Teoh then appealed to the Federal Court. At first instance, his claim was dismissed, but he appealed to the full Federal Court which found in his favour. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs then appealed that decision to the High Court. The High Court decided in favour of Mr Teoh. The decision to deport Mr Teoh was stayed until the application for the grant of residence status was reconsidered and determined. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The judgment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reaching this decision, the High Court relied heavily on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty which has not been incorporated into Australian law. The High Court focused on article 3(l) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That article provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>The court found, in effect, that the best interests of Mr Teoh's children had not been `a primary consideration' in the making of the decision not to grant him permanent resident status. The decision of the Immigration Review Tribunal shows, however, as I have indicated, that it was not the case that their interests were ignored. Nevertheless, this was not considered sufficient by the majority of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Teoh case the High Court held that the ratification of a treaty by Australia creates a legitimate expectation that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the treaty provisions, even if they have not been legislated into Australian law. If it is proposed to make a decision inconsistent with that legitimate expectation, it was held that procedural fairness requires that the person affected be given notice and an adequate opportunity to reply. A legitimate expectation amounts only to a procedural right to have the treaty considered, as opposed to a legal right to enforce the terms of the treaty. A decision maker can still decide the other way, so long as she or he has heard the applicant on the issue. However, that is still a significant right. The majority of the court also held that this legitimate expectation could be displaced by a statutory or executive indication to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the Teoh decision, the terms of treaties had not been considered to create rights or obligations in Australian law in the absence of legislation. The High Court confirmed this principle in Teoh. However, the court distinguished between a substantive rule of law and a legitimate expectation that a decision maker will comply with the terms of a treaty. This distinction would have been likely to disappear in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's view that the High Court's decision leads to an untenable situation. It is the government's role to represent Australia on the international plane and this includes international treaty making. However, any changes to the laws of this country which are necessary to implement a treaty and which affect the rights and duties of individuals are a matter for parliament. In the government's view, the Teoh decision provides a means of usurping this legitimate role of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the new procedural right will have significant practical consequences in relation to the myriad of Commonwealth decisions made every day by large numbers of individual decision makers. A substantial allocation of resources would have been necessary. All government decision makers exercising discretionary decision making power would have needed to be educated about the numerous treaty obligations to which Australia is a party. Furthermore, by reason of the new procedural right, there would be likely to be a significant increase in the number of decisions appealed. Even on a rehearing, there would not be a requirement that a decision maker act in accordance with any relevant international obligations. In the government's view, it is wrong for treaties to have this effect domestically without the law being changed by parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a party to over 920 treaties. Australia does not normally become a party to a treaty unless and until it is satisfied that the laws and practices to give effect to that treaty are in place. Therefore the difficulty created by the High Court's decision is twofold: first, to determine which treaties could be relevant to a particular decision. Secondly, it would be necessary for the decision maker to determine the precise meaning of a treaty provision in a particular context. This would not lead to consistency in the interpretation of treaties or in decision making. For example, it can be argued that the Convention on the Rights of the Child does not require a different outcome from that reached by the department in Mr Teoh's case. Certainly that was the view of McHugh J dissenting in that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, it has been suggested incorrectly that the bill winds back Australia's commitment to human rights. That ongoing commitment is demonstrated by the continuing importance of the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. One of the functions of the commission as set out in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 is to hear and conciliate complaints about Commonwealth acts and practices which are alleged to breach human rights set out in the instruments scheduled to the act. Those instruments are: the Convention Concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Declaration of the Rights of the Child; the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons; and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. In 1993 the Convention on the Rights of the Child was declared an instrument relating to human rights and freedoms under the act, as was the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this mechanism, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 provide a legal framework in which the rights they contain are respected in Australia. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is scheduled to the Racial Discrimination Act, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women is scheduled to the Sex Discrimination Act. Similarly, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is scheduled to the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the domestic remedies specifically provided by parliament to deal with complaints of breaches of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the terms of the bill itself. The bill is very narrowly focused. It will restore the situation which existed before the Teoh case. That is, if there are to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from adherence to a treaty, they will result from parliamentary and not executive action. The bill gives effect to the statement by the majority of the High Court that a legitimate expectation arising out of entry into a treaty by Australia can be displaced by executive or legislative action. In this respect it gives legislative effect to the joint statement issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General on 10 May of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has a very confined field of operation: it only prevents a legitimate expectation from arising based on the fact that Australia is bound by, or a party to, a particular international instrument, or that an enactment reproduces or refers to a particular international instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end, the bill will eliminate any expectation which might exist that administrative decisions, whether at the Commonwealth, state or territory level, will be made in conformity with provisions of ratified but unimplemented treaties, or, that if a decision is to be made contrary to such provisions, an opportunity will be given for the affected person to make submissions on the issue. That is clause 5, the only substantive clause in the bill. As I will outline below, the bill will not affect other uses of international law in Australia. For instance, the bill will not affect the use of international law by the courts in the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions; nor will it affect their use of international law as a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the bill is expressed to extend to state and territory decisions is based on the reasoning of the majority judgment of the High Court in the Teoh case. The court found that it was the Commonwealth act of ratification of a treaty which gave rise domestically to the legitimate expectation that administrative decision makers would comply with the terms of those treaties, or, if they did not intend to do so, that they would hear submissions on them. It is not certain from the judgment whether the administrative decisions affected by that Commonwealth act are only those of the Commonwealth government, or whether they are also those of the state and territory administrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since ratification of a treaty is a Commonwealth executive action, it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate to control the effect of that action in Australian domestic law generally. The bill does not prevent any state which wishes to do so from passing a law or taking its own executive actions in relation to treaties accepted by Australia which might themselves create a legitimate expectation. In that case, the legitimate expectation would flow from the state law, and not the Commonwealth executive act of ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the bill put it beyond doubt that parliament is not affecting the way in which treaties may otherwise have some relevance in Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 6 provides that the bill will not affect the operation of treaty provisions which have been incorporated into Australian law. An example is certain of the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which form part of Australian law as provided for in the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 7 provides that the bill does not affect the operation of an enactment in so far as it provides for remedies against, or any procedures for redress of grievances in respect of, breaches of international instruments binding on Australia, or to which Australia is a party. In particular, the bill does not affect the operation of procedures available under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 8 provides that the bill does not affect the operation of an enactment in so far as it provides that compliance with an international instrument is a relevant consideration in making an administrative decision. Nor does the bill make compliance with an international instrument an irrelevant consideration in making an administrative decision where that would otherwise be consistent with the scope and object of the particular statutory provision. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Use of international law by courts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier and as the explanatory memorandum makes clear the use of treaties by the courts both in statutory interpretation and in the development of the common law will not be affected by the bill. Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane referred to two uses of treaties in relation to statutory interpretation in their joint judgment in the Teoh case. The first is that `where a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the courts should favour that construction which accords with Australia's obligations under a treaty or international convention to which Australia is a party . . .'. The second is that `. . . a statute is to be interpreted and applied, as far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity and not in conflict with established rules of international law'. The bill does not affect either of these canons of statutory interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane also stated in the Teoh case that `[t]he provisions of an international convention to which Australia is a party, especially one that declares universal fundamental rights, may be used by the courts as a legitimate guide in developing the common law'. In making this statement their honours relied upon a number of earlier judgments to the same effect made by judges of the High Court. They also relied upon a 1988 decision of Justice Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, in Jago v. Judges of District of New South Wales in which he stated that `[a] more relevant source of guidance in the statement of the common law of this State may be the modem instruments of human rights found in international instruments, prepared by experts, adopted by organs of the United Nations, ratified by Australia and now part of international law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not affect the future use of treaties to which Australia is a party as a source of guidance in the development of the common law. They will remain, in the words of the current Chief Justice of the High Court, a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law. This influence of treaties on the development of Australian common law is to be distinguished from simply importing the terms of an unincorporated convention into Australian law without legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will apply to administrative decisions made on or after 10 May 1995, including such decisions reviewing or determining an appeal in respect of decisions made before that day. This reflects the government's belief that, by reason of the joint statement issued on that date by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General, no legitimate expectations will have arisen on the basis of an international instrument after 10 May 1995. The legislation is designed to reinforce this. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government review of treaties in administrative decision making</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to legislate in the way I have indicated has been criticised as inconsistent with Australia's commitment to meet its treaty obligations. The government has reaffirmed its commitment in this regard. It does wish to ensure that its treaty commitments are met, including in administrative decision making. However, for the reasons indicated, it does not believe that the Teoh decision is the way to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to determine whether there are in fact problem areas in administrative decision making in terms of compliance with treaty obligations, the Attorney-General announced on 5 July this year that his department will carry out a review. This review, in consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other government departments, will initially identify areas of possible concern in relation to the compliance in administrative decisions with the human rights obligations set out in instruments attached to Commonwealth human rights legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this review is to ensure that full and proper consideration is given to those obligations in the decision making process. The reason for the review is to double check that relevant treaty obligations are being taken into account in administrative decision making and, therefore, that Australia is fully implementing the international obligations towards its people that it has voluntarily assumed on the international plane. I say `double check' because international obligations have always been considered very seriously in Australian law and practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review will involve the use of existing resources, and I have not, therefore, set any timetable for its completion. If there are areas where we are not adequately meeting our treaty obligations, we wish to know about them. We can then do something to remedy the situation. This review process will be much more effective than the development of the doctrine of legitimate expectation to cover treaties in ensuring that proper regard is had to our treaty commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill involves no direct financial implications. Its enactment may, however, provide savings in relation to costs of legal action that might otherwise have been brought. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995 is being introduced by the government to override the effect of the High Court's decision in the case of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh, which is more commonly known as Teoh's case. The decision in Teoh's case, handed down earlier this year, affects principles of Australian administrative law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in his speech, the creation of a legitimate expectation is an important aspect of administrative law. Where a legitimate expectation is created, the decision maker must not act contrary to the expectation without giving the person affected by the decision an opportunity otherwise. The effect of the Teoh case is that international treaty obligations create a legitimate expectation for the purposes of administrative law. However, the existence of a legitimate expectation may be displaced by statutory or executive indications to the contrary. That is the situation that we are now in which the government wants to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teoh's case was fully outlined by the minister in his second reading speech, but I will pull out a number of elements of it. The case involved a challenge against a deportation order against a Malaysian national who had been convicted of certain heroin offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since arriving in Australia in 1988, Mr Teoh had married his sister-in-law, an Australian citizen who had been previously widowed. She had four children and together they had a further three children of their own. In 1990, Mr Teoh was convicted, as I said, of a number of heroin offences and sentenced to prison. In 1992 a deportation order was made against him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He appealed to the Federal Court and to the High Court against the deportation on the basis of article 3(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Australia is a signatory. Under article 3(1) of the convention, the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration when making decisions involving the parent, and I think the minister quoted fully that article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full court of the Federal Court found that the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in decisions regarding a parent and that it is a legitimate expectation that actions of the Commonwealth which concern children would be conducted in accordance with the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court upheld that decision, agreeing that the signing of an international convention by the government leads to a legitimate expectation that its provisions will be applied even where the terms of the convention have not been incorporated in an act of parliament. The High Court held that the decision of the official was thus invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad ranging effect of the decision was that treaties entered into between Australia and foreign states were held to give rise to an implied promise to Australian citizens or, as it has been referred to, a legitimate expectation that the elements of that convention would be applied even though not the subject of any enactment in our domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there was a creation of a new procedural right, the decision did not impose an obligation to give effect to a treaty, or to do more than invite submissions as to whether or not the treaty should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the article is one the government might eventually give thought to legislating in the interests of children involving decisions of a parent, I would like to think that in weighing up those matters some consideration might be given also to the interests of other children, particularly those who are likely to be affected by those who trade in heroin and its implications. But balancing up those sorts of matters, which would be a proper role for the parliament, obviously is not a matter that was taken into account in considering this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government did respond to the decision of the High Court by issuing a statement involving the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) on 10 May, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . entering into an international treaty is not reason for raising any expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been enacted in domestic Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court decision gives little if any guidance on how decision-makers are to determine which of those treaty provisions will be relevant and to what decisions the provisions might be relevant, and because of the wide range and large number of decisions potentially affected by the decision, a great deal of uncertainty has been introduced into government activity. It is not in anyone's interests to allow such uncertainty to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite an apparent retreat from government treaty making practices, the press statement provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we should emphasise that the Government remains fully committed to observing its treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>The press statement went on to say that the government intended to legislate to reinforce this position and the bill we now have before us is the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's justification for the bill, namely, that the treaty obligations should not form part of Australian law unless incorporated by legislation, was not the entire reason for its decision. Clearly, another motivating factor for the government is the administrative difficulties the government would suffer in complying with the decision caused by the enormous number of treaties in existence that Australia has ratified and, presumably, not incorporated into our domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the coalition's position on the bill, there have been a number of criticisms and comments made by commentators and interested people around Australia in relation to the government's response to Teoh's case and to this bill. For this reason, on behalf of the opposition I will be proposing a motion that the bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. While the Minister for Justice has left us, we have had some discussions in relation to the role of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the role of the Senate committee that can also deal with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition has no determinative role in relation to the approach that the Senate might take on these matters, we are aware that the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs has a very heavy workload and is prepared to see a positive role assumed by the House of Representatives committee. While that might not necessarily preclude further steps being taken by senators, there is a good deal of reason for believing that, if an important matter of this type were dealt with by a committee of this House, there would be no further reason for review separately in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the second reading stage I will be seeking to suspend the standing and sessional orders to enable me to move a motion to refer this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional affairs for inquiry and report. I would hope that the government would give serious consideration to that matter in this case knowing the time frame in which we are operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However looking at the bill itself, in isolation from the history of the government's less than satisfactory approach to the treaty making process, the specific aim of this bill is supported by the opposition. The effect of the bill is to reverse the effect of Teoh's case. The High Court mandating of applications of obligations contained in treaties into domestic practices bypasses our democratic system. The existence of the obligations are essentially determined by the executive and the parliament&mdash;the states and the people are removed from this process if the impact of this decision is taken into account. It is not for the High Court to unilaterally divest the parliament of a significant part of its role in relation to the implementation of treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that we are in this situation now because the government has handled, I believe incompetently, the way in which the treaty making process is adopted. We think it has taken a very short-sighted approach to these matters. We believe the government has been overwilling to enter into treaties without consideration of the consequences. Certainly, the way in which Teoh's case was dealt with and its outcome&mdash;as well as the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child&mdash;is something that I do not believe any of us would have seen as being a likely consequence of entering into that treaty at that time. It is because of the way in which the treaty making power has been dealt with by the government that I will be moving at the appropriate time an amendment to the second reading of this bill in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

A number of commentators have criticised the government's response. The first criticism stems from a view that Teoh's case was a positive move forward and the bill, by overturning the case, limits the potency of international treaties. The Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists, Sir Ronald Wilson and a number of human rights bodies have been amongst those who have spoken out on this issue. They argue that the Teoh decision, giving extra force to international treaties, represents a worthwhile step in civilising and moderating the use of international treaties in the Australian legal system. One such commentator, Mr Justice Kirby, who has been referred to by the minister, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the High Court's decision in Teoh gave great value and purpose to the ratifying of conventions by the executive government of the Commonwealth of Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that, by introducing the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government is seeking to isolate ratified treaties from any actual impact on Australian domestic life.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Kirby argues that the effect of the bill is that treaties bearing the standard of Australian community life will cease to have relevance. Commenting that the government's moves to overturn Teoh have the effect of relegating international treaties to `window dressing', he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian people will be entitled to ask what happened to the Australian Government's commitment to observing its treaty obligations, and why did we enter into them in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA>The second category of criticism refers to constitutional issues which arise from the bill. Michael Detmold, Professor of Law at Adelaide University, has attacked the bill on two bases. Firstly, he has commented on the government's use of the external affairs power in the constitution. He considers that the government's approach to treaty making is inconsistent. He notes that over the past few years the government has benefited internally from the High Court's expanded interpretation of the Commonwealth's external affairs power. The High Court has been treating Australia's international obligations seriously and has expanded the treaties power to enable the treaties to be implemented. He considers that Teoh's case is merely carrying this through. Detmold has commented that in this situation the extension of the external affairs power is not advantageous to the government so they seek to override it&mdash;they want to have it both ways. In Detmold's words, referring to the government, `they play fast and loose'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Detmold has cast doubt on the constitutional validity of the bill on the basis of the separation of powers doctrine. He says it is the High Court and not the government that is responsible for our constitutional law and by this bill the government seeks to create constitutional law relating to the making of treaties under the Commonwealth external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on treaty making by the government. The government's overeagerness to avoid the operation of the High Court's decision in this matter is very telling. It reveals exactly the problems that exist with the government's treaty making process that the coalition has been highlighting now for a number of years. The opposition has consistently commented that the Labor government's approach to the treaty making process is manifestly inadequate. In an effort to ingratiate itself to elements of the international community it has become a signatory to a host of new treaties and today Australia is a party to no fewer than 900 such treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its effort to enter into treaties the government has failed to, firstly, properly consult with the parliament and, through the parliament, the people; secondly, properly consult with the states, bearing in mind that the existence of treaty obligations extends to the Commonwealth government the power to legislate in the areas that, if not for the treaty, would be the sole responsibility of the states, or primarily the responsibility of the states; and, thirdly, properly consider whether existing domestic arrangements accord with the treaty obligations that have been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to consultation, the Commonwealth government has the power to make treaties under section 51(xxix) of the constitution. This Commonwealth responsibility is derived through the external affairs power, which gives the government the power to interact with the international community. At present, the government may sign international agreements through the executive arm of the government and the treaty is then subject to an automatic ratification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treaty must be tabled before parliament, but the government has ensured that this is effectively irrelevant to the process. In fact, I doubt very much whether members do read on a regular basis the treaties that are tabled in this chamber. The tabling process is more one of record than one of note. For example, on 30 November 1994 the government tabled 36 treaties and gave notice of another 50 treaties which were currently being negotiated. No details were given of the treaties under negotiation and half an hour was allowed for discussion of all 86 treaties&mdash;and I suspect that was only in the Senate, certainly not in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the coalition, notable figures have been very vocal in criticising the government for its lack of consultation in relation to treaties. In a recent lecture titled `The expansion of international law: sovereignty in external affairs', Sir Ninian Stephen referred to the enormous impact of international treaties and argued that the parliament had no formal constitutional role in the process. He commented that in making these international agreements a `democratic deficit was occurring'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Kirby has also been critical of the current process. In his paper titled `Human rights: the international dimension', he commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some important treaties have been ratified with little parliamentary or public debate. The growing body of treaty law has an increasing impact on Australian law. It therefore seems legitimate, in some way, now to involve the national Parliament in the superintendence of Executive action in respect of treaties.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in his paper to call for a dramatic increase in parliamentary scrutiny over the treaty making process. I think that is a very telling criticism, and one of which the government ought to be taking note. When people like Sir Ninian Stephen and Mr Justice Kirby highlight these matters it is not just the cause that is being taken up by the opposition, it is of a very much wider dimension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the domestic effect, the government admitted in its press release of 10 May this year that the Teoh decision may lead to uncertainty and confusion. This is a reference to the supposed difficulties that may arise when officials try to reconcile the obligations contained in a treaty with existing Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that potential administrative difficulties for officials is only a potential problem as a result of the government's failure to ensure that the treaties it has entered into are consistent with our current domestic law. In other words, it is only the government's failure to examine each and every one of those treaties before they have been entered into that has affected its knowledge of what the likely impact is going to be here. It should have that taken fully into account not only with the Commonwealth but also with the states. This is quite an absurd situation. If Australia makes a commitment to the world community, it should be in the position to give domestic effect to those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has some views on the issue of reform. I just want to put those briefly. Over a period of time we have criticised the government's current approach to the treaty making process. Rather than merely criticise, we have committed ourselves to reforming the process. I just want to outline what those commitments are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first commitment is to ensure that the Australian parliament, the states and the wider community are given proper and timely involvement in international law making by Australian governments, including, where appropriate, cost-benefit analysis in terms of Australia's national interests prior to any ratification of a treaty. The second is to legislate to require that treaties be tabled with provision for debate in the federal parliament&mdash;and that has to be real debate&mdash;prior to ratification. The third is to establish a treaties council as part of COAG. This initiative will be associated with a general strengthening of the consultative process. The fourth is to work with the states to ensure that, where possible, domestic legislation is in place prior to the ratification of treaties. The fifth is to establish a joint house treaties committee to provide detailed analysis of the implications of any prospective signing or ratification of an international treaty by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to contrast this approach that the opposition intends to take with the way in which the government sees this matter. I do so by drawing attention to the concluding statements of the Minister for Justice in his second reading speech on this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to legislate in the way I have indicated has been criticised as inconsistent with Australia's commitment to meet its treaty obligations. The government has reaffirmed its commitment in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Attorney-General announced on 5 July this year that his department will carry out a review. This review, in consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other government departments, will initially identify areas of possible concern in relation to the compliance in administrative decisions with the human rights obligations set out in instruments attached to Commonwealth human rights legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not remarkable in relation to this matter, having to legislate in these terms at this time because of the situation we have reached, that the government still does not see any role for the national parliament in this process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no role for any parliamentary committee in the review. It is seen as a matter that needs to be dealt with by the executive and its agencies. It seems to me that the government and its advisers are comfortable with this approach. That is not an approach that this side of the parliament is comfortable with. We believe there needs to be a positive role for the parliament. The impact of these decisions to ratify need to be clearly thought through long before the ratification process is concluded and obligations arise. We would not be in this situation if we had been taking that approach, and particularly if the opposition initiatives which we have announced had been followed by the government. It is for that reason that I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995 is basically to clarify Australia's position with regard to our obligations and rights under international treaties, whether we have legislated them or not into Australian law. Under the Teoh decision, the High Court has appeared to create rights and obligations that were not intended under Australian law in the absence of legislation. The bill will restore the situation which existed before the Teoh case in which, if there were to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from our adhering to a treaty, they would be made by parliamentary and not executive action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Teoh case is a very different one as it does have people to consider other than Teoh himself. But people have to be aware of their responsibilities and be responsible for their actions, and act accordingly. Mr Teoh committed a very serious crime; he must have realised the implications when he committed it. Drug importation and possession, after all, is a capital offence in Malaysia, so he must have known how serious the situation was that he was involved in. He was asking for his temporary entry visa to become a permanent one during the time that he was charged and convicted of this crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the High Court decision were to remain, it would lead to an untenable situation. It is the government's role to represent Australia on the international plane, and this includes international treaty making. However, any changes to the laws of this country which are necessary to implement a treaty and which affect the rights and duties of individuals are a matter for the parliament. Just think of the practical consequences in relation to thousands of Commonwealth decisions made every day by large numbers of individual decision makers: there would need to be more money and resources put into that. People would have to be educated about the numerous treaty obligations, and it would probably lead to a considerable number of decisions being appealed. I do not think it is wrong for treaties to have this effect domestically without the law; I think it is wrong without the law being changed by parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whatever we might feel about Mr Teoh's family, it is inappropriate to have one situation for their position and another that may, for instance, disadvantage a family in Australia in some way. For instance, I had a young fellow see me the other day who had recently married and begun a family. He told me that he was being harassed by a young woman that he had had a brief affair with and who had fallen pregnant. He told me the woman meant nothing to him, that it was only a brief encounter, and that she was now asking for maintenance payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then said that he had a new family and asked how he was supposed to pay for both. That one night or those two nights of irresponsible gratification had led to some unwanted responsibilities. But does that person have the right to say, `No, it wasn't my fault. I was trapped into the situation; therefore, I should not pay'? This young man, through his stupid action, now has to pay for the rest of his life: he will be paying a maintenance bill until that child is an adult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have to take responsibilities for their actions, whether they be male or female. If you personally do not want to have a child, then it is up to you to take the necessary precautions or desist altogether. I make that connection between these two cases, in that it would be quite unjust if we were to allow the family of Teoh to become residents of Australia on the one side, despite the actions of the father, and insist that the young man with the two families pay for them on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure I could argue, if I were a lawyer, that there would be some international convention that would allow a change in the domestic decisions of legislation by government because of a treaty that may have some powers to intervene and interfere with the Family Law Act. Of course, that is what was done. It is about time too that people who break the law or who are unthinking in their day-to-day lives should take responsibility for their actions. It is not good enough to try to put the blame somewhere else or use legal loopholes to get out of those responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are too many anomalies if the High Court decision is not coped with under this legislation. Australia proposes to meet its treaty obligations, but not in the way the Teoh decision went. A review is being carried out in consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other government departments. This will initially identify areas of possible concern relating to compliance, in administrative decisions, with the human rights obligations set out in instruments attached to the Commonwealth human rights legislation. It will assess whether we are adequately meeting our treaty obligations or not and what we can do about it. This in the long run will provide savings of costs of legal action that might otherwise be brought forward. I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill amounts to the chickens coming home to roost for the government. It is a case of the government wanting to be able to have its cake and eat it too in relation to international treaties and conventions. This ought to be looked at in the context of the number of conventions and treaties which this government, this executive, has entered into on behalf of Australia over its term of office. As the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a continual and gradual increase in the number of treaties entered into by Australia over the period . . . Significant expansion has occurred in particular multilateral areas, most notably in human rights and preservation of the environment, reflecting international concerns and the growing interdependence of States.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill needs to be looked at against the background of the convention to which it relates and the background of the case in question and the judgment of the High Court. What we have here today is the executive saying that a judgment of the High Court will not be accepted by this government and will be overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention that we are dealing with in this legislation&mdash;the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child&mdash;was ratified by the Australian government on 17 December 1990 and entered into force for Australia on 16 January 1991. On 22 December 1992, the Attorney-General declared the convention to be an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms, this declaration being made pursuant to section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point is to recognise that the government ratified and entered into the Convention on the Rights of the Child as an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms pursuant to a law duly passed by this parliament&mdash;namely, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. If one then goes to the articles of the convention, there are a number of telling sentences in relation to this matter. Article 3 of the convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 9 of the convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the governments that ratify these conventions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.</PARA>
<PARA>In both article 3 and article 9 of this international convention which this government ratified, the notion of the best interests of the child is clearly stated. It is not a matter which is unknown in Australian law. For example, in the Family Law Act, which deals with the divorce and separation of couples, we see the fundamental proposition that the best interests of the child are to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case which gives rise to this bill coming before the House, a Mr Teoh, a Malaysian citizen, came to Australia in 1988 and was granted a temporary entry permit. On 9 July he married Jean Helen Lim, an Australian citizen who had been the de facto spouse of his deceased brother. At the time of the marriage Mrs Teoh had four children, the eldest being the child of her first marriage and the other three being the children of her de facto relationship with the respondent's brother. In addition, there were three children of the marriage between Mr and Mrs Teoh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the government sought to deport Mr Teoh on the basis that he had been convicted, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) indicated, of drug charges. They were undoubtedly serious charges. In the process of the conviction it was contended that there was no consideration given to the best interests of the children, yet this convention which the government entered into said that it would not be bound by any administrative decision made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the decisions of the courts in this matter because they have, to some extent, been conveniently overlooked. When the matter first came to court, Mr Justice Lee said that he considered that the action of the government, in ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child, was a statement to the national and international communities that the Commonwealth recognised and accepted the principles of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is hardly an arguable case. We have a government which signs a convention and then says it is a convention for the purposes of an Australian statute. It is hardly arguable to turn around and say that that was not a statement to the people of Australia or to the international community that we accept the principles of the convention, one of the most important of which is the principle of the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter ultimately went to the High Court, and that is why we are debating this issue today. When it went to the High Court, the High Court looked at the status of this convention so far as the law of Australia was concerned. The High Court said, quite rightly, in what has been well accepted in this country, that provisions of an international treaty to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless those provisions have been validly incorporated into our municipal law by statute. That is, the terms of the provisions of law cannot be relied upon, on the face of those terms, unless they are made part of Australian law by an act of parliament passing through this place and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the High Court went on to ask the obvious question: if a government enters into a treaty or convention and says to the people of Australia and the whole world, `This is an international convention which we consider it important to enter into,' has it got any status at all in terms of the law of this country? I quote from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the High Court, Justice Mason, and Justice Deane, who say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the fact that the Convention has not been incorporated into Australian law does not mean that its ratification holds no significance for Australian law. Where a statute or subordinate legislation is ambiguous, the courts should favour the construction which accords with Australia's obligations under a treaty or international convention to which Australia is a party, at least in those cases in which the legislation is enacted after, or in contemplation of, entry into, or ratification of, the relevant international instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is because Parliament, prima facie, intends to give effect to Australia's international obligations under international law. It is accepted that a statute is to be interpreted and applied, as far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity and not in conflict with the established rules of international law.</PARA>
<PARA>In his judgment, Mr Justice Toohey made a similar point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the matter is approached in terms of legitimate expectation, it is no answer for the appellant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Commonwealth of Australia, the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to argue that the Convention does not give rise to individual rights and obligations in municipal law. The question rather is whether Australia's ratification of the Convention results in an expectation that those making administrative decisions under the aegis of the executive government of the Commonwealth will act in accordance with the Convention wherever it is relevant to the decision to be made.</PARA>
<PARA>What the High Court was saying is that this is not a law which an ordinary citizen of Australia can rely upon like the law of contract or the Family Law Act; it is not part of our domestic law. But, given that the executive government of the Commonwealth entered into this convention, there is a legitimate expectation that we in Australia meant to give effect to it and we are simply not going to ignore it when it is convenient, in the face of the international community to whom we signed it. In probably one of the most telling paragraphs in the judgment of the High Court, Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, ratification by Australia of an international convention is not to be dismissed as a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act, particularly when the instrument evidences internationally accepted standards to be applied by courts and administrative authorities in dealing with basic human rights affecting the family and children. Rather, ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention. That positive statement is an adequate foundation for the legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers will act in conformity with the Convention and treat the best interests of children as "a primary consideration".</PARA>
<PARA>As the High Court said, the ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here today in this bill is the government, having signed the convention, having gone out to the Australian people, campaigned on and championed the conventions on the right of the child, saying in a myriad of fora around this country that `the best interests of the child' is something to be upheld as a universal principle of human rights. But when it is inconvenient for them to uphold it they want to overturn this and say, `Oh, no, this should not create any legitimate expectation in the minds of the Australian people&mdash;and surely not in the minds of the bureaucrats who have to administer government decisions.' As I said, this is a case of the government wanting to have its cake and eat it too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same point was made in a case elsewhere when the New Zealand Court of Appeal said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is an unattractive argument, apparently implying that New Zealand's adherence to the international instruments has been at least partly window-dressing . . . there must at least be hesitation about accepting that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I say to this House today: there ought to be hesitation in accepting what this government puts forward because in accepting this bill we are accepting that when the government of Australia goes out and signs conventions and treaties it is at least partly window-dressing. We are saying to the international community, `We will sign on the dotted line. Yes, we believe in the best interests of the child, but when it is inconvenient for us in terms of decisions we will ignore that principle and we will simply treat it as window-dressing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that the High Court is right when it says that there are legitimate expectations raised once this convention has been signed. The interesting thing is that this bill may not entirely overcome the problem. When you look at the decision of the High Court you can see a number of instances where the High Court accepted that the common law could be developed by influence of international conventions. As Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane said in the judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from influencing the construction of a statute or subordinate legislation, an international convention may play a part in the development by the courts of the common law. The provisions of an international convention to which Australia is a party, especially one which declares universal fundamental rights, may be used by the courts as a legitimate guide in developing the common law.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Gaudron made the same point in her judgment, when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is arguable that citizenship carries with it a common law right on the part of children and their parents to have a child's best interests taken into account, at least as a primary consideration, in all discretionary decisions by governments and government agencies which directly affect that child's individual welfare, particularly decisions which affect children as dramatically and as fundamentally as those involved in this case.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is at least a hint or obiter dicta, as lawyers would say, on the part of three judges of the High Court that the best interests of the child is such a universal fundamental principle that it can be incorporated by the High Court into the common law of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the government say about that? This is the government which was cheering the High Court decision in Mabo in which the High Court took principles from the international arena, from the international dimension, in the development of law and said that those principles could be incorporated into the common law of Australia. That is what Justices Gaudron and Deane and Chief Justice Mason were hinting at, at least, if not directly stating in the decision in this case. That is consistent with what the High Court has done in a series of cases. As Justice Michael Kirby, the President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several of the trail-blazing decisions of the High Court . . . were influenced by the fact that what Australian courts decide can now be scrutinised (and criticised) by the UN body [the United Nations Human Rights Committee].</PARA>
<PARA>He has pointed out elsewhere that there has been this influence on the High Court in the development of the common law in a way which did not occur, say, 10 or 15 years ago. The chief justice himself has said that an important and legitimate influence on the development of the common law are international conventions and treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in his second reading speech on this bill seemed to endorse what the chief justice himself had said. So we have here the court saying&mdash;and it is clear from a series of cases over the past few years&mdash;that international law and such things as conventions and universal rights can be taken into account as part of the development of the common law. Even this statute may have limited effect if the High Court is so minded to say that, as part of the common law of this country, there is a fundamental principle that the best interests of the child ought to be taken into account.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It emphasises what the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, said recently when he accused the federal government of hypocrisy. He said that the proposed laws to limit the impact of international treaties on local law would undermine human rights. Sir Ronald, of course, is a former High Court judge. He said that the government was overreacting to the High Court's ruling in the Teoh case. That seems to be the attitude of the government in relation to a whole series of cases which involve migration matters. The government tends to go off half-cocked half the time. Sir Ronald Wilson said that it was hypocritical for the government to say that it supported the convention and would fight for it to be observed in the international community, but then the Commonwealth bureaucrats had made a decision that the treaty principles should be overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us back to the whole problem that we have in Australia at the present time&mdash;the process by which international conventions and treaties are entered into and what say, in any democratic sense, the people of Australia have in that process. As Sir Ninian Stephen has said, parliament seems to have no formal role in the ratification of treaties. It was what he described as a democratic deficit. Justice Kirby has said that it is appropriate for parliaments to have an involvement in relation to international treaties. </PARA>

It is ridiculous to say that we can sign such treaties, but then bureaucrats working on behalf of the government can simply ignore them in their day-to-day activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995. As others have indicated, this is difficult but necessary legislation. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) mentioned the role of this parliament in relation to treaties and conventions. I, like many members on both sides of this House, share his view that parliament should undertake a greater role. How that is to be achieved could be worked out. In the report that was brought down last year by the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it was recommended that parliament have a greater role before the government signs or ratifies treaties and conventions. I do not see why the matter could not be debated in the House, even in the second chamber, or sent to a parliamentary committee or a special committee. The honourable member for Menzies would find a lot of support in this House. He is not the first to say it; it has been said on both sides of the parliament. The parliament should have a greater role to play before the government signs or ratifies international conventions or treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members are aware, this legislation was seen to be necessary following the decision of the High Court in the Teoh case, in which the court found that Australia's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child created a legitimate expectation in parents and children that Commonwealth decisions should, in the normal course of events, be based primarily on the provision of that convention. One of the main points at issue in this matter is that, while the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by the Australian government, its provisions have not been incorporated in Australian domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the question of how binding these provisions on Commonwealth decision makers are. An example is those in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs who rejected Mr Teoh's application for a permanent entry permit. In the Teoh case, the High Court came to the decision that the department's decision makers had used unfair procedures, first, by not making their decision in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, second, by failing to give Mr Teoh the opportunity to argue against their decision on the basis that they had ignored those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, however, has taken the position that, while this convention has been ratified and its provisions are of value, they have no binding force until such time as the parliament incorporates them into Australian law. In other words, the government is saying that the responsibility for making change to procedural and substantive rights in Australian law properly belongs to the parliament, not the judiciary. This point was made by the honourable member for Menzies. Perhaps he is more concerned about this than I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A due process should be followed. In the first place, it is the responsibility of the government to ratify international conventions and treaties. Secondly, it is the responsibility of the parliament to make new legislation or amend existing legislation should it wish to incorporate the provisions of those international instruments into Australian law. Finally, the proper use of the role of the court is to interpret and apply such legislation to the cases that are brought before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This having been said, the government certainly recognises the right of the court to make use of international conventions and treaties, once ratified, even before their provisions are incorporated into Australian law. There are two common circumstances where the court is likely to exercise this right. The first is when it uses these provisions as a guide to interpreting an ambiguous case. The second is when it wishes to develop or refine an existing common law practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is obviously a need for the judiciary to exercise some caution when applying the provisions of international instruments which have not been incorporated expressly into Australian law. This is especially so when it seeks to further develop an existing common law principle or apply the natural law. The question then arises as to how one can distinguish between developing an existing principle and moving over that rather nebulous borderline into the area of making new law. In my view, this debate will go on for some time yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two further questions spring to mind. The first is this: in the light of all that has been said, is it of any use to ratify international conventions and treaties? My answer to this is a resounding yes. I do not share the view of some in this House that, by Australia entering into international treaties and conventions, we are somehow surrendering our sovereignty. We are reinforcing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has now ratified 900 United Nations conventions and treaties. Some of them have had a profound effect on our society and have done much to advance the course of justice and equity. One has only to think of the use to which the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights was put in Australia during the 1950s and 1960s by those seeking citizenship rights for Aboriginal people. There has been another worthwhile effect in adopting those international instruments. The ratification of these conventions and treaties by the majority of the world's nations has increased the pressure on other nations to do likewise or else face international ostracism, as was the case with South Africa until very recently. In addition, signatory nations that are tempted to not honour the provisions of these treaties and conventions find it increasingly difficult to ignore the weight of adverse world opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important question concerns the balance of power and the respective roles of the parliament and the judiciary. I might here make the rather obvious distinction that, while it is the people of Australia who elect the parliament and the government, it is the government that appoints the judges of the High Court. The role of the parliament is to pass legislation; the role of the judiciary is to interpret and apply that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those who criticise the High Court for overstepping the mark. They claim it has gone beyond its proper role of applying the law and moved into the arena of making law. There was some discussion on this earlier this year, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. Critics of the High Court point to cases such as Mabo and claim that it has become too proactive in interpreting and applying the law. I happen to disagree with this view. Each case of alleged overstepping of the mark must, of course, be judged on its merits but, by and large, I do not subscribe to the conservative view that the High Court should restrict itself to a narrow and overcautious interpretation of existing law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been times in our history when the Australian government has ignored the need for legislative change at its own peril&mdash;for example in 1971 when it chose to ignore Justice Blackburn's suggestion following the Gove case that the government might consider implementing legislation which would recognise some form of native title. The government's failure to do so had the direct consequence of provoking the establishment of the Aboriginal tent embassy outside Parliament House, and this of course led to a fundamental rewriting of the nation's political agenda. The High Court's Mabo decision, some 20 years later, finally provided the breakthrough in law that the indigenous people of Australia had been denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, the old argument that the judicial system is more concerned with protecting the property rights of the `haves' than defending the human rights of the `have nots'. While there may be some truth in that argument, I have seen no evidence of such bias in the case of the Mason High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, when it comes to the question of the balance of power between the judiciary and the parliament, what is required is not the dominance of the one over the other but rather a robust tension between the two. I see this tension as a sign of the health of our democratic process and an indication of its inherent strength. Ideally, the parliament and the High Court should be working towards the same goal: to build a more just and humane Australian society in which the rights and obligations of all its people are recognised and safeguarded. Properly used, international conventions and treaties are valuable tools in doing that just. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents of this legislation argue that it shifts the balance too much in favour of the parliament and away from the judiciary. I accept that this is not the intent of the legislation. Its aim is to define more clearly the relative roles and responsibilities of the government, the parliament and the judiciary when dealing with international conventions and treaties. </PARA>

The bill is the government's response to the decision handed down by the High Court on 7 April 1995 in the case of the Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Ah Hin Teoh. The purpose of the bill is to reverse the effect of the High Court's decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Teoh was a Malaysian citizen who arrived in Australia in 1988 and was granted a temporary entry permit. That same year he married Jean Lim, an Australian citizen. Mrs Teoh had four children of her own and there are three children of the marriage. In 1989, Mr Teoh applied for a permanent entry permit. In 1990 he was convicted of importing and possessing heroin and was sentenced to six years gaol. In 1991 Mr Teoh was refused a permanent entry permit because his criminal record prevented him meeting the requirement that he be of good character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ordered that Mr Teoh be deported. Mr Teoh successfully appealed against the deportation decision, ultimately to the full Federal Court. That court said that, simply by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Australia had not made the convention a part of Australian law. Nevertheless, the court held that the ratification alone created a legitimate expectation in parents or children that an action by the Commonwealth would be conducted in accordance with the principles of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia had ratified the convention in December 1990, and it entered into force for Australia in January 1991.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in all actions concerning children . . . the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Court held that, when the minister's delegate made her decision to deport Mr Teoh, she had not made the effect that deporting Mr Teoh would have on his children a primary consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The minister appealed to the High Court, and the High Court dismissed the appeal by a majority of four to one. The leading judgment was given by the then Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason and Justice Deane jointly. Their Honours said that the United Nations convention was relevant to the making of the deportation decision and that the decision refusing Mr Teoh a permanent entry permit was an action concerning children. Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane affirmed the importance of international treaties and conventions when they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ratification by Australia of an international convention is not to be dismissed as a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act, particularly when the instrument evidences internally accepted standards to be applied by courts and administrative authorities in dealing with basic human rights affecting the family and children. Rather, ratification of a convention is a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That positive statement is an adequate foundation for a legitimate expectation, absent statutory or executive indications to the contrary, that administrative decision-makers will act in conformity with the Convention and treat the best interest of the child as `a primary consideration'.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Toohey agreed with this, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows that while Australia's ratification of the Convention does not go so far as to incorporate it into domestic law, it does have consequences for agencies of the executive government of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Gaudron agreed with Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane about the status of the convention in Australian law. Justice McHugh was the sole dissenting voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 10 May this year, following the Teoh decision, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) issued a joint statement in the form of a media release. The ministers said that it was issued to clarify the government's position following the Teoh case. The ministers said in the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the High Court decision gives little if any guidance on how decision-makers are to determine which . . . treaty provisions will be relevant and to what decisions the provisions might be relevant, and because of the wide range and large number of decisions potentially affected by the decision, a great deal of uncertainty has been introduced into government activity. It is not in anybody's interests to allow such uncertainty to continue.</PARA>
<PARA>I might suggest that determination of what is relevant is a matter that is dealt with on a day by day basis in all departments. It does not raise any uncertainty that does not already exist. The statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For that reason, the Government is taking action to restore the position to what it was understood to be prior to the Teoh case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This action is of the kind foreshadowed by the High Court itself. In its judgment, the Court acknowledged that the expectation in question can be displaced by `statutory or executive indications to the contrary'. . . . So far as the Executive is concerned, the Court made it clear that it was open for Government to make a statement about the effect that the obligations undertaken in international law by reason of treaty ratification are intended to have in the domestic law of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now make such a clear and express statement. We state on behalf of the Government, that entering into an international treaty is not reason for raising any expectation that Government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of that treaty have not been enacted into domestic Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement then went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government intends to legislate to reinforce this statement and put beyond doubt the status of these unlegislated international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's attempt to neutralise the High Court's Teoh judgment was rightly met with criticism from eminent quarters. The President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, and United Nations Human Rights Committee member the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt, as well as some constitutional lawyers and civil rights organisations, said that the Evans-Lavarch statement called into question Australia's seriousness about its international obligations. They said it was strange for the same government that ratified key human rights treaties to say that its bureaucrats could ignore their provisions unless parliament implements them in Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this pressure the Attorney-General was forced to announce, on 5 July this year, a review of the extent to which Australia's treaty commitments are recognised in Commonwealth decision making. The review is to be conducted by the Attorney-General's Department in consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and other government departments. In the media release in which he announced it, the Attorney-General said that the review would `initially focus on areas of possible concern in relation to the application of the human rights obligations as set out in instruments attached to Commonwealth human rights legislation'. I am somewhat surprised that such a review had not been done at the time each relevant international instrument was entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning, the government's aim in proposing this bill is to reverse the effect of the Teoh decision. Its purpose is stated in the explanatory memorandum to be:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will apply to administrative decisions, made on or after 10 May 1995, including such decisions reviewing, or determining an appeal in respect of, decisions made before that day. This reinforces the effect of the Joint Statement, in that from 10 May 1995, no legitimate expectations will have arisen on the basis of an international instrument.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the bill will have a retrospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the government's outraged response to the Teoh case is the supreme irony. The majority in the Teoh case said in effect that this government must realise that it cannot have its cake and eat it. When the government in cabinet ratifies a treaty it acknowledges to the world its intention to comply with certain solemn obligations. In introducing this bill the same government says to the Australian people that those obligations mean nothing because they have not yet been used by the government to pass legislation implementing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been arguing for some time that the Hawke and Keating Labor governments have not hesitated to use Australia's international treaty obligations to arrogate legislative power to the Commonwealth. We have seen notable examples of the federal Labor governments relying on the external affairs power in the Commonwealth constitution to enable them to introduce laws in areas formerly the preserve of the states. In seeking to override state laws in these cases, the Commonwealth has ignored the proper constitutional division of responsibilities between the parties to the federal compact. The result of this has been to centralise power with the Commonwealth at the expense of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Teoh case put the government's sincerity over Australia's responsibilities as an international citizen to the test, and found it wanting. The High Court decision highlighted the significance for domestic purposes of entering into a treaty. The High Court rightly assumed the government sincerely intended to implement its international obligations on the domestic plane. The government has repudiated that intention. This latest example of the Keating government's arrogance and cynicism is most revealing and is most disturbing. What is worse is that it does little for Australia's international standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to reverse the High Court's decision, the government impliedly rejects the interpretation placed by Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane on the act of ratification when they said that it is not to be dismissed as a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act. The government is in effect saying that domestically it is a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act. When the bill is passed what message will be sent to the Australian people and to the rest of the world about the meaning of an undertaking by the government on behalf of Australians at the international level?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes that this bill should have a retrospective effect dating back to the date of the ministers' joint statement on 10 May 1995. The statement of the ministers purported to be an `executive indication' of the type referred to in the High Court decision in the Teoh case, that this government does not intend ratified treaties to give rise to any legitimate expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are serious questions as to whether the ministers' joint statement has the legal effect to which it lays claim. Indeed, Mr Henry Burmester, Acting Chief General Counsel in the Attorney-General's Department, said in an address to a forum of the Australian Institute of Administrative Law on 18 May 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Court referred to statutory or executive indications to the contrary they were probably thinking of a provision in a particular statute or in a set of guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>In the words of Associate Professor Margaret Allars of the University of Sydney in a paper published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Law Review</EMPHASIS> in June this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to the claim made in the Joint Statement, the majority judges never contemplated that government would publicly expose a lack of integrity in its approach to the ratification of an international convention. For the Joint Statement plainly states that ratification of a convention gives no reason to expect that government decision-makers will comply with the convention if it is not incorporated into municipal law.</PARA>
<PARA>If, as has been suggested, the ministers' joint statement is ineffective, the government intends the retrospective reach of this bill to rectify the problem. But, in operating retrospectively, the bill could retrospectively deprive people of their legal rights. This, as in all cases of retrospectivity, is unjust and abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the joint statement was effective, however, there would be no need for this bill to be retrospective because no legitimate expectation could have arisen since 10 May 1995. Thus, the use of retrospectivity in this fashion is clearly shown to be a backstop for the government's own inefficiency, negligence or maladministration. That has become a regular feature of the present government's legislation. This is but one reason why I support the proposal of the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) that the bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government no doubt intends to continue, in its dying days, to sign and ratify treaties for Australia. One hopes that at least some of the treaties signed will be entered into for the legitimate reason of advancing the national interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also do not have any reason to believe that the government will properly consider whether domestic arrangements accord with treaty obligations before it undertakes those obligations; nor do I expect that the government will properly consult the parliament and the people before signing or ratifying a treaty; nor do I feel optimistic that the government will properly consult the states before it signs or ratifies a national instrument; and nor do I have any confidence that the government will consult industry and other interest groups involved in the subject matter of prospective treaties before they are signed, ratified and come into force for Australia. </PARA>

I am not talking about the whole of the cabinet, because in many cases the whole of the cabinet has not been involved in the decision as to whether Australia should adhere to some sort of international instrument. In some cases, it is a matter decided upon by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) or even the relevant portfolio minister and taken to the Executive Council. Who sits on the Executive Council? The Governor-General, who acts on the advice of the government, quite properly, and sometimes just a couple of parliamentary secretaries. That is the way under this government that treaties&mdash;if you could use that grand phrase&mdash;or international instruments are entered into. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is offhanded arrogance, and the government's attitude when I as Leader of the Opposition and other members of the party, in particular Senator Kemp and the member for Tangney, raised it&mdash;even before I became Leader of the Opposition; it was their leadership which got me interested in the issue&mdash;has just been to dismiss us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Gareth Evans and I spoke at a constitutional convention at the Old Parliament House earlier this year, in March or so, it was proposed by that constitutional convention that the parliament should at least have some role in the treaty making process, but Senator Evans said he did not want treaty making to be subjected to the vagaries of the parliament. Goodness me! Fancy a democratic institution having a say in the way treaties and, therefore, domestic law are made in Australia. What an outrage to think that the parliament, the legislature&mdash;of which you are a member, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile&mdash;should have a say. This is the Evans attitude. If ever there was an illustration of people who have been in power for far too long and who have become drunk and arrogant with the execution of power, it was Senator Evans's attitude to this issue of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No sooner had Senator Evans made this remark than he changed his tune. He changed his tune because of the Teoh case which has underlined the impact of international instruments on domestic laws in Australia, and the government now has had to find some way of responding to that. So along comes this legislation, which is legislation that in fact concedes the point that we have been making all along. The point that we have been making is that you can sign an international instrument and, having signed the international instrument, that does have an impact on domestic law. You can see that in some of the judgments of judges of the High Court. For instance, in the Mabo case there were references to international obligations, and there have been other instances of that. Then along came the Teoh case, and the government suddenly recognised that it had to do something about this issue. So along comes this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put things into a bit of perspective here. The first point I want to make is that the coalition is not opposed to treaty making or to signing conventions, including United Nations conventions: of course we are not. We recognise, and indeed encourage, the emergence of globalism. Globalism is an inevitable force. So treaty making and convention signing and the like will be part of the emergence of globalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second point is that the current treaty making processes are inadequate to the task of managing this growth in international law making. In so far as the current treaty making practice was ever all right, ever adequate and appropriate, it was adequate and appropriate at a time when treaty making basically involved signing treaties of war and peace but not treaties that affected the way the taxation system works, or human rights, or other sorts of very domestic issues. Treaty making did not involve that sort of thing, particularly in the last century or in the early part of this century when our constitution was written. Now that has all changed, so the current treaty making processes are inadequate for the new system that has emerged in international law making. Thirdly, there is compelling evidence of direct and undesirable impacts from treaty making, treaty signing and convention signing on domestic laws and also the division of powers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish today by saying a bit about the coalition's reform proposals which the member for Tangney has spoken about already. As far as this particular legislation is concerned, I will not add to what others have said already in this House due to a shortage of time, but I repeat the point I made, that the High Court in its Teoh judgment has highlighted the government's own weaknesses on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I floated the idea&mdash;I did not commit the coalition to it&mdash;of some sort of legislation along these lines: in a speech I made on 3 May 1995 to the University of New South Wales, and one I made on 6 May 1995 to the Constitutional Centenary Foundation conference, I said that one of the things the government could do would be to introduce a Commonwealth treaties act, which would have amongst its functions a term which would `prevent international instruments from giving rise to an expectation that the instrument would be subject to consideration in the making of an administrative decision by a servant of the Commonwealth, unless the instrument had been designated as a relevant consideration by express reference by an act of parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, that is exactly what this legislation does. I suppose you could say that this legislation does return some of the legislative power to the parliament rather than vest it in the executive, which, as I have explained already, has become increasingly the norm under this government's approach to treaty making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to say a bit more about the current treaty making process. I have said a little bit about that already. The power to make treaties, as members know, derives from the external affairs powers as set out in section 51 (xxix) of the constitution. Its objective is to allow the Australian government to interact with the international community. At present, the Commonwealth can sign treaties and conventions which bind Australia merely through the actions of executive government. I have given some illustrations of how that works in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no need, as I have said already, for the cabinet to make a decision on conventions which can bind Australia in international law. The parliament is irrelevant to that process. I want to give an example of the way the government treats the parliament in treaty making&mdash;with complete disdain and utter contempt. It is something the bureaucracy and the politicians in the government need to understand, because in six months time, when the election is out of the way, this sort of behaviour is not going to continue. We will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 30 November last year, Senator Evans, thinking that things were getting a bit rough on this treaty issue, tabled 36 treaties in the Senate and gave notice of a further 50. How much time did he allow for discussion of those 36 treaties and conventions and the further 50 which were put on notice&mdash;86 altogether? Half an hour, with a maximum of five minutes per speaker. That does not allow for many speakers&mdash;six speakers speaking for five minutes each, on 86 treaties. And that was the sum total of legislative consultation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States Senate has to ratify all treaties and conventions signed by the United States government. It is true that that limits the number that are signed, but at least it ensures that the legislature and, therefore, democratic propriety are involved in the ratification of those treaties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have argued that international treaty making has limited impact in Australia. I thought in the limited time available to me I would quote Sir Ninian Stephen in his Sir Earle Page memorial trust lecture entitled `The expansion of international law&mdash;Sovereignty in external affairs'. Sir Ninian, who I think members would agree is one of the most distinguished of all Australian jurists and distinguished beyond the law, referred to the huge impact that international treaties are having on the sovereignty of states. Sir Ninian said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In countries around the world, vast areas of human activity are now regulated by law, which owe their origin and their substance, not to the initiative of national legislatures (except in the quite subsidiary role of legislating to give effect to a pre-existing </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">international obligation) but to international conventions, agreements and declarations.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Ninian went on to point out that in making these international arrangements a democratic deficit was occurring. That is an expression that comes back from time to time. He argued that parliament has no formal constitutional role in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar views were put by Justice Kirby in his paper delivered in February this year, `Human rights&mdash;The international dimension'. Justice Kirby is worth quoting because he is a great champion of human rights. I admire him for that, being a strong supporter of human rights initiatives myself unlike the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The minister at the table, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), should have seen what he said to Li Peng about Hong Kong and the process of democratisation in Hong Kong. You ought to have a look at that. You probably do not remember the occasion. Justice Kirby observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some important treaties have been ratified with little parliamentary or public debate. The growing body of treaty law has an increasing impact on Australian law. It therefore seems legitimate, in some way, now to involve the national Parliament in the superintendence of Executive action in respect of treaties. The old rule may have been apt for a time when international law was in its infancy. But nowadays, in economic matters as well as those relevant to human rights, the growth of international treaty law is extremely significant and growing even more important.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Kirby went on to call for a dramatic increase in parliamentary scrutiny over the treaty making process. Let me conclude by saying a little bit about the coalition's reform  proposals which were put together last year. People such as the member for Tangney and Senator Kemp were very involved in the process of preparing the coalition's reform proposals. That should be remembered and placed on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put forward several initiatives. Firstly, we believe a cost-benefit analysis of a treaty or convention should be prepared prior to signature. The government should ensure that the Commonwealth parliament, the states and the wider community are given proper and timely involvement in international law making, including, where appropriate, cost-benefit analyses in terms of national interests, prior to ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we believe that treaties and conventions should be tabled in the parliament with proper provision for debate. We would legislate to require that treaties are tabled with a provision for significant debate prior to ratification. Thirdly, we will establish a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments process&mdash;the COAG process. This initiative will be associated with a general strengthening of the consultative procedures on international law making between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly&mdash;I think this is the point the member for Tangney likes best&mdash;we will implement domestic legislation prior to ratification of treaties. We will work with the states to ensure that, where possible, domestic legislation is in place prior to that ratification. I agree with the member for Tangney. I think that will largely overcome many of the fundamental objections we have to the exclusion of the legislature from the whole treaty making process. I think it is true that that is a better initiative. It is one which we proposed long before the High Court ruled in the Teoh case. That is a better initiative than the initiative put forward in this piece of legislation. That is the view of the member for Tangney and I think he is right. So this legislation, which we are going to allow through, can be reconsidered once we have initiated our reforms&mdash;and this reform, as I have said, is a very important one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, we will establish a joint house treaties committee which will provide a detailed analysis of the implications of any prospective signing or ratification of an international treaty by Australia. Sixthly, we will give consideration to the issue of parliamentary ratification and, more specifically, we will refer to the constitutional convention&mdash;the people's convention that the coalition will establish in around 1997&mdash;the issue of the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to say to the House that I am not a great fan of amending or trying to amend the external affairs power, partly because I think it would be very difficult to find the right sort of wording. Secondly, there is just the practical political consideration. I doubt very much that you would succeed with such a referendum. The Labor Party would no doubt run one of its irresponsible and characteristic scare campaigns against any such proposal, so unless you really are confident of getting up constitutional reform proposals&mdash;I am a realist&mdash;I do not think there is much point in putting them forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this legislation is a start. Importantly, this legislation is a concession of the intellectual point. Let us face it. We have won the intellectual argument and now let us start moving towards implementing the coalition's treaty making reform proposals so that, having won the intellectual argument, we can have a proper treaty making process in this country. That will happen after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill illustrates the government's double standards towards the High Court. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that anyone who said that the Mabo decision of the High Court was anything less than perfect was branded as everything from a wrecker to a racist. Here we have the Teoh decision of the High Court which this government has branded as a form of judicial extremism. We have complete double standards. On the one hand, the Mabo decision is regarded as holy writ; on the other hand, the Teoh decision has been regarded as as disposable as an old Kleenex.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that High Court decisions are always worthy of respect. However, they are worthy of more respect to the extent that the High Court leaves law making to parliament and confines itself to the proper purview of the courts, namely, the interpretation of the law. There are two essential problems which are highlighted by this bill. The first is the hyper-adventurism of the High Court and the second is that the external affairs power in our constitution has grown like Frankenstein's monster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In opening this debate for the government, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) very rightly said that it was up to the government to make the law of the land. He is absolutely correct, but under our constitution state governments also make the law of the land. State governments must be allowed to make the law in their own appropriate spheres and the problem is that this government is no longer allowing state governments to go ahead and make law in the areas established by custom, convention and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we establish at the beginning of this debate two fundamental principles. The first fundamental principle is that under our system it is the parliament which makes the law and it is the courts which interpret the law. We must have the law being made by elected politicians and not by unelected judges, because if that is not the situation we are faced with the prospect of an imperial court&mdash;something that no fair-minded Australian would like to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fundamental principle is that the external affairs power, quite rightly and properly granted by our constitution to the Commonwealth government, exists to give Canberra the power to conduct foreign policy. It does not and should not exist to give Canberra the power to interfere in every nook and cranny of our national life. If you go back to the time of the Federation process and look at the debates that were held at that time, you will see that there was originally a proposal that what is now section 51(xxix) of our constitution should say that the Commonwealth should have power to make laws with respect to the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth for external affairs and treaties. That addition `and treaties' was specifically deleted from our constitution in the constitution drafting process. That is not because our founders believed that the Commonwealth government should lack the power to enter treaties but because they believed that this power should operate responsibly and not irresponsibly. In their belief it should never have been some kind of blank cheque for the Commonwealth to legislate willy-nilly for everything about which a foreign treaty could be signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Burgess's case the High Court held that to be a valid exercise of section 51(xxix) anything that was done under a treaty had to be indisputably international in character. In the submerged lands case the High Court upheld Commonwealth legislation dealing with the 200-mile limit on the basis that this was indisputably international. In the Koowarta case the High Court upheld racial discrimination legislation on the basis that ending racial discrimination was a valid international objective. But then in the Tasmanian dams case the High Court took a crucial step forward&mdash;some would argue a crucial step too far&mdash;when it said that section 51(xxix) gave the Commonwealth power to implement any aspect of a bona fide treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) say, Australia is party to something like 940 separate treaties dealing with just about every conceivable subject. The idea that the Commonwealth is empowered to make law on all of these subjects governed by these 940 treaties is to make a mockery of the ordinary operation of the Australian federal system. In the particular case dealt with by this bill, Teoh was a Malaysian who was convicted of heroin trafficking. The High Court agreed with the overturning of a deportation order against Mr Teoh on the basis of a UN convention providing that the rights of the child should be given primary consideration in considering the fate of a parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case illustrates the difficulties in trying to apply general principles to specific cases. It shows how easy it is for courts and, indeed, governments to look foolish when they try to apply the general law to a specific case. It also illustrates the extreme ingenuity of lawyers in using just about any legal weapon that comes to hand to try to make a point. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was designed to protect children, not to protect heroin traffickers. The fact that it has been used in this way shows the hyper-adventurism of the current High Court. Teoh is an illustration of the problem that this country faces with current forms of judicial interpretation and with the current use of the external affairs power. It is an illustration of the problem; it is not the problem itself. So this bill, which tries to reverse the difficulties created by the Teoh case, addresses the symptoms and not the disease. We need to slay Frankenstein's monster, not simply put him in a cage. We need to tackle the real problem that this case has highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, part of that is having a High Court which rediscovers more traditional principles of jurisprudence. That is out of the hands of this parliament, but this parliament can try to tackle this government's misuse of the foreign affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is designed to ensure that `entering into an international treaty is not reason for raising any expectation that government decision makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of the treaty have not been enacted into the domestic Australian law'. In other words, the government is trying to say, `Don't listen to what we say. Just look at what we do. Don't take anything we say seriously because it is our actions not our words that count.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What kind of hypocrisy is this? Surely the government should only sign a treaty if it intends to be bound by the provisions of that treaty. Surely there is no point in signing any treaty if we do not intend to be bound by that treaty. What is the point of giving our solemn word as a nation if, as soon as it is convenient to break that solemn word, we do so. In its conduct towards this particular treaty the government has echoed the conduct of the German government in 1914 when foreign minister Bethman Hollweg stood up and said that Germany's solemn guarantee of the neutrality of Belgium was nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. We all know the moral quality of the German government of 1914. I think it is absolutely tragic that the Australian government of 1995 is playing the same sorts of games with its solemnly pledged word. The word of the Australian government should count for something in the world. To sign a treaty, but only to adhere to the treaty when it suits this government, is to destroy any reputation for honour and integrity that our government should have. The simple thing is that our government should not sign these treaties if it does not intend to honour them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Teoh case is another illustration of the complete hypocrisy of this government: using treaties when its suits, ignoring them when it does not suit and abusing them at all times. Take, for instance, the International Labour Organisation conventions that this government has ratified. The government uses them when it suits them to attack state industrial relations laws, but when it does not suit them, the government ignores them. For instance, the ILO conventions that this government has ratified outlaw compulsory unionism. Is this government doing anything to abolish compulsory unionism? Of course not! This is another example of the completely hypocritical approach of this government to international treaties. The government spouts fidelity to convention when it suits them; otherwise they ignore these conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me stress this point: no government, let alone the Australian government, which presumably wants to act according to the highest principles of honour and integrity, should sign a treaty that it does not intend to uphold. The government should not selectively use treaties to extend Commonwealth power into every nook and cranny of our national life, because that is not upholding Australia's treaty obligations; that is subverting the spirit of our constitution under the guise of upholding treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has used foreign treaties to undermine the states. We all know that the states have suffered over the last 95 years. The states are not now what they once were. I am not standing here as a passionate advocate of states' rights; I am standing here as someone who believes in functioning federalism&mdash;that is to say, in a federal system where each sphere actually has something to do and where each sphere has some autonomy of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that through the uniform tax cases and through section 96 grants the states over the years have been reduced to the position of pensioners of the Commonwealth. The government's misuse of the foreign affairs power is virtually reducing them to tenants at will. But the government has gone further than that with its misuse of the foreign affairs power. Not only has it undermined the role of the states; it has undermined the sovereignty of Australia itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it changed the protocols governing our adherence to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, what it really did was give a foreign body&mdash;the United Nations Human Rights Committee&mdash;power over Australia that it will not now allow to a perfectly legitimate Australian body such as the Tasmanian parliament. Thanks to its misuse of the foreign affairs power, Australian people are subject to a committee of the United Nations in so far as that human rights committee, according to this government, could force the federal government to legislate to override Tasmania's criminal code. In other words this government, which claims to believe in the sovereignty of Australia and to be proudly Australian, prefers the judgments of a United Nations committee to the considered decision and the legislation of the Tasmanian parliament. We have to fix the problem, not put a bandaid on it, which is what this legislation is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I entirely support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), which was supported just a few moments ago by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). A treaties council is a very important part of reforming the  Australian governmental process. It is very important in a democracy such as Australia that treaties be not ratified without the full consideration not just of this parliament but of all the parliaments to which they might one day be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is important to go further than that. That is why one of the things that the constitutional convention of 1997 promised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) will do is consider this whole question of the scope of the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor George Winterton, someone with whom I do not always agree but who nevertheless is an eminent constitutional expert, has stated that it is possible to amend section 51(xxix) of the constitution in a way that the courts could make sense of. You can do it by providing essentially that section 51(xxix) will govern the relations of persons and things inside the Commonwealth with persons and things outside the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Winterton has endorsed the approach adopted in 1984 by Peter Durack, who framed a proposed constitutional amendment to the effect that a new section be inserted in section 51(xxix) after the words `external affairs' to provide that the power did not authorise laws with respect to persons, matters or things in the Commonwealth except to the extent that, firstly, those persons, matters or things have a substantial relationship to other countries or to persons, matters or things outside the Commonwealth and the enactment deals with, or with all matters affecting or arising out of, that relationship; or, secondly, the operation of the enactment is related to the movement of persons, matters or things into or out of the Commonwealth. That was the proposed constitutional amendment of former Senator Peter Durack. That amendment was endorsed, if not to its political desirability, at least to its legal feasibility by Professor George Winterton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another eminent constitutional expert, the former professor of law at Melbourne University, Dr Colin Howard, proposed his form of amending section 51(xxix). He proposed to add to section 51(xxix) after the words, `external affairs' these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"provided that no such law shall apply within the territory of a State unless</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">c)the law relates to the diplomatic representation of the Commonwealth in other countries or the diplomatic representation of other countries in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA>So it is possible to amend section 51(xxix) in a way to rein in this misuse of the Commonwealth's current foreign affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between a constitutional amendment designed to achieve this objective and just about every other constitutional amendment which has ever been put to the Australian people is that this constitutional amendment would be designed to rein in the power of Canberra, not to expand the power of Canberra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill overrules the recent High Court decision in the Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs versus Ah Hin Teoh&mdash;commonly known as the Teoh case&mdash;handed down on 7 April 1995. The explanatory memorandum states that the bill will restore the situation before that particular case, in which if there were to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from adherence to a treaty, they would be made by parliamentary and not executive action. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Teoh, the High Court decided that when the executive ratifies an international treaty, provided there are no statutory or executive indications to the contrary, a legitimate expectation is created that administrative decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>I read that from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> because I think it is very important to understand precisely what we are doing here, namely, interpreting the meaning of a treaty&mdash;a matter in which a decision should be made by a government. In this case the bill is being amended to provide for that parliamentary consideration as insisted on in the court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of sovereignty: do Australians have control over their own destiny? Does this parliament have control over its own sovereign rights? Further down the track, we will have to consider also the sovereign rights of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role that international treaties play in what we sometimes might consider the dilution of our sovereign rights means that the amendments we are proposing within this bill, moved by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), are worthy of consideration at this time of debate. The bill at least is a positive step in indicating that the Australian parliament, the Australian government and the people of Australia are masters of their own destiny in spite of what the treaty might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one case that has gone to the High Court. Consider all the other decisions that could be made by the executive in this country where they offend the treaties and the people have neither the right nor the power to take the case to the High Court for a decision. We are really looking at a minefield of unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that all these treaties we are talking about are not United Nations initiated, but it is very important to understand the procedures of the United Nations in the formulation of treaties. Last year I was the member of the 49th session of the UN, along with my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples). It really is an eye-opener and provides an understanding of how treaties are formulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably not far from the truth to say that, by the time a treaty comes to the light of day, there could have been two years of protracted and sometimes tortuous negotiations between the 184 nations within the United Nations making that decision. When it comes to such a decision as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, many of those 184 nations have fairly bad reputations themselves as far as their own human rights, yet they are part of this procedure. After it has gone through the procedure and been formulated, it is almost a matter of Australia saying, `It is a matter of political correctness that we have to sign and ratify that treaty.' Up to this stage, I believe we do not really realise what those implications have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 49th session of the United Nations I was involved in some of those discussions, and one treaty that came to fruition during that session was the Convention to Combat Desertification. You can look at that treaty on desertification and say that it was a noble treaty in that it was going to extend Australia's help to those countries overseas, particularly in North Africa where the desert has encroached over the centuries&mdash;for instance, only two per cent of the total land area of Egypt is now arable. You then realise that the treaty is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part is that it has been suggested that the desertification treaty could be used in Australia to overrule states rights and states sovereignty in connection with the land they possess because we have attached ourselves to the United Nations treaty. Far be it from me to say that I believe the intention was that it could only be limited in that sense to overcome the states rights if the Australian government itself proceeded to legislate in the terms of the desertification treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we find in this case is that a court has ruled that if you sign a treaty you are obliged to follow the treaty unless you legislate otherwise. As I say, that is a turnaround of what I thought was the procedure, but I think it is a very important application of what treaties mean. It is not as though we are unaware of the implications of treaties at this stage. I would suggest that all members have had concerns raised by constituents within their electorates over many years about the implications of this. I can recall there being heated debate within my electorate on the rights of the child convention as to what signing and all the other implications were of it. I used to say `Well, unless Australia legislates, we are not in any trouble.' So we see that there is a problem within this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also wanted to talk about some of the other High Court, or any court, decisions that concerned the external affairs power. The first one that I can recall where the external affairs powers was used by the Commonwealth was the Franklin Dam case. The decision on the Franklin Dam attached itself, by a majority of four to three, to the international decision that Australia did have the rights of external powers to go to the World Heritage body and say that it wanted to have the Franklin Dam listed, even though it was over the wishes of the state at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Franklin Dam case decided that the federal government had the power under external powers to intervene. I am not saying it was a right decision or a wrong decision but, since that time, the Franklin Dam decision has had implications for other High Court decisions. In the consequent Daintree forest decision, amongst others, the same judges who did not believe that Australia had the rights of external powers&mdash;those judges who dissented from the majority decision in the Franklin Dam case&mdash;said that, because the Franklin Dam decision was there, they would follow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the Daintree because the final decision was made by an international committee. I suggest that that international committee comprised many countries whose environmental performance was, to say the least, questionable. At the end of that decision the international body said that it would not proceed to declare World Heritage listing in any place where the state did not agree with the listing. That is the point I am making. The federal government used the external affairs power to override the rights of the state. The Daintree forest issue has now passed and the result is there for all to see. The application of international treaties does not just involve the question of whether Australians retain the sovereign right to do things; it also involves state sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to another matter, I believe the judges of the High Court acted out of their role in interpreting the law and actually initiating law. I refer to the Mabo case. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) talked about this subject but came to a different conclusion. I believe that the role of the High Court in that case in making a determination about Mabo and the continuing rights was correct, but when it went a step further and talked about compensation and other irrelevancies in connection with that decision, it overstepped its role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia do not realise that, having made that decision in Mabo, not only has this government of its own initiative legislated in the area of land rights to take the Mabo case as a basis but also it has introduced a law in Australia that does not really represent the Mabo decision. But the Commonwealth has a sovereign right to do that. It can legislate, and it has legislated. I believe the issue will be very contentious in the final run. The lawyers around the place will have to try to unwind some of the interpretations. I fear that when the interpretation goes back to the High Court we will get some rude awakenings. I do not agree with the member for Throsby. I believe the constitution sets out quite clearly and concisely what the High Court's obligations are in interpretation. It is not there to initiate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in the United States when the mid-term elections were held. The Republicans received an absolute majority in both houses. In their contract with America and in their lead-up to it, they confined themselves to very minimal arguments. One of the minimal arguments was America's attitude towards the United Nations and the retention of sovereignty within the Congress. The Republicans felt&mdash;I believe many Americans felt it by voting for the Republicans&mdash;that the American nation, with the greatest economy in the world, providing about 25 per cent of world GDP, was questioning whether they were being led by the nose through the United Nations. They fund and are one of the biggest supporters of the UN. They provide a considerable number of backup staff to the UN, and they were questioning their own future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was in the United States, the trade bill was brought back to the old parliament&mdash;that is, the one to renegotiate the GATT arrangements. After a lot of argument the old Congress put through the bill but with a caveat, and that was: if in one year's time the Congress felt that through being a member of the new World Trade Organisation they were losing the power to administer their own affairs, their own sovereign rights, they would back out of it. That is the condition that applies to GATT at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia acts holier than anyone else in the world when it comes to treaties and GATT arrangements. It is led by the highest principle and integrity. Australia was flying the GATT flag and pulling down tariff barriers, protection and so on in the face of world competition. Our farmers and our people who marketed on the world stage were facing the corruption of the European Community, the corruption of the American situation on subsidies and the corruption of the Japanese attitude towards protection. We stripped every last bit of protection and assistance from our people while the rest of the world laughed in our faces and maintained the subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia's attitude has to change. We have to fight fire with fire. We have to trade on an equal basis with those people overseas. I was very involved in that GATT arrangement because I knew the sugar industry was being led up the garden path. There was a $400 subsidy on a tonne of sugar in the European Community and our protection was at 15 per cent&mdash;currently it is $50 a tonne. We were stripping away our last protection in the face of what was happening in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One treaty I was particularly interested in when I was there was the renegotiation of the ban on weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. It was rather interesting to see the countries that held out against it&mdash;France, America, and Great Britain&mdash;because they had a pecuniary interest. We have seen what has happened as a result of that: France is now exploding their bombs around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take those three countries and add China, they are four of the five countries involved in the Security Council. If those four countries are on the Security Council, I believe their mandate, which was established nearly 50 years ago, should be questioned. Should they be guarding the security of the world? In other words, if France cannot play by the rules it should vacate its place on the Security Council. That is another attitude. At least the United States is rather honest. It will involve itself in the treaty process but, at all times, will not sign or ratify the agreements. It is a very important aspect that we need to look at, particularly when looking at the amendments that are being proposed in this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already suggested this legislation is as a result of a question from the courts about who makes the rules. At this stage, we would have to say that the United Nations is making the rules in accordance with the treaty. We should be looking very carefully not at this amendment but at a whole stack of other amendments. The fact is that it has not been tested before the High Court and the executive might be running into danger by proceeding in a direction other than what the High Court's interpretation would be. There have been major concerns amongst my Australian constituents who have warned us from time to time about a one-world government. They question who governs Australia. They want to know the unintended consequences of signing and ratifying a treaty. As I have said before, I believe there is a real minefield out there that has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that a signatory nation to a treaty, as Australia is, has to legislate to disclaim some of the provisions of that treaty. Perhaps that means we are coming into this at the wrong end. I certainly support the amendments that are being proposed. During the two-year process, with the fullest integrity and the belief they are doing the right thing, our people within the Australian mission in the United Nations have to go through this process of argument one against the other with the 184 nations. Maybe we should involve ourselves as a parliament, as the people of Australia, at an earlier stage. Therefore, instead of the United Nations being a combination of bureaucrats from around the world, we as a government and as a parliament could become very closely involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part in which we have to involve ourselves is not mentioned within the amendments&mdash;that is, the provision of external powers. I believe the founding fathers introduced external powers. We as a parliament, as well as this government, have abused those powers, unfortunately with the support of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second reading amendment condemns the government for its failure `to ensure that the parliament, the states and the wider community are given proper and timely involvement in international law making by the government'. I believe that is appropriate. I just question when we will begin that process of intervention. The amendment also condemns its failure `to legislate to require that treaties be tabled and debated in the parliament prior to ratification'. I suggest that be clarified to say that we can debate them, amend them and give an opinion that perhaps they should not proceed. I believe that process should be attached to every major treaty to which we are a signatory or which we are going to ratify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading amendment further condemns the government for its failure `to establish a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments in conjunction with a general strengthening of the consultative procedures of COAG' and its failure `to work with the states to ensure that, where possible, domestic legislation is in place prior to ratification of treaties'. I think that picks up the point that has been made here this morning that there are sovereign rights of the Commonwealth and sovereign rights of the states. These rights should be looked at in a constitutional way to ensure that we are not offending one or the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the amendment condemns the government for failing `to establish a joint treaties committee to provide a detailed analysis of the implications of any prospective signing or ratification of an international treaty by Australia'. There is a suggestion in the field that we should have citizens initiated referendums. Heaven forbid that we should ever take each treaty to such a referendum. But I believe a referendum is required to properly define our rights under external powers and our relationship with treaties. The power of signing and ratifying treaties to which Australia is a signatory belongs in this parliament, not in the hands of the executive, as this decision so clearly points out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in the consideration by the House of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995. This bill signals a breathtaking backdown by the federal government. It is an admission that the whole approach to the treaty making process is fundamentally flawed. The government has been widely condemned for its arrogance and high-handed approach to making international treaties. It has refused&mdash;and it still does refuse&mdash;to acknowledge that it owes any accountability whatsoever to the Australian people when it comes to signing treaties. It has refused to acknowledge the legitimate role that the Australian states have in the treaty making process, and it refuses to acknowledge the central role the federal parliament should play in the process of treaty ratification. This arrogance has caught up with this government. After playing with fire for so long, it has got its fingers burnt&mdash;and badly burnt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today illustrates the problems with the current treaty making process. This bill seeks to ensure that upon ratification of a treaty no legitimate expectations are created for the purposes of administrative law. The judgment in the Teoh case, which this bill seeks to overrule, found that ratification of a treaty was sufficient to create the legitimate expectation that the executive government and its agencies would act in accordance with the treaty provisions. In other words, if someone feels that a decision maker has acted in a manner contrary to the treaty, then that person has the right to bring a case against those who made that decision. The government has taken the correct course in this case in asking the parliament to overrule this judgment of the High Court. But the problem would not have arisen in the first place had this government's treaty making process and the practices surrounding that process not been so fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Labor Party treaties are entered into in so many cases without adequate knowledge of the impact they will have on Australians and their way of life. They are also entered into without the support of the Australian people, expressed either directly or indirectly through their elected representatives. And that is what democracy is all about: members of parliament representing their constituencies and their concerns in this place. With the way this treaty making process has evolved under this government, the people do not matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of this bill is a stark reminder that this government enters into treaties which it does not fully understand. This is a bill to protect the government from the unforeseen consequences of a treaty it has entered into recklessly. This is not the type of responsible decision making Australians want, nor expect, from a national government. This is why the coalition stresses the urgent need for an overhaul of Australia's treaty making process. This process must become more responsive to the views of the Australian people. In short, it must become more democratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most outrageous aspects of the government's conduct in this entire area is the use of international treaties to override the constitutional authority of the states. Through a perverse and dictatorial use of the external affairs powers, it has passed legislation in subject areas our federal constitution put under state jurisdiction. If evidence of this government's arrogance was ever needed, this is it. A fair and just treaty making process would respect the constitutional authority of the states and would ensure that the states were involved at the negotiating stages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other reasons why a fundamental rethink of the treaty making process is so urgently required. Treaties to which Australia is a signatory and which the government has ratified exert a considerable influence on the legal and constitutional system of this country. This is so whether or not those treaties have been implemented through domestic legislation. For instance, courts may look into treaties in order to help explain ambiguous statutes. This is because, as Justice Gummow said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the parliament should be taken as intending to legislate in conformity and not in conflict with international law.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to this, the High Court has stated that judges may look into international treaties where the common law is uncertain. In the Teoh case Chief Justice Mason and Justice Deane said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of an international convention to which Australia is a party, especially one which declares universal fundamental rights, may be used by the courts as a legitimate guide in developing common law.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the explanatory memorandum to this bill states that the bill will not change the role played by treaties in interpreting legislation or in developing common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has a fundamental problem with this. Treaties are having a major impact on our legal system&mdash;a system supposedly subject to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In a democratic system, the laws its citizens live under are supposed to be made, or at least sanctioned, by the citizens themselves. This is clearly not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems inherent in executive control of treaties were recognised as long ago as the French Revolution. Some wise sage concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the executive power does not have the right to make the simplest law, why would one give it the right to make treaties, the consequences of which are so important?</PARA>
<PARA>As long ago as the French Revolution there was concern about treaty making and what could be done for the citizens of the nation. I believe this side of the House concurs with those wise words, which were made two centuries ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government usually responds to such criticism by pointing out that no treaty can have full legal status in this country until it is legislated by the federal parliament. In one sense this is true. But this conveniently glosses over some important truths about ratified treaties. I have already mentioned one&mdash;that is, treaties, when ratified, have an important influence in interpreting legislation as well as in the development of common law. It is also the case that the obligation to implement the treaty is created upon ratification and not at the time of legislative implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A country's failure to implement a treaty is taken by the international community as a betrayal to abide by the guarantee given when the treaty was ratified. These obligations should not be created by executive whim and without prior consultation with the people's parliament. I include in the consultation process state and local governments. This Labor Party often overlooks and does not care about local government, the third sphere of government in this country. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you know that local government is that sphere of government closest to the people on the ground. It is the basis of our democracy, because democracy starts at the local level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obligations created by a ratified treaty place strong pressure on the federal parliament to implement the treaty. This is not satisfactory. Parliament should be free to decide on the merits of the treaty itself before ratification takes place. But, as the situation now stands, even if the parliament does not pass legislation implementing the treaty, Australia still remains bound by its provisions. This is why it is so necessary for parliament to have a prominent role at an early stage of the ratification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A world authority on international treaties has had this to say about the role of parliaments in treaty making:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Important treaties in a democracy are not exclusively a governmental affair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of their law-making effect and political bearing, they require legislative participation, and this the more so, the more the range of international agreements expands.</PARA>
<PARA>This authority went on to say that parliamentary influence should be as `meaningful as possible' and that this necessitates parliamentary involvement before the country has become irrevocably bound to a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of international treaties impacts directly on my shadow portfolio of local government. Last week I had the pleasure of attending the 99th annual conference of the Local Government Association of Queensland held in Bundaberg. The president of that association, Councillor Jim Pennell, referred to local government concerns about the impact of international treaties on local government and local communities. In his speech to that conference he referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the tendency of our Federal Government to lock into international treaties and agreements which impact on local Government and our communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These agreements are, in most cases, evolved by people we have never heard of, let alone elected to make decisions on our behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too great a reliance in this type of legislative procedure is a sure way to lose national identity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A concept still dear to the heart of many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>These remarks reflect increasing concern among local communities about the manner in which the Labor government is signing up to international treaties. These concerns by local government organisations are readily understandable. Local government anchors the Australian system of government at a community level. It is directly in touch with, and responsible for, many aspects of community life. It is the principal means by which local and regional communities express their identity, enhance their wellbeing and care for their environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity of local government to fulfil these roles is increasingly being undermined by Labor's fetish for international treaties and conventions. It is surely only commonsense that local problems are best resolved on a local basis. What expertise or knowledge or sympathy can a bureaucrat sitting somewhere in Geneva have on rural or outback Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of the problems international treaties can cause local government and rural communities is the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Desertification is nothing if it is not a local and regional issue. It can only be solved by people who work and live in the affected areas. It is insulting to those people who work and whose families have worked and lived in these areas for generations to propose that solutions to these problems be sent down from on high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the effects of international agreements on rural and remote Australia is the issue often floated by the Labor Party, and in particular by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and the former minister for the environment, relating to the Lake Eyre Basin. If the federal government were to sign over control of the Lake Eyre Basin and make it a world heritage listed area they would be handing over one-sixth of the land mass of this nation. The Lake Eyre Basin cuts across three states and the Northern Territory. The total area that is subject to discussion now is some 1.2 million square kilometres. </PARA>

Putting it under federal control will destroy those private land-holders who live out there. I had the opportunity to visit part of this area of Australia only two weeks ago.

They certainly have not heard the last from me or from members who represent this part of Australia if they think they can put this area up for World Heritage listing. What the federal government ought to do is go out there and have a look at the area before they consider the issue any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue I would like to touch on very quickly is that of how governments, when they do nominate areas for World Heritage listing, can impact on the rate revenue of a local government. When land is locked up into these areas, it is no longer rateable land. A national park was created in a remote part of my own electorate in Queensland. When that area was listed as a national park, because it was no longer rateable land, the local council lost 17 per cent of its rate revenue from its local rate source&mdash;a consideration never taken into account by the state government when it made that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit me to speak at any greater length on this bill, but I hope that the federal government listens to the coalition's amendments, considers them and supports them.

Administrative law is concerned with the legal means by which decisions by government and associated entities can be challenged.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a federal member from the state of Tasmania, which in the last decade has been the butt and borne the brunt of this Labor government signing international treaties, it gives me great delight to enter into this debate today. The debate has gone full circle. The government wanted to get into debating and signing international treaties. I will go through a list of those treaties later. In 1983 the federal government wanted to intervene in Tasmania and so extended the interpretation of the external affairs power. The federal Labor Party, after riding roughshod over democratically elected state governments in this country and entering into international treaty agreements, is now being caught out and is saying, `We enter into these agreements but they are not meant to mean anything.'</PARA>

There is a full list of coalition members in here debating this issue, but there are only two Labor Party members in the parliament. Why is that the case? They do not want this issue debated. They do not want to be seen to lack openness or honesty in the treaties they have been signing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to a few details on the numbers of treaties and conventions that Australia has signed. A survey of international treaties and conventions has found that Australia is now a party to or has signed or is affected by 2,238 treaties. Hardly any of these have been debated by the Australian people. Once we had a constitution which was very clear that international treaties would not affect domestic Australian circumstances. When we formed this country in 1901 we had a concept of what was domestic and what was international. The present Labor administration of this country expanded that so that it could sign international treaties and then selectively use them in domestic political situations. Whether it was to do with the environment, whether it was to do with criminal law or whether it was to do with land use in desertification did not matter. The Labor Party wanted to have another way of undermining the constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. So they used the expansion of interpretation by the High Court in 1983 in the dams case to expand their federal powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just looking at the last three or four years we find  that in 1990 the number of treaties increased by 48; in 1991 by 50; in 1992 by 42; in 1993 by 44; and until 5 December 1994 by 36. There are 220 international treaties. How many of them were debated by the Australian people or were debated in this House? Hardly any, if any. In this country now is an executive, a group of people, who can say, `Yes, we will enter into an international treaty and create obligations.' But this case illustrates the point that when the government gets caught out it wants to walk away from those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is about openness by the Australian parliament to the international community, to the state governments of Australia and to the Australian people. Are we going to be part of the international community and stand by our word when we sign and ratify treaties or not? That is the first test of openness. I think we should. We now have a tangled mess in Australia created by the federal Labor Party in regard to international treaties and our constitution and the role of states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to make sure that before we sign international treaties, and before we make obligations to other people in our global community, we are certain that we have debated the issues and changed the legislation in the Australian parliament and in the state parliaments. We can then stand up proudly as a nation and say, `We mean it and we stand by it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last four years this government has signed about 220 treaties. However, when a treaty does not suit the government it walks away from it. If it suits the government politically it will take action. Let me illustrate a couple of examples. The bill relating to human rights and sexual conduct passed through the House last year. This was an attempt to stifle the Tasmanian criminal code. It has had no effect, and it will probably never have any effect because no-one has ever been charged with these sorts of things anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It suited the government to try to create difficulties in the Australian situation&mdash;particularly in Tasmania&mdash;and for political purposes the government used an international treaty obligation to take action and legislate in Australia. In doing so, the government took notice of various countries which have absolutely atrocious records on human rights. However, that is what the Labor Party would do. The Labor Party will listen to committees of the United Nations in Geneva or in New York. Some of the people on those committees come from countries where, if there is a problem for the government, people are lined up against a wall and shot. The Labor Party takes notice of a committee made up of those people, but it will not take notice of a state government which has a legitimate right to have a criminal code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to the debate about the rights of the child. We have the UNICEF convention of 1994. This government was told that it was out of kilter with the convention in caning children in schools. The Attorney-General was warned about it. He was told, `You are not abiding by the international agreement. The international agreement says that you should not be using the cane.' The international committee is saying that this is violence against children. I must put it on record that I think some of these things are over the top. There is a position for sensible discipline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did the federal Labor government and Minister Lavarch handle this complaint from the international community? This time the Attorney-General said, `No, we are not going to apply this one. We are not going to take any notice of it.' When there was a convention in relation to homosexuality and the right of people to practise sodomy, the Attorney-General said, `Yes, we will legislate for that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is fickle. All it does is enter into international agreements without debating them on the floor of this House and without alerting state governments to the treaties that it is entering into. When it suits the government it brings in legislation and says, `We have obligations overseas. We have listened to the United Nations committee.' The government listens to those committees regardless of whether they are made up of representatives from countries who have no regard for human rights and children's rights. At other times the government says, `Oh well, we will leave it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two or three government members have entered into this debate today. They are running scared on this issue. They are running into problems. The government is coming to the end of their term. They have lots of problems around the country. This one comes out of immigration. There is a whole set of complexities. We have this legislation in here today because the government did not get it right before they entered into an international treaty. They did not get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to enter into international treaties&mdash;I believe that there are a number of them which we should be entering into, and which we will enter into in the future&mdash;let us debate the issues in this great country of ours first, not second or third after a UN committee and the UN. Let us debate the issues in this country. Let us be vigorous about it. When we enter into international treaties, let us say that we will stand by our word on the international platforms because we signed and ratified a treaty and because we meant what we signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here in the parliament today we are seeing a government that is being duplicitous. It is a supreme irony. Some people say that you cannot have your cake and eat it too. That is what has been going on with the federal Labor Party with regard to international treaties for 10 or 12 years. It has now been caught out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has to make sure that in the future a due process is put in place whereby we can debate the issues, the people are consulted and the issues are analysed thoroughly. Let us not have government members come in here and talk of the unintended consequences of signing international treaties. Let us debate the issue thoroughly before so that we do understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country now needs a much more sophisticated process whereby we enter into international treaties. If out of this legislation and debate in the parliament today Australia takes a new approach to entering into these treaties, it will be a worthwhile debate. But, if it means that we are going to pass legislation which allows governments to say that they will still sign treaties when they like without the consultation of this parliament, state parliaments or the Australian people and create obligations and then use them selectively for political purposes whenever they want to, we have it wrong. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, there is a need for us to clarify very clearly what we are about with regard to international obligations and how we will run the internal domestic affairs of this country when we enter into international treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is very up-front about this. I am sure that the Australian people are delighted to hear about the openness with which the coalition has debated this issue. We are saying to the Australian people that we will make sure that if we enter into treaties in the future there will be due process and domestic legislation in Australia before we sign internationally. That is the way that it should happen. We should not have this duplicitous process that the Labor Party has instituted in this country for the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will work with the states. We will talk with the state members of parliament. We will discuss the issues that internationally will affect them domestically in this country before we sign the treaties. We need a treaties council to debate them. We will have a people's convention to talk over these types of issues and get them sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great tragedy that this country has gone through constitutional confusion in this area for 12 years when, as soon as the 1983 dams case decision had been brought down, any open, honest, genuine government would have made sure that the process of signing, debating and developing commitments internationally would have been formalised in a much more open, up-front manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to speak today with my colleagues on these international treaties and what the government has done in this Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill. At the beginning of my speech, I would like to remark on the absolute absence, save for one person, of any member of the Australian Labor Party in the chamber. They cannot support this legislation because, on examination, it is a process which will lead to the absolute concentration of power in Canberra and will permit the existence of the states only with the compliance of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 2,200 treaties have been signed. The Commonwealth government now knows that those treaties apply to all laws in Australia. Who can predict to which laws certain treaties apply? It will take individuals around Australia, and maybe the government itself, to determine which laws are overridden by these international treaties already signed by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the federal government, on the formula it has adopted today, decides that a treaty will not apply to particular legislation, it will be the government here in Canberra which decides that that treaty will not apply and will excise the particular domestic law from the application of a treaty. That will be the exercise of absolute power, because it will allow the federal government to decide which international treaty shall apply, if it is in the federal government's favour, or which international treaty will not apply, if it is not in the federal government's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict that, if the Australian Labor Party are allowed to continue on their current course, within a period of 10 years the states will realise that there is no need for them to exist. In fact, all power will be exercised from Canberra and that absolute exercise of power will allow the states only to exist, only to operate, only to perform duties if the Commonwealth agrees to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody from the Labor Party will answer the proposition I am putting, maybe because they want to see the states go out of existence. But they may also wish not to enter the debate at this stage and take the process by secrecy forward to a point where the states will only exist with the compliance of the federal government. Gone are the days of cooperative federalism; they are finished with this decision and the government's reaction to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues from this side have generally been putting the proposition that, where the Australian government on behalf of the Australian people signs an international treaty, the onus is on the federal government to ascertain before signing that treaty what the impact will be in Australia once we have signed that treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has rejected that approach and has said, `No, we won't investigate things in Australia beforehand. We will, for instance, sign a treaty on the environment and apply it to Tasmania or to the Barrier Reef or any other part of Australia that takes our whim. But, if somebody else wishes to apply the treaty to an area that is of concern to them, we will not permit it unless it happens to be an objective of the federal government. We will legislate against that process if needs be.' So I see here one of the greatest concentrations of power in Canberra that has ever occurred. It is far more significant than the dams decision or any other decision of the High Court. The federal government's response to the decision in the Teoh case is to pick and choose whether or not treaties apply to any law or any group of individuals, any land mass, any area in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just remind the parliament and the people of Australia what has occurred in the process of the exercise of the foreign affairs powers of the federal government. We go back to the days of those early treaties, when the federal government and the Australian Labor Party said, `The international treaties do apply to Australia and they do apply to Tasmania, and in the dams case we are going to extend the federal powers.' The High Court found in favour of the federal government in that instance. `Ah,' said Senator Evans at that time, when he sent the bombing raids over Tasmania. Do you remember the F111s doing the strike down there? They flew secretly over Tasmania, and suddenly we have missions secretly being flown against our colleagues in Australia by the federal government. I cannot believe that that actually occurred in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did indeed, but in this day and age it brings to mind thoughts of actions in Yugoslavia and Bosnia where missions are flown against one state within a nation. That was deplorable. Senator Evans became known as Biggles, the great architect of our international relations, that great international poseur. What he was saying at that time was, `Don't worry about these treaties. They will only apply in Australia if they are attached to a bill and that bill recognises the fact that there is an international treaty. We can sign rafts of these things. We can sign them all day and all night.' The House will remember that at the end of last year 36 treaties lobbed onto our desks, signed in secret during the year by the federal government and lobbed onto this table&mdash;`We have signed these. Australians, cop this. We have signed 36 treaties, you do not know what is in them, we are not going to tell you about them, we are not going to debate it in the parliament, and it is not going to be published by anybody or in any instance.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done that 2,200 times and Senator Evans has consistently claimed, as has his successor, the Attorney-General and member for Dickson (Mr Lavarch), on many occasions, `There is no application of this international law. You are scaremongering if you say that is the case. There is no application of this international law to the domestic laws of Australia unless the legislation says the powers of this legislation, the powers used by the government to pass this legislation, rest in an international treaty.' The High Court says that is rubbish and those powers that are in the federal government are exercised, if a treaty is signed, whether or not the legislation actually says so. The High Court found that in the Teoh case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just draw to the attention of the House the fact that these matters have been before the House on many occasions. I have here a report of the Human Rights Commission of 15 or 20 years ago, pointing out the implication of international law in the Federal Court and relying on treaties to extend the rights of migrants, who most people would consider illegal migrants, to gain a claim on Australia. The Human Rights Commission advocated this very process that we see the High Court upholding now in the current Teoh case&mdash;another immigration case. Surprise, surprise! That has been at the forefront of people knocking back the constitutional rights outlined in the Australian constitution and instead relying on international law to put forward claims for people to remain in Australia. But the extension of this argument that the House is now debating is that the federal government will choose which of the 2,200 treaties will apply and where they will apply in Australia and where they will not. </PARA>

That will give the government the chance of applying or not applying those treaties that they have agreed to ratify, at whim. They have the opportunity of playing favourites. Think of the opportunities which the federal government has to play favourites with community groups.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the government not play favourites? They have the power to declare anything they like over that land. To declare or not declare, that is the power that the High Court says this government has. The absolute exercise of power by the federal government is curious when one refers to some of the statements made by Senator Evans and Mr Lavarch in regard to the Teoh case. They stated on behalf of the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that entering into an international treaty is not reason for raising any expectation that government decision-makers will act in accordance with the treaty if the relevant provisions of the treaty have not been enacted into domestic Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA>Deny that you said it, Attorney. Deny that you said those things about this legislation and what you predicted would be the application of international treaties in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a joint statement with that great guru of internationalism, Senator Evans, who is strutting the stage, claiming that all knowledge and understanding of international law abides in him alone. He has been proved absolutely wrong. The joint statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not legitimate, for the purpose of applying Australian law, to expect that the provisions of a treaty not incorporated by legislation should be applied by decision-makers. Any expectation that may arise does not provide a ground of review of a decision. This is so, both for existing treaties and for future treaties that Australia may join.</PARA>
<PARA>Note that the federal government reserves for itself the right to sign any treaty it wishes, to bind Australia hand and foot by deciding in secret and at whim which sections of the treaty it will apply or not apply. This is a complete denial of the whole democratic process. Why can these matters not be discussed, debated and brought into the House instead of being dealt with in secret by this government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's attitudes to treaties is quite open and quite different. I would contend that for the survival of a rational, cooperative federalism in Australia it is essential that we take this course. I believe this is one of the great issues facing Australia today: whether or not the Australian people want secret decisions to bind them in their homes, in their neighbourhoods and in their communities. They are not used to secret decisions binding them; they are used to a participatory democracy where they can have a say, where they have a right to contest the ideas and proposals that are being put forward by those who are elected. This process does not allow any of that to occur whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition approach to treaties is to properly consider the domestic arrangements before any treaty is signed. Why would you not have a conference to see if your attitudes to child care and care of children in the home and in the community were consistent with international requirements&mdash;before signing a treaty binding your people to a code of behaviour that they had not even understood or been asked to comment on?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995 is quite a short bill on a topic of major significance. Perhaps the government could have paraphrased the significance of the bill by telling the Australian people that the bill seeks to tell the unelected and unaccountable politicians on the High Court to butt out of law making and to get back to their role of interpreting the laws of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as has been indicated by prior speakers, the legislation before the chamber today seeks to overturn the effect of the Teoh case. On 7 April 1995, the High Court brought down its decision in the case of the Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Ah Hin Teoh. The Teoh case exploded the myth that everyone had previously thought to be the case&mdash;that is, that international treaties did not have a substantial effect in domestic law until such time as the parliament of this nation saw fit to incorporate the terms of that treaty into domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Teoh case, the High Court held that the ratification of a treaty by Australia creates a legitimate expectation that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the treaty provisions, even if they have not been legislated into Australian law. It also went on to say that, if it is proposed to make a decision inconsistent with that legitimate expectation, procedural fairness requires that the person affected be given notice and an adequate opportunity to reply. The High Court held that the legitimate expectation will not arise if there is either a statutory or executive act amounting to a contrary indication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the handing down of the decision, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who is in the chamber, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) issued a joint declaration, in effect seeking to negate any legitimate expectation which might otherwise have been seen to arise as the result of ratifying an international treaty. In their declaration, the two ministers also said that they would bring in legislation, such as that currently before the House, which would in effect further reinforce the terms of their particular statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the circumstances of the case of Teoh. Mr Ah Hin Teoh was a Malaysian citizen who was convicted in 1990 of six counts of importing heroin and three counts of being in possession of heroin&mdash;very serious offences. If the Australian people were asked whether someone convicted of those offences who was not an Australian citizen should be allowed to remain here, most people would say that&mdash;given the fact that every year a million people knock on the door seeking to migrate to Australia&mdash;persons of such poor character as Mr Teoh really ought not be allowed to remain. Most people would suggest that Australia can afford to pick and choose. They would say that we ought not take the dregs of society&mdash;such as Mr Teoh clearly is&mdash;as permanent residents of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Teoh had seven children dependent on him. A number of those were not his. One of them was a child of his wife's first marriage, three were children of Mrs Teoh's relationship with Mr Teoh's brother, and Mr and Mrs Teoh together had three children. During the prison sentence served by Mr Teoh and the subsequent sentence served by Mrs Teoh as a result of offences she had committed, the children were placed in the care of the state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Teoh had applied for permanent residency prior to his arrest&mdash;Australia being a very desirable place in which to live. But it was decided, quite reasonably in my view, that Mr Teoh did not come within the policy requirement of an applicant for permanent residence having to be of good character. Consequently, the delegate of the minister for immigration refused to grant Mr Teoh resident status under section 6A(l) of the Migration Act 1958 because he simply did not come within the provisions of that section. Mr Teoh appealed the decision, the Immigration Review Tribunal recommended that the decision of the delegate was correct and a deportation order was consequently issued against Mr Teoh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An obvious consequence of his deportation would have been either the break-up of his family unit, with the seven children dependent on Mr Teoh being separated from him, as would be his wife, or those eight people would have been compelled to leave Australia with him. The Immigration Review Tribunal weighed up all of the considerations and decided, on balance, that the compassionate claims were not considered to be compelling enough for the waiver of policy in view of Mr Teoh's criminal record. As a person who is a former chairman of a community corrections or parole board, I believe that, given the fact that we have so many people who want to come and live in Australia, people who are not permanent residents and who are not Australian citizens and who are convicted of very serious offences ought to be deported following the serving of their sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, Teoh was unsuccessful. However, the High Court brought down a decision which obviously was very satisfying from his point of view. That decision meant that the bureaucracy had to take into account the interests of the children because of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child which Australia had entered into in 1990. The government has now sought to reassure the Australian people by bringing this legislation into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been between 900 and 2,000 international treaties entered into and the problem now confronting the chamber indicates that the government really cannot have it both ways. The government cannot continue to sign these treaties willy-nilly, without reference to the Australian people, and without having to take into account that, with the increasing influence of international law in Australia, it could well be called to account for the treaties it is signing and ratifying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has indicated that international law will continue to be a very important influence in Australia. It was interesting to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> this morning where the former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Anthony Mason, backed the decision of the Teoh case and suggested to the government that this legislation was not effective. Page 7 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> has a report, under the headline `Mason backs defiant court', which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Courts would continue incorporating international law as part of the Australian common law, irrespective of interventions by the Federal Government, former High Court chief justice Sir Anthony Mason said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>He defended the High Court's decision that, as a result of entering into a treaty, `legitimate expectations' could be created that bureaucrats would take the terms of the treaty into account when making decisions affecting people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former High Court chief justice pointed out that this particular legislation might not be effective as it only dealt with the effect on the executive government and did not refer to judicial action, and certainly did not affect the courts. He pointed out that the concern was how a national court would respond when confronted with a rule formulated by an international convention to which Australia had acceded. This is a very recent statement by Sir Anthony Mason who was on the Sunshine Coast only yesterday opening the second national conference of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been warning for a very long time about the danger of entering into treaties willy-nilly. I think successive governments in Australia have looked at our nation's fairly proud human rights record, when these treaties have been signed, and in effect they say that the treaties are clearly designed to improve the performance of other parts of the world. But these governments' actions in entering into these treaties are coming back to bite them because the government is now being held to account. The High Court has pointed out that, while the terms of an international treaty are not actually incorporated into domestic law, the bureaucrats still have to take into account their provisions when making decisions. This legislation, which we are supporting as a coalition, in effect tells the High Court to butt out, tells the High Court that, at least in relation to the Teoh case, it has overstepped the mark. We are certainly not in agreement with the High Court giving to an international treaty the level of recognition in Australian law that the Teoh decision does prior to the Australian parliament passing legislation to implement it into our domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a major problem in recent years. The external affairs power in section 51 of the Australian constitution has been used by the Commonwealth government in effect to tear up the constitution on many occasions. The High Court has given the Commonwealth the legislative competence to implement any treaty into domestic law, whether or not under our Australian constitution the matters subject to that treaty are normally matters within the area of responsibility of the Commonwealth. That is a matter about which we are very concerned, and that is why I am very pleased to be supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), which seeks to put into effect a very much better treaty making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has been discussed here in Australia. Many of the provisions of that treaty one could not object to, but there have been concerns that the rights of parents have been disadvantaged as a result of the provisions of this particular convention. For instance, parents are not able to stop their children from joining a religious cult, parents are not allowed to inquire about prescribed medication that children are taking and children have the right to ban parents from their bedrooms. So there are a lot of concerns about the particular convention. However, this convention now is having an effect in Australia much beyond the intention of the government at the time it entered into this convention relating to the rights of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have major problems also on how Australia withdraws from treaties which no longer represent the community values of this nation. I have asked a series of questions of the government and they have not all been answered as yet. But it seems to me that, when a treaty does not have a provision for denunciation, does not have a provision for withdrawal or where one is not able to imply a right to withdraw from a treaty, the only way that we as a nation are able to withdraw from such a treaty is by going back to all of the signatories of that treaty and negotiating our exit from it. I must say, given the fact that we have signed somewhere between 900 and 2,000 treaties, though many of the treaties are commonsense treaties relating to important matters, that we are in effect signing away our sovereignty when we are entering into treaties from which we are not able to escape. Many of them, of course, we would not want to escape from, but as a nation we really ought to have the right to withdraw from treaties which no longer represent our collective values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has made it very clear that our approach to treaty making will be quite different from that of the government, and we have consistently pointed out that the government's approach is flawed. It has taken the decision in the Teoh case for the government to realise, as the rest of Australia has done, that there is something wrong with signing treaties which you do not intend to implement. As a coalition, we believe that it is very important to ensure that the Australian public, the states and the wider community are given proper and timely involvement in international law making by Australian governments, including, where appropriate, cost-benefit analyses in terms of Australia's national interests prior to any ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In government, we will legislate to require that treaties be tabled, with provision for debate, in the federal parliament prior to ratification. We will also establish a treaties council, as part of the Council of Australian Governments, and this initiative will be associated with a general strengthening of the consultative procedures. We will work with the states to ensure that, where possible, domestic legislation is in place prior to the ratification of treaties. We will also establish a joint house treaties committee to provide a detailed analysis of the implications of any prospective signing or ratification of an international treaty by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important pledge that we have made is that we will refer to the people's convention the question as to whether there ought to be a change to the Australian constitution to prevent the continued abuse&mdash;by Commonwealth governments, of whatever political colour&mdash;of the terms of the external affairs power in the constitution. So what we are going to do is consult with the Australian people to see whether a solution to this problem, which was not of the making of the Australian people, should be put to the Australian people through a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, of course, has brought this legislation into the parliament. There has been much criticism of this legislation from a number of people whose opinions the government would normally respect. We have the former Mr Justice Mason, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> today, pointing out that this legislation is flawed. It is clear that, at the very least, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) really should look at the comments of such an eminent lawyer as Sir Anthony Mason to see whether what he claims is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Possibly, the government should bring amendments to this legislation into the chamber to make sure that the bill we are discussing today will achieve its announced aims. There have been criticisms by Mr Justice Kirby, and there have been criticisms by Sir Ronald Wilson, the chairman of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There have also been criticisms by Justice Evatt. So there are a great number of critics lining up against this government. The legislation may well be flawed and it may well be not effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not do anything to redress the very major problem we have: between 900 and 2,000 treaties have been entered into and now have varying influences on Australian law. What we need to do, as a nation, is move to the approach suggested by the coalition and, in fact, incorporated by the honourable member for Berowra in the amendment he moved in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. The government members cannot on the one hand say that it is in order to sign treaties willy-nilly, to give themselves a nice warm inner glow by being able to strut the international stage and by being able to be seen to be doing all the sorts of things that other nations want us to do, and then on the other hand expect all of that signing not to have any effect on our domestic law. We now have a problem with the constitutional balance between the states and the Commonwealth, and we also have the very major problem that so many treaties are being entered into without reference to, or the consent of, the Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many nations overseas have other ways of dealing with international treaties. For instance, in the United States a treaty is not able to be ratified until the Senate of the United States consents to it. But one major difficulty here in Australia is that international treaties can be entered into and ratified by the executive without reference to the cabinet. One would think that, at the very least, the full cabinet&mdash;if not the parliament&mdash;should have some input into deciding what is going to be a treaty which is going to bind the Australian people, particularly as it seems that, in many cases, it is not possible to withdraw from those treaties unless one is prepared to negotiate with the other 120 or 130 signatories to those treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Brennan, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, has now questioned whether Australia should sign international treaties without full cabinet approval. The particular treaty which gave rise to the Teoh case was one which, I understand, was not referred to the cabinet. The full cabinet did not know about that particular treaty prior to its being signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 28 July 1995, Professor Cheryl Saunders is reported as saying that less than one-quarter of international agreements are subjected to Australian cabinet approval before being officially signed and ratified. That is a major problem. Not only are the Australian people not consulted, not only is the Australian parliament not consulted, but it seems that the Australian cabinet is not consulted either. If we have a minister who is hell-bent on signing an international treaty, then if he or she is able to persuade the Governor-General, through the Executive Council, to sign that international treaty on Australia's behalf, Australia could be bound by it without the consent of the parliament, without the consent of the people, and without the consent of the cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Attorney would be concerned about this matter as well. I think that the Attorney ought to explain to the House how this situation is acceptable, where less than one-quarter of international agreements are discussed by the cabinet prior to their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this is an instance where it has been proven that the government cannot have its cake and eat it too. The government has told us that international treaties are of no effect until they are legislated into domestic law whereas the High Court has said otherwise, and the former Chief Justice of Australia has, in effect, said that the High Court will continue to say otherwise. We have a major problem here. Here we have a situation where the High Court wants to move in one direction, but without the consent of the legislature. It is very important that the rights be restored to the legislature. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to sum up this particular debate. It is the second opportunity that the House has had in the last year or so to have a very fulsome debate on the question of Australia's involvement in international obligations. The previous occasion was the passage through this House of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill which passed through the House last year. Both during that debate and this particular debate today we have had the same sorts of outpourings of various degrees of xenophobia and hysteria and misinformation and probably genuine misunderstanding by particular opposition members about Australia's involvement in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for this discussion is to understand that Australia's founders gave to Australia when it federated, in the constitution, a particular power to speak for all Australians, and for all parliaments and governments of Australia, in international forums. That makes a fair bit of sense because one of the very purposes of federating to become one nation is so that internationally you speak with one voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undertone in all of this&mdash;that this has come out of the woodwork in recent years, that it was discovered by the High Court in the Tasmanian dams case back in 1983 and it is all a matter of recent invention&mdash;is absolute nonsense. The reality is that our national parliament has had power given to it by the Australian constitution in relation to external affairs and in relation to the executive, by section 61 of the constitution, to enter into executive action in relation to our international obligations. So this argument that it is all very recent and what have you has to be put to one side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next line of argument is, `All right, it is in the constitution but it was never intended that the external affairs power be used in the way that the High Court has suddenly discovered it in 1983.' But those members who are of that particular opinion might in their browsing in their local law library have a look at the decision in the Burgess case, a High Court decision in 1936. That set out very clearly at that time the very principles which the High Court largely has followed and developed in the many decades since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case it was made perfectly clear by the court that the Commonwealth parliament does have the power to enact laws based on Australia's international obligations. Again, it is a necessary incident of Australia being one country and the national parliament speaking internationally for the Australian people. So the contrary argument that is being put is a load of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next line of argument is that&mdash;shock! horror!&mdash;the High Court is actually having some regard to international law and international conventions in developing its approach to Australian common law. I find this rather odd. Is not the essence of Australian common law the doctrine of precedent? Is it not the principle of comity of the common law whereby, for many decades, the decisions of English judges, the Privy Council and the House of Lords had great influence in shaping the development of the law in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did we react with shock and horror at the thought of this? Did we find it terrible that the common law decisions of courts and judges in New Zealand or in Canada&mdash;a whole range of common law countries&mdash;had some influence on Australian law? Why do we suddenly find it shocking? We should not be startled by it because, again, it is not a recent invention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has, probably since its inception, taken approaches in developing the Australian common law, in interpreting an ambiguous provision in a statute, of taking an interpretation which is consistent with doctrines of international law, with international standards, rather than one which is inconsistent with it. There is no shock or horror in that. It is commonsense. This bill before the parliament in no way detracts from the capacity of the High Court or Australian courts to have regard to international influences in developing the Australian common law or as an aid to interpreting Australian statutes. So let us again put that to one side. It does not bear up under scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next line of argument put forward is that this is all done in secret. They are saying that Commonwealth officials or Commonwealth ministers are scurrying around the world secretly signing up the country and no-one knows about it&mdash;the parliament is not told about it and the Australian people are kept in the dark, and then all of a sudden they discover that their sovereignty has been eroded away! That is the sort of emotive nonsense you hear from members of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the circumstance is vastly different. When people are talking about treaties in this debate, I suppose they have in mind multilateral treaties; that is, the sorts of agreements which are reached by Australia in large international forums such as the United Nations. However, treaties take many varied forms. The closer economic relationship with New Zealand is an international treaty. Australia's involvement in the Bougainville peace arrangements is an international treaty or agreement between Australia and Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core of international obligations which Australia is a part of are just part and parcel of everyday life. We could not make an international telephone call, post a letter overseas, allow a plane from any part of the world to fly to Australia, have control of shipping into Australian ports and Australian waters, or have communications between this country and other parts of the world if we did not enter into proper arrangements and agreements to allow such services and communications to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the opposition are not startled by that, but what really seems to get their blood up in terms of these particular matters is the area of human rights and, to a lesser extent, or depending on the flavour of the month, the environment. It is human rights and environmental matters which really stir up the blood of the opposition. When it comes down to it, when they rail against international treaties, you can really narrow it down. They are railing against multilateral&mdash;as opposed to bilateral&mdash;treaties which deal with the subjects of human rights and the environment. That is really what gets the blood up for the members of the opposition. Then they say, `You shouldn't be going down this path and signing human rights treaties in secret so no-one knows about them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this debate is based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we should, I suppose, have a little bit of regard to the history of that convention. Was it signed without anyone knowing about it? Had people never heard of this rights of the child convention? It suddenly appeared: the states had never heard of it, the parliament had never heard of it, and no-one outside of government circles had ever heard of it!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that it took so long for this country to decide to agree to that convention was a direct result of the process of very carefully, with each state and territory in this country, going through the child welfare laws and the various juvenile justice laws&mdash;and anything which touched on this area&mdash;and making a determination as to whether Australian law as it stood, at the federal, state and territory levels, was consistent with the obligation that we were proposing that Australia was going to undertake internationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that. So the premise that the Australian government signs these things and then ignores the things, or is indifferent as to whether our domestic laws are in regard to the international treaty or not, is an absolute nonsense. We signed up on the thing and agreed to ratify it only after we came to the conclusion&mdash;reached after most extensive consultations with state governments in this country&mdash;that our laws were in fact consistent with the obligations we were undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, things can change. Circumstances can evolve, and we may find that our laws do not maintain their relevance to the international obligation. The example I started off with in terms of the debate last year is the process which I believe should then be followed. In relation to that circumstance, it involved the criminal laws of Tasmania being considered as inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What occurred there puts the lie to the basis of the argument which is often run in these debates. The government, having accepted that that was so, proposed legislation&mdash;debated by both chambers of the Australian parliament&mdash;in order to put forward a law which did bring us into line with the obligation that we took. I would have thought that was a fairly strong example of where Australia does not ignore its obligations under these conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government finds or believes that our laws are inconsistent with them, and makes a sovereign choice that it believes that that conclusion is good for this country, it then proposes a law to this parliament. This parliament is then asked to enact a law which has direct domestic impact so that the body of Australian law is brought into line with our international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we are enacting this particular legislation is that we do not agree with the decision which the High Court has taken in its judgment in the Teoh case. We disagree not so much in relation to the facts of Mr Teoh's case, though one would have views as to the appropriateness of the outcome in that case, but on the principle which the High Court expanded. By doing that, it extended the law beyond what the government&mdash;and, I think, the parliament&mdash;understood, and what was generally understood, to be the case when Australia signed up to that particular convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we then had two choices. We could have said, `Well, okay, we think that is right and we should take some legislative action in order to incorporate parts of that convention which, it now seems, our Australian domestic law is not consistent with.' That is, go down the path we went down last year in relation to the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act. Or, alternatively, we could have said, `We should exercise our right as a parliament to be the ultimate law-makers in the area of the common law and to tackle that particular court decision.' The judgment which the government has made, and which we are now asking the parliament to endorse, is that we should go down that second course; that we should pass legislation to restore the law, in terms of administrative law, to the circumstances as we understood them to be prior to the Federal Court and the High Court decisions in the Teoh case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's put the thing in its context. Firstly, we are a country which, if we are to be engaged with the world, has to have relationships with other countries around the world. There is hardly anything extraordinary about that. Secondly, this is a power expressly given to the government and the parliament by the Australian constitution. That is, our founders put their minds to these questions and resolved to give that power, in the constitution, to the national parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing novel or startling in the interpretation which the High Court gives to this power. It was not invented in 1983 with the Tasmanian dams case; its antecedents in terms of decisions of the High Court go back many decades before that. It is not a process which is done in secrecy, without telling anyone about it, at the stroke of a pen of a particular minister or the whim of a particular government at the time. There is a very extensive process of consultation and that process of consultation very extensively involves state governments in particular. There is a treaties committee, which is part of the COAG process, that meets regularly to discuss the arrangements Australia is looking at in terms of international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite commonly, state representatives, industry representatives and non-government organisations are part of Australia's negotiating teams in these international forums when we are going through the process of deciding or shaping a particular draft of an international convention. Far from locking people out of the process, they are very much part of the process. We believe that the appropriate balance, then, between the executive government and the parliament is that the parliament should have its role, its say, in terms of shaping the actual domestic law of Australia. That is why, in a case such as the sexual conduct bill last year, parliament was asked to change Australian domestic law&mdash;to make a new enactment to bring Australian domestic law on-line with the obligations that we had accepted as part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the appropriate role for the parliament to have&mdash;that the parliament should make that decision. But the constitution says&mdash;and it makes common sense&mdash;that the executive should have the role in acting and speaking for this country and its people in international fora and in deciding whether Australia should commit itself to a particular obligation. Before doing that, Australia should go through a very extensive exercise to see if our laws are, in fact, in line with the obligation we think it is appropriate that this country&mdash;and, indeed, countries around the world&mdash;should adopt for themselves. That is exactly what we do. And there is no better example of that than the Convention on the Rights of the Child which, over many years, went through an extensive exercise of consultation and involvement with the states to make sure that state law, as well as Commonwealth law, was consistent with the obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I understand that the opposition are suggesting that this particular bill should go to the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. I have no difficulty at all with parliamentary committee scrutiny of this bill. However, given that the Senate committee has already accepted a particular task in this matter, given that they have already started taking evidence on it and have agreed to a reporting date, and given that this same committee is having a look at the broader questions of the external affairs power and the treaty-making processes of government, it makes sense that the committee which has hopefully built up expertise in this area, might be the committee to take on this task&mdash;rather than re-inventing the wheel by referring it to a House committee. So without any disrespect to the capacity of the House legal committee, I will not be referring this particular bill to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appropriate response to a decision of the High Court which extends Australian administrative law into an area which the government does not agree with. It is an appropriate response for the parliament to take. I welcome the opposition's support for the legislation. However I do reject their particular amendment, and the arguments which attach to it, as just so much grandstanding, as another forum for the various xenophobias and hysterias which seem to lurk in many opposition hearts when we discuss this subject. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a very important piece of legislation. It involves a number of important issues in relation to treaties and the way in which they are considered. In that context it is not appropriate, in our view, simply to rely upon a separate inquiry on a wider range of treaties issues, as was admitted by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), to relieve this parliament and this chamber of its responsibility to scrutinise the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great disappointment to me that the committees of this parliament are not utilised for considering legislation in detail. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has a number of members who have quite considerable talents, in my view, to bring to bear on this issue. The committee is chaired by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). My colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) is a member, as is the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I think the eminence and ability of those members ought not to be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to try to get an assessment of what tremendous load this committee has before it at the moment and I found that its only current inquiry is the interpretation and application of the provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. It is not as if the committee does not have time or opportunity or inclination, as I understand it, to want to look at the detail of this legislation and to give the Attorney the benefit of its considered view on the matter. I noted that the Attorney indicated that there is already a Senate review of aspects of what he said was a broader question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously this bill can come before it. The point I am making is that the view has developed over time that the Senate is the only chamber that is able to contribute to these matters. There is the view that it is important to get the bill out of this place as quickly as possible and into the other place as if that will in some way speed up the deliberations on it. I suspect that, if the bill is carried today and if the government uses its numbers to resist this motion, it will not enhance the speed with which the bill is dealt with. I do not believe we will get a better bill only as a result of the Senate deliberations. I hasten to remind the Attorney that it was the legal and constitutional committee that contributed in a very positive way to the legislation dealing with quite difficult issues concerning the external application of laws of Australia in relation to paedophilia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was seen to be deficient. The legislation was significantly improved and, I believe, acknowledged by the government to have been improved by the detailed consideration of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these matters, we are run by the views of significant minorities in the Senate. If we continue to roll over and take the view that this House will not deal with legislation in detail, the Senate will continue to believe that it is the only chamber that can contribute positively on these matters. It seems to me, and certainly to my colleagues, that this is an appropriate reference, that it would serve the parliament well and that we may well be able to persuade the Senate to have another look at it if it knows this chamber will give detailed consideration to it by a reference to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would encourage the Attorney-General to reconsider his approach on this matter as I think there are very good and sound reasons for it. It would ultimately lead to consideration of the bill in a more expeditious way rather than leaving it in the hands of the Senate, which has so much more before it and seems to take on so many other issues, which would lead to a delay. If the Senate were satisfied this chamber had looked at it more thoroughly and in more detail, it may give more expeditious consideration to this bill in the end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the suspension of standing orders to enable a motion, as foreshadowed by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), to be moved. We are probably at a crossroads in the use of House of Representatives' committees for the consideration of legislation in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was referred to the Senate committee by the Senate selection committee equivalent. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee has an enormous burden at the moment. It has the bill based on the High Court decision in Ridgeway, this bill based on the High Court decision in Teoh, a couple of other bills, as well as the current reference in relation to the costs of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in the Easton inquiry. It has been given deadlines by the Senate which all expire at the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a realistic job is to be done by the Senate committee in relation to each of those references, it would be working flat out 24 hours a day until the end of the month. The fact of the matter is they will not be able to do a thorough job at all, and I suspect some of those references are going to be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, one might ask, is the bill allowed to be referred to a Senate committee but not to a House committee? I direct the question to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). The Minister for Justice has so far had the carriage of this matter in this House. Both ministers know that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has done very creditable, non-partisan jobs on important legislation&mdash;the member for Berowra mentioned the child sex tourism legislation. There was also the international war crimes tribunal legislation, the employment services legislation and, most recently, the Legislative Instruments Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Legislative Instruments Bill, by special arrangement negotiated between the committee and the Attorney-General, the committee undertook to complete its inquiry, which was a thorough one, within a very limited time frame. It achieved that target. Something like four or five months ago it delivered a report, and we still have not seen the government response to that bill. That inquiry demonstrates that the House committee is capable of doing a thorough job expeditiously because it is not burdened, like the Senate committee is, with numerous references and with the difficulties created by the party representation in that house and on those committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the simple reason is that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice do not want the competent committee of this House to look at this bill. Why may be the subject of conjecture, but I do not think one needs to have the power of foresight to think of what the reasons might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House committee could do a very thorough job very quickly within a time frame that would see this legislation through in the same sort of time frame as a Senate committee review. Frankly, I hope that the Senate committee postpones its consideration of the Teoh bill until it can do a thorough job. It is such an important bill that it needs a thorough examination. Both sides of this House know that the bill is very contentious. There are very eminent persons expressing very strong opposition to the principle behind the bill. During the second reading debate, I mentioned Sir Ronald Wilson, the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt and a number of legal and civil rights bodies that are similarly expressing opposition. Their views have not been taken into account. The legislation was rushed into the House on 28 June, less than two months after the decision was brought down. I think it has been ill thought through and needs a very thorough airing. A proper parliamentary inquiry would result in such an airing being given. I strongly support the suspension of standing orders in order to move that the bill be referred to the House committee for inquiry and report in a time frame that would meet the requirements of the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take up too much time of the House's time, but I wish to support this motion to suspend standing orders. If one consults <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, it can be seen that it was I who first raised the question with the Speaker regarding the original Federal Court case on this matter. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) may remember his own interjection at the time, which was, `We're appealing.' My response was to ask on what grounds they might appeal. I said that all the arguments previously put to the High Court on occasions when the government was trying to prove that it had a responsibility to override state and other law were entirely the same types of arguments that Mr Teoh's lawyers would put in due course before the High Court&mdash;which they did. And they won. Now we have some action to try to fix it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that there is already considerable debate amongst the legal profession that this attempt will also fail if someone chooses to challenge it. Surely the government might take the help of some of the best legal brains in this chamber to assist it in getting it right this time. I guess that is fundamentally what we are on about. We are on about getting it right. We have grave reservations. I will not enter too far into the argument that the Attorney-General put about how good these particular conventions are for us. I have always feared that they would get a momentum of their own, as they have on this occasion. I have always asked why, in a democracy so well developed and, as the Attorney-General assured us, with laws that already met all these commitments, we would have to sign together with the rest of the world to promise to do something that we have done already while others quite frequently sign and ignore those responsibilities. We know that it has become a bit of an art form for the Commonwealth to obtain additional powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude on this point. It is a highly technical area. The government has lost once, when the Attorney-General was absolutely confident of winning. You might say they have lost twice. The simple fact is that they are now enacting another piece of law about which even people on their own side have concerns. They have the opportunity to test this legislation against some of the best legal brains in this place and against evidence from some of the nation's leading legal brains. That sounds infinitely sensible. We do not know of another case in the offing, so time is not entirely the government's enemy. I think they should immediately suspend this debate to have the motion properly put and decided with their support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to cause any difficulty for the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). The argument being put forward, that the House committee should consider the matter, I have no difficulty with in principle, and I would have to say in fairness that I would like to consider myself a strong supporter of the committee system in the House of Representatives. I had the experience of chairing the particular committee when this Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill was being asked to be referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Some of the faces are still common on that committee from when I had the good fortune to chair it, and the change in personnel in this parliament I do not think has diminished its high and able standing to do good and adequate work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also say that the growing role of the House committees, in particular the legal committee, not only to undertake policy references, if you like, but also to do particular references into legislation is something which I broadly support. A number of members have mentioned particular enactments or bills which have gone to the House committee, and they have gone either on my reference or the reference of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), and certainly without difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the difficulty I have is not with the pre-eminent minds of the House committee having a look at this particular bill but, I have to say without reference to me or without asking the government for a particular view on it, the Senate selection process has referred this bill already to the Senate committee. If there is a misapprehension about that, the Senate committee is looking at the broader questions of the external affairs power and international obligations, and this would fall within that. It is not simply looking at those broader questions; it is looking at the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of its first day of hearing, so not only has the matter been referred to the Senate committee, it has already started its hearings. It has had evidence from senior international lawyers from the international law division of my department, including Mr Rose; Mr Ryland and Ms Tongue from the Australian Law Reform Commission; Commissioners Dodson and Sidoti from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and an officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It has already started the task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how many times we are going to re-invent the wheel in this area. It may well be that the Senate committee is busy and has a number of references on its plate. If there had been even a bit of courtesy by running it past me and saying, `Look, we want this to be looked at by a parliamentary committee; what do you think about it,' I may well have said, `Well, look, you've got plenty on your plate; why don't we give it to the House committee?' But there was not even that level of consultation. Things are flicked off through the Senate processes, given to the Senate committee, the Senate committee accepts the reference, starts its work, hears some evidence and produces the first transcript of the hearing. The opposition now comes in and says, `That may well be, but we want another bite of the cherry down here as well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my reluctance to do that should not be taken as in any way a sleight at the competence or the capacity of the House committee. Knowing some of the people on that committee, I am sure they would do a more than adequate job when looking at this bill. The subject matter is of great interest to the House. We have already had a fulsome debate today. Everyone wants to have a say about it, and I appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of opinion on this bill, ranging from those who think the High Court decision was very sound indeed and that it is an absolute affront that the government should propose to act in the way that it is, and that I suppose really is where the criticism on the whole is coming from. It is coming from the opponents of the Teoh doctrine, if you like. I am not hearing a great critique of the effect of the bill in a technical sense, though maybe there are issues in terms of its technical effect as well that need to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reality is that there will be in-depth scrutiny of this bill by a parliamentary committee. That decision was taken for good or for bad by the Senate selection processes. That reference has started. The committee has a reporting date and has already heard from witnesses. It already has a body of quite extensive evidence. While not wishing to deny the opportunity of members of the House to delve into the matter as well&mdash;it is already under a parliamentary committee scrutiny process&mdash;given that that die is cast, it is my inclination to allow that process now to run. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I obviously have concerns about the whole situation of international treaties, but I certainly do not intend to recanvass those concerns in this debate on the motion to suspend standing orders. It is fairly clear the legislation we have debated today is complicated. There has been widespread criticism of it. Sir Ronald Wilson, Justice Evatt and Justice Michael Kirby are just three of the people who have expressed very great concerns. Indeed, the former Chief Justice of Australia Sir Anthony Mason only yesterday said that this legislation, while it might affect administrative decisions, does not refer to judicial action. The concern was how a national court would respond when confronted with a rule formulated by an international convention to which Australia had acceded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This item of legislation, like the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, ought to be looked at very closely before we seek to put it into law. The government has a majority of seven to five on the House committee&mdash;not that as a committee we normally vote along party lines. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), being a former chairman of that committee, admitted a moment ago that it is a very effective committee. We are privileged to have people of the calibre of the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) as members of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a responsibility to the people of Australia to get the legislation right. Concerns have been expressed, and there are doubts, about the constitutionality of what has been suggested. The government, with a majority of seven to five on the House committee, could if it really wanted to influence the report use its numbers to do so&mdash;not that I am suggesting for a moment that the members of the committee would do other than follow their own views after consideration of all the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister has concerns over delays, he could impose a time frame on the committee reporting which is consistent with the priorities of the government. While it might have been better to consult the Attorney-General at length prior to this matter coming into the chamber, the Attorney-General really ought to look at the importance of getting legislation right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General ought not to be piqued over the fact that he has not been consulted to the extent that he would like to have been consulted. The committee is eminently qualified to take evidence to consider this bill properly, a committee which would be able to report within a time frame of his choosing. I would ask the Attorney-General at this very late hour to reconsider his refusal to allow this bill to be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important piece of legislation. It is of concern to the Australian people. Doubts have been raised about this legislation by eminent people, not just those involved in politics.

<PARA>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. A very successful program of commemorative events has taken place as Australia Remembers. This program has touched the hearts of Australians of all ages, but the remembrance has been a special one for the veteran community and for those with close links with that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The veterans' affairs 1995 budget package reflects the government's response to the changing needs of the veteran community through the introduction of a range of simplified and expanded services. This bill contains amendments necessary to implement some of the budget elements. I foreshadow that I will be moving government amendments to some of the provisions later in the debate. Further bills, covering the remaining budget initiatives requiring legislative amendments, will be introduced shortly. Other measures do not require legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn to the matters contained in this bill, I would like to mention some of the non-legislative budget measures. In June this year, I announced an aged care policy for the veteran community, `As time goes by: Continuing the Commitment'. This policy sets out the future directions for care of the veteran community for the next five to ten years. The policy also includes the outcomes of the joint ministerial task force on veterans' aged care services that I established, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), last year to improve veterans' access to aged care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the recommendations of this task force, the government is introducing a five-year program to assist ex-service organisations, where necessary, to upgrade, replace or relocate their aged care facilities. This program will be complemented by a four-year community care seeding grants program to improve the range and availability of community services in areas of demonstrated need where there is a high veteran population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major initiative increases funding for research targeted to the health needs of the veteran community. A number of priority research areas will be identified each year to maintain the focus on veteran related issues. These arrangements will ensure that the health areas of most concern to veterans can be researched by the best scientists available in each field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To mark this year of remembrance, the government has extended air travel entitlement to Australia's three surviving Victoria Cross medal recipients for the remainder of their lives. The government is also contributing to special commemorative projects, such as the joint Australia-Thailand project for a memorial park centred on Hellfire Pass and nearby features of the railway that was constructed by Allied POW labour during World War II, and the project to erect a memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra to commemorate those who lost their lives in the Korean War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures announced by the government include payment of nursing home costs for Australian former prisoners of war, access to chiropractic and osteopathic services by entitled veterans, war widows and war widowers. The delivery of health care has been simplified by reducing, from four to two, the different types of treatment entitlement cards which increases the entitlement of 140,000 veterans, war widows and war widowers to services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to refer to the features of this bill. The bill makes a number of reforms to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. These reforms will allow increased responsiveness to the range of housing options now available to veterans and eligible dependants. The bill will extend eligibility for defence service home loans to cover several different title arrangements. Assistance will be available for properties held as tenants-in-common, on a company title, or on a leasehold title. The inclusion of these property titles reflects current commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to announce that this bill will extend eligibility for a defence service home loan to full-time members of World War II women's services. For 50 years, former members of the World War II women's services who did not actually serve overseas during wartime have been excluded from defence service homes benefits, unlike many of the male service volunteers. In taking the initiative to redress that situation, the government recognises the major contribution to the war effort made by thousands of female volunteers who joined the services on the same basis as their male counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many veterans and others eligible for a defence service home loan find their housing needs change as they grow older. Retirement village or granny flat accommodation becomes the preferred arrangement for many who have difficulty living independently. The bill will increase flexibility in the use of the housing loan by allowing eligible persons to assign their loan entitlement to secure entry to a retirement village managed by an organisation which has, as its prime purpose, the provision of accommodation to veterans and veterans' widows. Assignment of the loan to provide a granny flat will also be available, provided that type of accommodation is appropriate to the needs of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a move that will be particularly welcomed by the many individuals who have sought the change, the bill will extend the option to insure under the Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme to all persons eligible under the Defence Service Homes Act, irrespective of whether they have received a defence service home loan on their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes other changes to the defence service home loan arrangements to increase its flexibility, such as allowing portability of a loan with the interest rates and remaining term of the current loan, and introducing generic certificates of entitlement. The bill also provides for cancellation of payment of the loan subsidy after the death of both the eligible veteran and any surviving spouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to outline the changes the bill makes to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The bill clarifies aspects of pension eligibility provisions in relation to allotment for duty and service in an operational area. As explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members, the legislation has been improved so that it leads a reader through the relevant provisions, and develops a clearer understanding of the relationship between those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Veterans' Entitlements Act commenced in 1986, the Repatriation Act 1920 set out the service requirements for both a service pension and a disability pension. This bill preserves the original intention and concepts from the Repatriation Act, that qualifying service for a service pension arose from incurring danger from hostile forces of the enemy in a theatre of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since World War II, qualifying service has required service in the operational area to which the veteran was allotted. The bill also confirms this as the requirement for operational service that attracts the beneficial standard of proof for disability pension claims. The bill makes it clear that members of units allotted for duty in Korea, but who served only in Japan, have operational service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also enable any excess payment of Social Security pensions and benefits received by a veteran's partner that result from a retrospective grant or increase of disability pension to be deducted from the lump sum arrears of disability pension. These new arrangements will result in a speedier payment of the balance of disability pension arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a number of changes to eligibility for a partner service pension. Firstly, from 1 October 1995 a partner service pension will not be granted unless the partner is 50 years or older, or is caring for a dependent child. Existing partner service pensioners will not be affected. This change is consistent with the government's Working Nation policy, which highlights the need to encourage work force participation. Of course, those partners who are ineligible for a partner service pension will be able to test eligibility for another income support payment, such as a carer service pension, or disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill will enable those who qualify for a partner service pension to retain eligibility for that pension, even if the veteran loses payability of his age or invalidity service pension. Thirdly, a person, including a widow or a widower, will be eligible for a partner service pension if the person qualifies for an age pension and if their partner is, or was, a veteran with qualifying service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also limits the rate of service pension payable to a person who is a member of a couple to the partnered rate of pension, even though the other member of the couple may not be receiving a pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a number of changes to the income support supplement. The government introduced the income support supplement from March this year. The purpose of this supplement is to allow war widows and widowers to receive their compensation and income support payment from one department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs. One of the changes will better target persons who could benefit from this single payment arrangement, by extending eligibility for the income support supplement to war widows and widowers who are partners of service or social security pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change will be the exclusion of war widow or widower's pension when calculating bereavement payments to surviving partners of income support supplement recipients. Last year the government initiated major extensions of treatment and support services for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder around Australia. Many veterans have directly benefited from specialised in-patient services and many more have received counselling and support services from the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service. This bill now introduces automatic eligibility for post-traumatic stress disorder treatment. Early intervention in post-traumatic stress disorder cases greatly increases the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes. Younger veterans and other veterans of all ages and all conflicts, being now assured of access to treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, will be encouraged to seek appropriate early treatment for psychiatric problems brought on by post-traumatic stress disorder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reform being introduced in this bill will simplify access to services by some people. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be able to issue a seniors health card to certain widows and widowers and to non-illness separated spouses of veterans. This is not an extension of eligibility for the seniors health card, as these people are otherwise eligible for a card from the Department of Social Security, but the changes will be of considerable convenience to those who may periodically lose and gain payability of a pension from my department. In concluding, I believe that this bill presents important measures that respond to the changing needs of the veteran community. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take pleasure in responding to this legislation on behalf of the coalition as the shadow minister and inform the House that we do not intend to oppose or amend the bill. Nevertheless, it has to be taken in the context of its total financial impact. Of the 14 items that we are changing today, four have no financial impact, five will cost the government additional money and five will result in savings. The net effect of all that is that in 1995-96 the savings will be of the order of $3.453 million and, in 1998-99, $8.696 million. So whilst most of the measures are, in my view, positive, there is a reduction in the amount of funding available for veterans in relation to these services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, this legislation comprises amendments to existing veterans legislation which are required to implement some elements of the 1995-96 budget changes to the veterans' affairs portfolio. Further legislation will contain the balance of the 1995-96 budget changes. The majority of the changes are in relation to extending eligibility to the defence service homes scheme for women's service personnel from World War II and allowing more scope in title, possession or otherwise eligible persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act include a proposed change to stop any new grants of service pensions to partners of service pensioners who are under the age of 50 years or who do not have dependent children. I shall speak in some detail on that matter in a moment. We commend the government for its action in relation to the DSH benefits to full-time members of the World War II women's services, but we point out that this proposal results from a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and follows a conciliation conference. So some pressure was applied on this issue. Nevertheless, we welcome the government's action in this regard. As the minister said, it is not before time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be understood that, whilst the original rules related to persons with overseas service, so many women in World War II, due to public attitudes at the time, were not given that opportunity. No doubt they would have served overseas&mdash;as many did, particularly in the medical professions&mdash;but it was believed to be better that the men went overseas to the war zones and that the women stayed back in Australia. That allowed for a greater availability of the male population for war service. It was the women who filled the jobs and the military positions at home. As a result, war service was available to so many more males. We welcome the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not, of course, an extremely expensive proposition for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that many of these women today would not be seeking this assistance. Of course, some of them are no longer with us. I believe this proposal will cost $386,000 in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issues that the minister has mentioned&mdash;many of which are relatively minor&mdash;are supported by the coalition. These proposals represent the changes in our society. These measures allow for the construction of a granny flat on what is obviously someone else's property. There is also provision for this money to be used to buy into the various forms of veterans and aged persons villages. It is an eminently sensible proposition and we welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the new opportunities for elderly people in Australia. I believe that the granny flat is one of the great inventions, if I can use that word, of modern day society. It presents an opportunity for an older person to be in close touch with a daughter or son or other close relative, yet have the independence of a small unit on the same property. This is an excellent development. The government, in recognising this and allowing eligible persons to raise loans to build such a facility on another person's property, has acted sensibly. When we look at the various villages that have been constructed these days we find that many service organisations&mdash;the RSL and the air force association and others&mdash;are actively involved, along with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A granny flat might bring people in close contact with new relatives, but the purpose of the village is to allow people to have close contact with people of their own age group. They receive support from this group and are able to participate in sports&mdash;such as bowls&mdash;within the boundaries of the development. They are able to receive a little bit of extra help on the days when they might feel a little down. Someone is able to drop in and offer them a little comfort or bring them a meal. It is a self-support type of approach. They are very good proposals. Naturally they have our support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed to cancel the subsidy of DSH loans from a date three months after the death of the last surviving member of an eligible couple is also sensible. It is just responding to a situation where, apparently from time to time, the loan entitlement is transferred to people who are not eligible and the subsidies continue to be paid. This amendment resolves that sort of problem. The move to give expanded eligibility for insuring dwellings under the DSH act is also one with which the opposition concurs. The same applies to portable loans and interest rate stabilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of eligibility for pensions incorporates the question to which the minister and I have referred, which relates to the age at which a person becomes eligible for a partner pension. After quite a bit of soul searching, the coalition has decided to support the amendment. But I express reservations. Whilst we are not opposing this measure, as it is a government measure and it does relate to their budget announcement, there is a degree of concern. Our concern relates to the fact that this arbitrary choice of age 50 simply does not recognise the age of some veterans, particularly those who participated in the Vietnam War, where spouses would be expected to be below the age of 50. Although the explanation is that if you are below the age of 50 you can access many other social security benefits, including the unemployment benefit, Vietnam veterans in particular feel that it does not recognise their age group and is an impractical proposition for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought propositions could be provided that, whilst recognising the basic principle, would have created the circumstance where this group that is aged roughly 50 at this time could have also been recognised. I hope that we will be able to correct that one day. I think it has become too limited and narrow. A very minor amendment would have resolved it. The basic idea is that, under present law, a quite elderly veteran with a service pension entitlement can marry a very young person. Upon the veteran's decease, the current arrangement is that that younger spouse is entitled to continue to receive the partner pension. I do not think that is right. It has to be understood that, in the context of that younger person remarrying or forming a permanent relationship, that pension entitlement ceases. I would imagine that very few of that age group would remain unmarried or celibate for the rest of time. So it is probably not as huge a problem as it is made out to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we accept that fundamental principle. We just do not see where the Vietnam veterans fit in when their age group at this stage is about 50. As is known, quite a high percentage of those people are the recipients of various entitlements resulting from things such as post traumatic stress disorder, which are mentioned here. Some of these Vietnam veterans are already eligible for certain pension entitlements. Their spouses, by the simple fact that they are 45-year-olds married to 50-year-olds, get nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that caucus allowed this measure to pass, because I am sure they received the same sort of correspondence that I did. In the end, having considered that matter and a suitable amendment, the coalition has decided to give the government their bill. After all, it is their legislation. More importantly, it was a budget measure. We did not respond in any negative way at the time of the budget response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that is my only area of concern. It is something, as this bill demonstrates, that can be amended at some other time and I certainly will be pressing my colleagues over time to look at it, depending on the extent to which it does disadvantage people. Not a huge number of people would be disadvantaged, because only a limited number would eventually find themselves in that circumstance. Nevertheless, it is a fact that people will be affected and I just think that the overall figure was not a very suitable approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the five minutes I have in which to conclude, I point out that at the beginning of his remarks the minister made references to Australia Remembers. He is well aware of the very enthusiastic support that the coalition has given to his program and I do not back away from that. But I express some concern. We have had an excellent bipartisan approach to something that the nation should have only treated in that fashion. Of course, he is aware that I have had correspondence with him regarding the member for Lilley (Mr Swan), but the member for Lilley does not give up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, Mr Speaker, you would be well aware from your own constituents that when these excellent certificates of appreciation were produced with the signatures of both the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) thereon and the opportunity for the local member's signature, the following application form was prepared. You can see it is a two-sided form and it was made as such, I imagine, because a lot of elderly veterans would have filled it in and they would have wanted plenty of space to see what they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the member for Lilley decided that he was missing too many opportunities, so he shrank his form on to one side of the paper and then chose to print on the back of it comments such as, `Since March 1983 the pension rate has increased faster than real wages.' Then he says, `This is in stark contrast to the record of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard.' I know there are those people who would never miss the opportunity to kick a head, but I find it extremely disappointing that someone would get down there on this particular issue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I will draw to the minister's attention, without criticism, is that we also had the understanding that when it came to presenting certificates, plaques or anything else, it was a responsibility of members of parliament, the RSL or someone who could be clearly identified as totally apolitical. I am disappointed to see that in the electorate of Deakin, Mr Ken Aldred's electorate&mdash;a sitting member of this place&mdash;an ALP candidate has been running around issuing plaques for Australia Remembers. In the seconds I have left, I ask that that sort of thing not be proceeded with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Stupid laughter from the Leader of the Opposition does not make it any more real to assert than it is. The fact is that this is an issue for overseas borrowings. Let me put it this way: if Australians were all financing their mortgages by borrowing in Zurich, New York or Tokyo, this would be relevant. But, as far as I am aware, most of them are not: they are borrowing from banks or financial institutions in Australia. It has nothing whatever to do with overseas borrowings. So it is an absurdity in the extreme to argue that there is some connection between foreign debt and any ratings that we might have as a result of our level of foreign debt for external borrowing purposes and the level of mortgage interest rates. There is no connection whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important is inflation. The reason that interest rates today for mortgages are two per cent lower for bank loans than they were when the Leader of the Opposition ceased being Treasurer of this country, and the reason building society loans are 3.5 per cent lower than they were&mdash;of course, for the banks it was a limited amount: people had to cocktail it with personal loans or overdrafts at much higher rates of interest&mdash;is that inflation is lower. That is the determining factor. We have much lower inflation today than the Leader of the Opposition had. He had double digit inflation and double digit unemployment&mdash;the terrible quinella. With that he had very high interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he left office, the rate for 90-day bank bills was about double the rate today. Official interest rates were 12.9 per cent. Today they are 7 1/2 per cent. The only way he kept mortgage rates down was by regulation. The central bank did not set them. The monetary policy committee of the cabinet set them. The Governor of the Reserve Bank sat outside waiting to hear what the interest rates were. That was the way it worked.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to answer that question, not enough. We have not received enough in terms of policy detail. It was explained to us as to why policy detail was not being given at this time, but nevertheless it does make it hard for us to start choosing who would be the best person to get our vote.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd like to be looking at what is the future policies and what we would be able to expect of any government.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, and not unreasonably, Mr Tyree is asking for the same honesty in politics that is never disposable about the presentation of policies&mdash;the very point of credibility and honesty in public life. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday treated the MTIA with contempt. He basically brazenly stared them down when that major business group running a major section of Australian industry asked him what his policy would stand for.</PARA>

<PARA>Then there is their industrial relations policy. Yesterday, while all this was going on&mdash;and we have heard all these incantations about honesty in politics&mdash;he had the truck out the front with a sign saying that the per capita debt was $10,000.

We have just chalked up a period of very rapid employment growth, some of the fastest employment growth that we have ever recorded, and certainly faster than just about any other country in the Western world, with growth of over four per cent in the last 12 months and, particularly, through 1994-95, growth of almost five per cent in employment.</PARA>

We have substantial growth in the economy, we have substantial employment growth, we have the unemployment rate coming down rapidly, and interest rates are not stopping that.

It has not been the kind of boom-and-bust thing that there has been in the past; it has been a low-inflation recovery. It is a low-inflation recovery because policy has been well set to achieve that, and we can go on for some time, certainly for the foreseeable future, with a growth economy because we have been successful in containing inflation, and monetary policy has a role to play in that.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1502" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is a welcome question because it is the case that we have very good prospects for export growth in this country. The budget proposed was based on the fact that we would have growth of exports of around some 15 per cent, growing off a period of low growth last year. That of course reflected the fact that we have had the drought in 1994-95, which was a great burden for us in terms of having export growth, and clearly a major factor in restricting our exports and, therefore, in producing the current account outcome of six per cent of GDP for 1994-95.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have been struggling against the fact that our major trading partner, Japan, has for some three or four years been going through a period of no growth. When our major trading partner is not doing anything, it obviously impacts on us in terms of the volumes we can sell to it and the prices we get for those volumes. We have been affected in both those ways by the fact that our major trading partner has been going through such a difficult economic period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of exports, we have been through a hard period in 1994-95, but we expect that to turn around considerably in 1995-96. In that respect, we note that the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has recently announced that it has upped its forecast for growth of commodity exports from 12.9 per cent for this year to 14 per cent, which means that growth of commodity exports will be $7 billion this year, compared with last year's growth of just over $1 billion. That is a hell of an increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That increase reflects the breaking of the drought, which is obviously important in terms of the rural economy. With rural prices the way they are, we expect not too much of a major burst from the rural sector but some recovery of volumes. In terms of the mining sector, we expect a tremendous growth&mdash;a 20 per cent increase in mineral exports. That 20 per cent increase is about half-and-half volumes and prices. That reflects the fact that we will get better prices particularly for iron ore and coal, which have already been negotiated with Japan, but also for alumina and aluminium. This will give us not only better prices but also better volumes across the whole swag of mineral exports. A 20 per cent increase in mineral exports for 1995-96 is certainly a major boost to the balance of trade and to the balance of payments, and it means that we can expect to see improvement as forecast in the budget&mdash;in fact, probably better than was forecast in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking beyond 1995-96, we see reason for even more optimism. We have about $11 billion of resource projects which are either committed or under construction at the present time. All those major projects are export oriented and, as they come to fruition and push out the volumes, they will certainly give us further strong growth in mineral exports. We would also hope for expansion from all the existing projects. So we have considerable reason for optimism for the growth of exports, not only in 1995-96 but beyond it&mdash;into the rest of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the outlook for exports, the Australian people have reason for optimism indeed. We can look forward to the possibility of a better balance of payments outcome than was forecast in the budget because of all these improvements. We have also been aided by the fact that Japan has now announced another package, a package of $A183 billion, which is about equal to 40 per cent of our GDP. It is an enormous package. Spread over three years, the impact of that package this year is likely to be about one per cent of their GDP. That will certainly give a boost to demand in one of the major economies in the world, and it will help growth in that economy and in the world economy generally. That is also very good for our export prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlook for the balance of payments is definitely one of improvement. The budget had forecast improvement of about half a per cent of GDP, but increasingly private sector forecasters are saying that they think we have probably been too pessimistic. I noticed the other day that Consensus Economics, a London based body which surveys private sector forecasters all over the world, and which surveyed the Australian private forecasters, is now expecting that in calendar year 1996 the balance of payments current account deficit will be about $22.3 billion, as against the $27 billion which was forecast in the budget for 1995-96. We are clearly looking, in terms of the general assessment of the private sector, at a greatly improved outlook for the Australian balance of payments. There is every reason to believe that, given the kinds of export prospects I have outlined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is important is that we have the right policy settings for us to be able to grow in a low inflation way and a sustained way, as I mentioned previously. That is how monetary policy is set in this country. It is producing outcomes which are very good for the people of Australia. It means that real incomes are increasing; real wages are increasing by about 1 1/2 per cent per annum. So do not tell me that wage and salary earners are not benefiting from increased real wages. They are better off as a result of this growth economy. Household disposable incomes have increased by 2 1/2 per cent per annum per capita over the last few years.

How do we compare in terms of employment growth? Tremendous. We are almost the top of the league for employment growth in the Western industrialised world. How do we compare in terms of improving real incomes? We are improving real incomes quite significantly now for the whole economy.

Is it the intention of the government to embrace any alternative proposals and would such an alternative approach meet the best interests of Australian workers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1504" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a much more decentralised labour market where wages and conditions are set on an enterprise basis, a test as to whether the system will work has to apply so that with any change in conditions or payments working people are not disadvantaged. In other words, they can change the package, they can change the nature of their remuneration, but not the totality. We said in the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1992 that for an agreement to be certified there must be no disadvantage to employees. That is essentially what it means&mdash;flexibility without disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not what is being proposed by the federal opposition. The member for Flinders uses this terminology disingenuously and dishonestly about a no disadvantage test but not the no disadvantage test&mdash;a test that they may dream up in the future but not one which would be certified, not the  current no disadvantage test but some other as yet undefined test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply done to hide the fact that, if some award conditions are removed, there will be no compensation for working people under a coalition government. So we now understand exactly where the coalition is coming from. Let me just give a couple of quotes on this. The honourable member for Bennelong, when asked last year if he envisaged any rewrite of Jobsback, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I don't, because it is right.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I certainly don't want to see the basic direction of the IR policy changed because I think it is the right one for Australia, the right policy for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In January 1995 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think Jobsback is basically right but for two things.</PARA>
<PARA>These were the youth wage and the opting out approach. He added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond that, I saw and see it as a very sound policy.</PARA>
<PARA>But there is more. That relates to the current Western Australian legislation. On 28 July in Perth Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition government has implemented in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Three weeks ago the same person said in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said that I supported the IR laws that had already been enacted in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>So the coalition supports the current legislation in the Western Australian state acts, which is completely consistent with Jobsback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move to the honourable member for Flinders who said in March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobsback is the thrust of coalition policy.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prospect of going down in history as a person who consistently advocated wide ranging and substantive reform of Australia's industrial relations system is one that fills me with pride.</PARA>
<PARA>But it fills the rest of the community with anxiety. In the Western Australian legislation there are only four conditions. There is no provision for overtime, penalty rates or holiday loadings. There is an adult minimum wage of only $301 for a 40-hour week; that is $15,650 for an adult person for a 40-hour week. The minimum wage payable to young people aged 16 is $3.77 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just interpose for you what this means. For a typical unskilled worker who works the average overtime of 10 hours per week, who gets time and a half for the first two hours and double time after that, the higher rate increases earnings by $94 a week compared with being paid at the base rate of pay. To an unskilled labourer this is worth $4,888 a year. In what sense is it no disadvantage to Australia's one million labourers if they face pay cuts of 17 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the example of a part-time worker on low pay&mdash;a nurse who works 16 hours each weekend. Without compensation for weekend rates, the nurse's pay is reduced by $115 per week; that is $5,970 per year, a fall of 38 per cent. Nurses are an excellent example because of their great reliance on night rates. These are worth 15 per cent more than the base pay, and practically all the nurses work them. On average, taking into account weekend and morning penalty rates, a typical nurse would stand to lose about 22 per cent of annual income, or more than $5,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the example of a typical transport worker, a truck driver. On 12 hours of overtime per week, he would lose the additional payment and could have a pay cut of $113.35 a week, or $5,910 a year, a cut of 18 per cent. And there are 360,000 drivers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the consequences of the coalition's wages policy, industrial relations policy, that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Flinders now support and say they are very proud of. At the same time they will force people off awards. They want to hide behind saying, `We will give people a choice.' But they do not mention the 590,000 people who come out of higher education institutions and who would start without an award and have no choice to ever have an award. Then there are half of the 400,000 year 11 and 12 students who would have no choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the data shows is that 1,731,000 people face a new employer each year. As a consequence, in three years 3 1/2 million people would lose the award option and be forced to individual pay contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the policy of the opposition&mdash;to cut the wages of working Australians. It is not as if the profit share is not high enough. We saw the profit figures a couple of weeks ago at an historic high. So what is their complaint? Is it that the lowest paid workers in the community are paid too much? Is it that the profit share isn't high enough? Why does the Liberal Party hate working Australians? Why do those opposite want to cut their wages? Why do they hate ordinary working people? I have said this before. Coming from the drive of a petrol station why would you hate the person who arrives in the car in front of you? Why would you in the surrounding area want to cut back the wages of working Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a direct consequence of the adoption of Western Australian style industrial relations by the federal coalition. I think all Australians should understand that when the member for Flinders says there will be a no disadvantage test, he does not mean the no disadvantage test. He means one he might dream up so he can cut the guts out of the wages of working Australians. That is the one he means, and all working Australians should take notice.</PARA>

We have to link it to the job activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Adelaide last week we did just that. I had the opportunity to visit the member for Bonython's electorate: to go back to the schools that had put this challenge to the government some four weeks previously. With a group of schools in the Salisbury area we developed a program which does this. It guarantees a job for 12 months&mdash;or, where it is appropriate, further education and training&mdash;to all those students who successfully complete the vocational studies program offered by the schools. In other words, we are delivering the training, but we are linking and guaranteeing it to a job activity. That was as a response to the specific proposals in discussions that occurred at that youth conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday, I might add, we will be announcing a similar program for seven more regions around this country which, like the schools at Salisbury and Adelaide, have high youth unemployment and where the schools have been innovative enough to work their programs into the vocational training system. Just as the training to jobs link is important, so too is the reverse. The fact is that the jobs are there, but in circumstances in which the training has not been available. What Working Nation has been about has been opening up a whole gamut of new training activities in occupations that previously did not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give one example: there was a newspaper report today of the big growth in employment in child care but the lack of qualifications in the people undertaking child care. Why? Because there has not been a traineeship for child care until Working Nation; just as there has not been a traineeship for the environment, for sport, and for the arts and entertainment&mdash;all of the growth areas, if you don't know about it. Do you know what the growth in child care has been in the last 12 months? Ninety per cent! There have been 26,000 jobs in child care but no traineeship until Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That traineeship is now in place and already has 350 people in it. Again, it is the response of Working Nation recognising where the problems are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation has seen a huge increase in participation in training. It is interesting to note that traineeship vacancies notified with the CES jumped spectacularly in August. They have gone up to 2,300, which is the most vacancies for traineeships ever registered.

Yesterday in answer to a question from me you claimed that the $5 million a year youth homelessness program called JPET had not been closed down but had merely been transferred into your portfolio in an expanded form. Is it a fact that both your department and the Department of Housing and Regional Development have confirmed there is no money in the budget for JPET under any name or portfolio? Is it a fact that the absorption of JPET into generic programs in your portfolio, without the provision of any additional money for these programs, has been condemned by welfare and youth sectors? How can you claim that JPET has not been closed down when service providers have been told by the government not to take on new clients or to seek funding from existing DEET programs which do not provide support available under JPET? In accepting your challenge yesterday, is it not a fact that the DEET special intervention program cannot in its present form operate as a structured JPET type program? Will you change it or otherwise have the courage to admit that you have callously deserted one of the most disadvantaged groups in this nation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Calare for his interest in many communications issues. Last night, I did have the pleasure of officially turning on Australia's first cable television project, Optus Vision. Optus Vision plans to invest $3 billion over the next few years in developing a digital cable network to deliver not just pay TV but also local telephony come early next year and, ultimately, interactive broadband services. Next month, Foxtel cable TV will be up and running. It will be providing consumers with, I understand, up to 20 channels of choice. Telstra will be investing $4 billion over the next few years developing its broadband network.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These investments are good for Australia. They are investments that are creating large numbers of jobs not just at Foxtel and Optus Vision but also at the equipment suppliers and the cable manufacturers. It is also upgrading Australia's communications infrastructure for the next century. That is something which is good for the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only person who has been talking down this massive billon dollar investment in cable technology is the opposition spokesman on communications and the arts, Senator Alston. The opposition got a bit bored with me quoting silly remarks that Senator Alston made last year when the government announced its policy on cable. Some people might think that&mdash;with the member for Mayo, the former opposition leader, moving on&mdash;perhaps Senator Alston now representing the member for Bennelong might have a more rational and honest policy on communications.</PARA>

Senator Alston is the only person who is running around saying&mdash;with the exception of Kenneth Davidson&mdash;that this investment in cable is money down the drain. So that is the official position of the Liberal-National Party. Senator Alston said this morning that the government and I, as the communications minister, should have been taking action to minimise the duplication, to minimise this investment in cable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several members opposite are saying, `Hear, hear.' The member for Warringah also thinks that there should not be this duplication. If we had had this attitude adopted in 1991 when the Labor government introduced competition in telephony, we would not have had Optus being allowed to cable up and duplicate the links between all of the capital cities. It is only Optus's decision to duplicate the fibre-optic links between the capital cities that has delivered competition on long distance telephone calls. If you had not had that duplication, there would be no competition on long distance calls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has that duplication delivered? It has delivered lower prices for consumers, greater investment in the equipment and a wider choice of services for consumers. It is something that has again been good for Australians, whether they live in the bush or in the cities. Yet the opposition just does not understand the point that the duplication of infrastructure&mdash;or the threat of it&mdash;is essential if you are going to get competition in communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition spokesman, Senator Alston, has a different model. Under Senator Alston's model, the minister for communications will sit there with the maps of Australia rolled out on his desk and he will decide where telephone companies can invest their capital. That is the Alston model. So, under that model, Optus will have to get Senator Alston's permission before it can put new cables in to duplicate Telstra's infrastructure. When the government says that it wants new carriers to set up in Australia after July 1997 to provide more competition and more benefits for consumers, the member for Bennelong's official policy is that, no, new carriers are welcome but they will have to get the permission of the Liberal Party&mdash;the permission of Senator Alston&mdash;before they can invest in new cable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of saying that you will welcome new carriers in telecommunications but they cannot invest any money in cable to provide their services unless they have the permission of the Liberal minister for communications? It is ridiculous. It is a return to Soviet central planning in communications. You can just imagine Senator Alston calling in Bob Mansfield and Frank Blount and telling them that this is the Liberal Party's five-year plan for communications: `If you follow our five-year plan we'll be pinning the medals on your chest.'

These companies know more about how they should invest their dollars than does the government. It is amazing that the so-called party of free enterprise, the so-called spokesman for the Liberal Party and the honourable member for Bennelong should know more about where capital should be invested in communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition might think that this is a minor issue; it is only pay TV. But let me assure the House that it is not just pay TV. From next year it will be competition on local calls. In a short time it will also be competition on these interactive broadband services, the ability to call up video on demand, the ability to call up information and to transfer information from the National Library or the National Film and Sound Archive to school libraries. It is the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing that the Liberal Party cannot understand why you need to have competition in supplying this essential infrastructure. It is only through having that competition that we can ensure that Australian consumers and businesses are able to receive these information services without getting ripped off by the monopoly cable owners.

Will the Prime Minister give a guarantee that when the parliament sits next Wednesday he will brush aside any other commitments and come into parliament so that he can focus on matters of real concern, such as the uncertainty faced by families in respect of their mortgages, small businesses under pressure, farmers facing mounting debt, young people who cannot find work and the elderly who have to wait for hip replacements? Or is it a fact, Prime Minister, that the only way to get you to come to work on a Wednesday and display any concern for any issue is for a newspaper to raise the issue of your baldness?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued growth of foreign debt which is undermining Australia's economic growth potential and imposing higher than necessary interest rates on Australian families and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the government document prepared by Vince FitzGerald entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Savings Strategy</EMPHASIS>. One of the key points reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot, on a sustainable basis, continue to finance the investment we need to grow over the 1990s, and into the new century, by going progressively further into foreign debt. We are already paying a significant premium on our borrowings and are becoming gradually more exposed to external shocks.</PARA>
<PARA>The report then talks about risk premium. Members should remember that this is a government document; it is not a document prepared by the opposition. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt.</PARA>
<PARA>It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates along these lines are consistent with between a quarter and a half a percentage point being added to our interest rates. This would imply additional annual servicing costs of up to $1 billion, about 0.25 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) today referred to the budget documents. The budget documents, on the question of the policy challenge from this government&mdash;fancy, a policy challenge from this government!&mdash;went on to discuss the need to grow without excessive recourse to foreign savings. The Treasurer did not read further from the documents. The document goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large part of the increase in foreign liabilities has been in the form of debt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>surprise, surprise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">rather than equity . . . Net foreign debt as a proportion of GDP increased from less than 10 per cent in the latter part of the 1970s&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>back in 1980 the ratio of net external debt to GDP was 5.6 per cent of GDP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to a peak of 43 per cent at September 1993 before declining to 37 per cent at December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>I have news for you. It is back to 39.8 per cent or $180 billion. It is interesting to look at these quotes. I was looking through some documents the other day and it was interesting to find the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) talking about jobs growth and the potential for youths to get jobs. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was interviewed in relation to this matter by Ray Martin on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday</EMPHASIS> on 17 July 1991. Ray Martin asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, are you saying there's a generation of guinea pigs out there; there's a bunch of parents who are going to have to accept the fact that their kids, for this generation, until we change and get it right, their kids are not going to have a job?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ray, it's cause and effect . . . It's like turning around the QE II&mdash;you turn the wheel and ten miles away the ship starts to shift. I mean, that's what's happened with Australia, but the shift is on. I mean, we'll go through the 1990s as a low inflation economy with a cost of money, I think, mostly the same as the rest of world, with our debt stable in an internationalised place, with secure employment. Now that's eluded many countries; it will not elude Australia, not if we keep on the current path.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that that is what the Prime Minister said on 17 July 1990. If one looks at a speech by Graham Lee, the managing director of rating services for Standard and Poor's, on 14 September this year, one finds that he said about the current account:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the ratio of balance of payments on the current account to GDP, Australia ranked 49th of the 51 countries and we are aware that the position has deteriorated further over the past six months. On a rating category basis, Australia is in a very unfavourable position.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to ratio of net external debt to exports, Australia is ranked 47th of the 51 rated countries. Australia's position is very unfavourable.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the Prime Minister trying to get it right. We need to look a little further back to see what the government's intentions really were. I refer to the 1990-91 budget speech of the then Treasurer which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's task now is to build on that thrust towards a more balanced and independent economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight's Budget is about that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It builds on the fiscal achievements secured to date and maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt.</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened to overseas debt? In 1983 when this government came into office our net foreign debt was $23 billion. Today our net foreign debt is $180.484 billion. That figure is contained in a government document. So much for the commitment in 1981 to stabilise the debt. Since that period it has blown out quite substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at the government's contribution to debt growth in the form of Commonwealth debt. If you look at Commonwealth debt growth, you find, according to a Reserve Bank report of September 1995, that as at June 1995 our Commonwealth debt stood at $102 billion. In this year's budget the figure to service Commonwealth debt is $9.3 billion. In June 1990, the Prime Minister said in relation to government debt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years there will be no Government debt, domestic or external. It's an enormous claim that I can make on behalf of the government of Australia. I doubt there is any other OECD economy that will not have any bonds on issue at all.</PARA>
<PARA>What was government debt? Commonwealth government debt in June of 1990 was $49.5 billion. What is it today? It is $102 billion. Where did the money come from? This government ran budget deficits to the tune of $50 billion during that period. But there is a more interesting figure to look at. From the time this government came to office, in 1983, to 1995, interest paid on Commonwealth debt totalled $58.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in the first budget of the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, Paul Keating, brought down in 1983&mdash;the 1983-84 budget&mdash;total budget outlays were $57 billion. He has now spent more than his entire 1983 budget servicing Commonwealth debt. I remind the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that the then Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In three years there will be no Government debt, domestic or external.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it has gone up very substantially since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look further at the other component of the current account, and that is the net income deficit&mdash;the component that will service our external debt. Of the current account deficit of $27 billion, which is running at six per cent of gross domestic product, four per cent of GDP&mdash;$18.5 billion&mdash;is the net income deficit. It is the amount of money that in the main is servicing our overseas commitment. It is interesting to note what Max Walsh said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 22 June 1995. He was referring to an OECD outlook on the economy. In referring to that report, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provides probably the best measure of how Australia is rated by global financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It illustrates that despite all the spin and hype we have from Canberra we are regarded as being a mismanaged economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite true! The figures in fact back that up. Let us look at what the Prime Minister is saying. On 2 December 1992, when speaking about the economy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say any economy that can't travel at 4 per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away . . .  we ought to be able to run this economy at 4 per cent at least . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Why can we not run this economy at four per cent at least? We cannot run the economy at four per cent at least because of the high debt levels that we carry. You need only to look at the budget documents or your own FitzGerald report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot, on a sustainable basis, continue to finance the investment we need to grow over the 1990s, and into the new century, by going progressively further into foreign debt. We are already paying a significant premium on our borrowings and are becoming gradually more exposed to external shocks.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note the statements of the Prime Minister over that period, and of course his comments in Orange and on the radio this morning. He said:</PARA>

He was asked what he would do about the severe economic problems in Indonesia at the time.

My suggestion is that we get a decent Australian car behind it&mdash;a Holden or one of the Fords; perhaps a good Ford Falcon&mdash;and put up a modest poster on it saying, `This is a fully imported lorry of lies ahead of us. We have a few pamphlets here to comfort you in the extremity that you no doubt will feel when you are given this alarmist nonsense.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition was confronted by this $10,000 bunkum. What did he have to say about it? He definitely is getting into a very circumlocutory way of explaining himself. This is how he explained it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, it does not mean&mdash;given that&mdash;it gives the impression&mdash;I am not saying, and I never have, and I never will, that you, Tony Wright, and I&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the man who stands for absolute truth in Australian politics. He has had his party running around for the last two or three weeks talking about this $10,000 debt for every man, woman and child. I have just quoted the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party again repeating the $10,000 point. This is what the Leader of the Opposition says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not saying, and I never have, and I never will, that you, Tony Wright, and I, John Howard, personally owe any more money than we are personally contracted to. But in my view it is perfectly quite legitimate to express the nature of the debt and a per capita equivalent while acknowledging as I do that there is not a personal obligation beyond what you have personally incurred. But there is a personal consequence, and that is in the low interest rates you pay on the deficit you have impacted. And that is an inescapable link, and the link the government never wishes to abolish.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what on earth that means. What it actually seems to me to mean is that he does not want to be personally linked with the notion of $10,000 for every man, woman and child, which his deputy is saying, his lorry of lies is saying and various opposition spokespersons and members putting out guff and guggle around the electorate are saying. He does not want to connect himself with that sort of rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is now trying to say, `We were not talking about $10,000 for every man, woman and child.' The lorry of lies does not just say that. It ticks up an interest bill on all debt in the country, including foreign debt and government and privately owned debt. It suggests that the interest bill is what they are covering. In other words, they do not have to cover the capital; they have to cover the interest bill for every man, woman and child. So it works out that the interest bill is what we have to handle. The people who owe the money are basically in the private sector. The people who owe the money can own the capital in relation to debt. But the public now owns the interest bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that piece of nonsense gets challenged, they move over to say that it impacts upon mortgage rates. Somehow or other, by an extraordinarily abstract process, you finally get down to that point. They then no longer mention the $10,000. They say that it relates to interest rates. That is interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go through the statistics again, if foreign debt is the crucial factor in determining the level of interest rates. The opposition spokesman pointed out that, when we came into office, the levels of foreign debt were lower than they are now. That is true. Since that time, we have had a massive expansion in this economy. The growth rates have been two or three times the rate of growth that was experienced in the seven years prior to our getting into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had growth in employment that is two or three times what it has been previously. About 160,000 new jobs per year on average have been created in Australia since we have been in office. About 50,000 new jobs per year were created when the Leader of the Opposition was in office. That is three times the rate of that growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has become a country in which it is extraordinarily attractive for people to invest and want to lend money. We have been one of the growth leaders in the industrialised world. We have been one of the most attractive economies for foreign capital. We have always been a country that has been heavily dependent on foreign capital. We are now even more attractive to that capital because we are a well managed economy. Foreign capital does not chase badly managed economies. Get that fairly clear in your head. Foreign capitalists or money lenders do not wander around the place looking for poorly managed places upon which to dump money. That is not their way. They lend money to people who look as though they will be capable of sustaining it. They look at countries like ours and the way that they are managed. They come to the conclusion that we would be capable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is this argument that somehow or other the mortgage rates are determined by that level of foreign debt, we have to ask ourselves these questions: why were business and mortgage rates about 50 per cent higher when the Leader of the Opposition was in office than they are at this moment? Why was the current level of mortgage rates never got below in the entire time of the Leader of the Opposition's last term as Treasurer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If foreign debt was the determinant&mdash;and they are so proud that no foreign debt was around then&mdash;how come interest rates were higher when the Leader of the Opposition left office?

When the Leader of the Opposition left office the building society housing rate was 13.9 per cent; the current building society rate is 10.3 per cent.

Of course not: not a word. There were a few slogans and a few of the fabrications that relate to the lorry of lies that was outside yesterday. When it comes to the question of what should be done about it&mdash;is there a national plan to deal with it?&mdash;they refer to Dr Vince FitzGerald's report. But do they suggest whether they will support the government's initiatives to boost national savings or do they deal with some of the broader issues in terms of the economic competitiveness that the nation needs to face? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, on a day when we have a discussion about foreign debt and an opposition suggesting that there is no strategy to deal with savings, that one of the statistics the opposition speakers did not refer to was released today by the Statistician. It concerns the total value of assets, superannuation funds and approved deposit funds held in Australia and it is worth mentioning, even though it was not mentioned by the other side. For the June quarter we now have assets held in these deposits of $198 billion. How has that been achieved? It has been achieved fundamentally through the superannuation savings plan which the government has developed and refined over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a policy the opposition has never supported. At the last election, their approach was to freeze the superannuation guarantee at three per cent. We still do not know any policy detail of what their new policy might be. The only thing we have on the record up to date is they will now freeze the superannuation guarantee at six per cent. There is no bipartisan support for the measures we proposed in the budget which are designed to deal precisely with the issues that Dr FitzGerald referred to in his report to boost national savings through superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment made at budget time was that we recognised there were major challenges as far as the current account and as far as boosting national savings as a means of addressing those issues were concerned. We recognised that there were two ways we could go about dealing with that challenge&mdash;with a very major turnaround in the budget strategy with the budget surplus achieved this year and with a major structural surplus achieved in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we said we would introduce and add to the comprehensive superannuation arrangements. The superannuation guarantee arrangements that are already law provide for a phase in of employer contributions by way of superannuation for every worker to reach nine per cent by the year 2002. It is not something off in the future; it is already law and is being phased. It is already occurring. It is already at five to six per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Wentworth, who has spoken a bit about superannuation issues in the past, would do well to encourage the opposition to support such matters. He knows, as well as I do, that people in the financial industry with whom he has had some involvement in the past are urging the opposition to come out and give support to this as a clear means of boosting national savings in the strong national interest. But, of course, it has not come from the opposition. It has not occurred. The opposition has failed again to match the government's considered policy in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the government has made it clear that we will take steps to boost superannuation to 15 per cent for all Australian workers by the year 2000. That will achieve a massive national savings plan designed, first of all, to ensure a significant retirement incomes boost and an increase in living standards for all Australians in retirement as well as to play a major part in dealing with the current account problem, increasing national savings and, as a result of that, having discussions about foreign debt issues put back in their right perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will that do? Already the superannuation arrangements are adding half a per cent of GDP to savings as they stand at the moment with the five per cent to six per cent contribution rate that has been established by the government. By the year 2000, the net contribution of those arrangements to savings will be two per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have discussions about the level of interest rates and world competitiveness, clearly, in terms of turning around the current account issues with which the nation is faced, we can achieve a boost in national savings in a massive way&mdash;that is, a two per cent contribution to savings through the superannuation arrangements. The government is achieving that. The figures released today by the Statistician highlight the fact that already those arrangements are working well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can add that to the fact we have just chalked up 16 quarters of growth, a significant achievement in anyone's terms. OECD countries all around the world are still wringing their hands trying to find ways of getting three or four quarters of growth. The Japanese are still introducing stimuli packages&mdash;the third or fourth package&mdash;just to get a quarter of growth. Yet, after those 16 quarters of growth, what does the opposition have to say? They go around the country with this lorry of lies that, again, offers no prescription and no policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the opposition leader is asked to speak to major industry forums such as the Metal Trades Industry Association, what does he offer in policy terms? He says to them, `I have a lot of policies swimming around in my head that may dribble out at some point, depending on the circumstances.' In terms of public policy and public responsibility, what a disgrace for the alternative government to be indulging in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to foreign debt, given this matter of public importance, again, I think it is realistic to put it into some perspective and, first of all, indicate that the Commonwealth government's contribution to that foreign debt is four per cent. It is not the figures that were bandied around; it is four per cent. That is our contribution to the foreign debt and who owes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over most of Australia's history we have received a certain kind of investment because of the nature of our nation and the nature of developing overseas borrowings, which are part of the world competitive economy that we now have. Much of the foreign debt has been borrowed by private business. Naturally, that is what you would expect as businesses expand. They have invested not only here but also offshore. You have to balance the two issues if you are going to have a sensible discussion about the whole question of foreign investment in any event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the minister rightly points out, it is very hard to have a sensible discussion and engage the opposition on that basis. The fact is that, when it comes to the discussion about debt, much of it has been in that competitive industry, the development of industry in Australia and the development of companies that now have significant offshore assets. Much of the investment has been going into reinvestment capitalisation in Australia, but companies are also diversifying and playing their global role, which our policies have encouraged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go back 12 years to when the opposition was last in government, we had high tariffs and all of the protection. We did not have attempts by companies to participate in international business. That was not encouraged. We have had discussions about interest rates, but the fact is that in 1983 we had a highly regulated economy. Most Australians were starved of capital for homes through the normal interest rates that the banks were offering. In order to get housing loans, the vast majority had to go with a ration part of a bank loan and then top it up with a cocktail from some other financial intermediary, usually at interest rates three or four per cent higher than the prevailing interest rate. Finance companies were allowed to flourish because the banks were so highly regulated under opposition policy at that time. Not all of them did very well, but certainly those they served did not do very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have turned that situation significantly around. We now have an international economy that is competitive. Importantly, we have savings arrangements that are designed to be of significant benefit to all Australians. In 1983 less than 40 per cent of the population&mdash;the privileged few of the community essentially&mdash;got superannuation. Today 93 per cent of the population have superannuation coverage. It is boosting national savings precisely in the way which Dr FitzGerald said was critical when he produced that national savings report to the government in 1992. The net result is that superannuation assets today are $198 billion. Even if you have a discussion just on achievements to date, you have to compare those two amounts to give a fair reflection of what debt is. The opposition, rather than running around the country with this truck of garbage, would be better to focus on issues of real substance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 18th and 19th reports of the committee for 1995 relating to development of facilities for 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School, Townsville and air traffic control facilities for Darwin international airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, the committee's 18th report for 1995 relates to the proposed relocation of the 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School from Sydney to Townsville to meet operational and training requirements. The 10 Terminal Regiment provides the Army's terminal capability and most of its water transport capability. The Army Maritime School conducts individual training in maritime and terminal subjects, including maritime maintenance, and most of its effort supports the capability provided by the 10 Terminal Regiment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal will place the 10 Terminal Regiment close to its primary user, 3rd Brigade, which is located in Townsville, and will also allow for the vacation of current locations on Sydney Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal will provide office accommodation, instructional facilities, marine facilities, repair facilities and storage facilities. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $25.914m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vacation of the Sydney sites will allow Defence to rationalise its property holdings on the Sydney Harbour foreshore. The committee notes in relation to the land to be vacated by 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has given a commitment that any existing bushland will be retained in its natural state and incorporated in the Sydney Harbour National Park. The Chowder Bay site occupied by the Army Maritime School will not be developed for commercial purposes and a study is under way to determine what might happen to land that is not at the moment bushland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Activities of 10 Terminal Regiment involve terminal and watercraft operations which can be conducted anywhere within an area of operations. 10 Terminal Regiment provides the Army's terminal capability and most of its water transport capability. Terminal operations include the operation of road and rail terminals, military ports, and assistance in the operation of air terminals. In essence, terminal operations primarily involve the transhipment of cargo from one mode of transport to another. This includes the receipt, storage and in-transit handling of cargo as well as the transit of troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">10 Terminal Regiment has been substantially downsized and restructured under the recent force structure review and is currently dispersed over three sites in Sydney, and the unit must now concentrate to remain viable. The Army Maritime School has also been downsized as a consequence of the force structure review. Sharing of administrative support, maintenance and facilities with 10 Terminal Regiment on one site will provide additional manpower and administrative savings. Some $3 million in salaries, representing 59 positions, and administrative overheads can be saved annually if 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School can be concentrated onto the one site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preferred location and level of capability for 10 Terminal Regiment have been the subject of considerable review within Defence over the last five years. These reviews have supported the retention of the capability, albeit at a reduced level, and have recommended that the unit be located at Townsville. Additionally, in the course of project development the issue of location was further investigated and the alternative locations of Brisbane, Cairns, Mackay, other Sydney sites and Darwin were analysed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Townsville is the preferred location as it would allow the unit to concentrate, maximise operational and training opportunities, allow one embarkation point for navy support and reduce training and administrative overheads. Townsville is also a key defence base with a military infrastructure which can easily cater for the additional needs of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending that the project proceed the committee has acknowledged the efforts made by the Department of Defence to ensure that the proposal to locate the 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School on the Ross Island site at Townsville has minimal environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, because you are in the chair, I should mention that one of the tragedies that has happened in recent years to maritime support is that we no longer have the Larks, which you and I know used to go to Antarctica and did such valiant work there. Those who made the trip to Antarctica were well entertained by the Larkies. I understand that these have not been used for the last couple of years and so, as we lamented the passing of the dogs from Antarctica, I am sure we also lament the passing of the Larkies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move onto the committee's 19th report for 1995. It recommends the development of air traffic control facilities for Darwin International Airport. The proposal includes construction of an air traffic control tower, construction of an approach control building, provision of engineering services and site works. The estimated cost of the project is $8.4 million at May 1995 prices, with an outturn cost of $8.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence advised the committee that the need for a new air traffic control facility at RAAF base Darwin stems from several considerations. The existing control tower is in urgent need of repair and refurbishment, the location of the existing tower is incompatible with the future development of military facilities on the base, and the existing control tower is of insufficient height to provide full visibility to all aircraft movement areas and vital features. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structural damage caused to the control tower by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 was never fully repaired, and the likelihood of it surviving another major cyclone is debatable. Also, it lacks the post-disaster capability required for such a vital installation. This was almost needed last Monday night after the occurrence of an aftershock of an earthquake 500 kilometres away, which registered 6.4 on the Richter scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAAF has conducted a safety audit of air traffic control services at RAAF base Darwin. That safety audit revealed that safety features require improvement and that replacement of the air traffic surveillance radar and air communications equipment was crucial for continuing safe air traffic control operations at Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety audit concluded that the timing for the construction of a new air traffic control facility should be advanced to ensure that no disruption occurs to air traffic services, whilst allowing the efficient introduction into service of the new radar and communications equipment. At the public hearing, Defence advised that the safety audit identified a number of staffing weaknesses in the Darwin air traffic control services and that these had now been rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Siting of a new control tower midway along either the south or north side of the major runway was considered. A south side location was eliminated for these reasons: the buildings would be inside the large public building explosive ordnance safeguarding distance, glare from the early morning and late afternoon sun would severely degrade vision, and existing and planned airfield lighting would present more restrictions to night vision with a control tower on the southern site than on the northern site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four sites were considered on the northern side of the main runway, and a technical site selection board was convened to assess each location. All sites were in the general area north of the midpoint of the main runway and east of the FAC terminal and support buildings. In determining the preferred location, the board considered such issues as visibility of aircraft movement areas, height limitations, compatibility with future development and existing engineering and support services. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of a cabinet decision made yesterday, federal cabinet approved an independent review of the exemption that has thus far allowed tobacco advertising and sponsorship at 15 events, broadly described as international events. In so doing, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has granted an exemption for the Victorian Formula One Grand Prix to take place in my electorate in March next year. At the same time, the minister has imposed conditions that will require the standard health warnings on `on track' advertising and has banned peripheral advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, Dr Lawrence, has foreshadowed a review, by an independent committee, of the exemption provision that has permitted tobacco advertising at some 15 international events. The minister has made it clear that an independent review should mean the final elimination of tobacco advertising at international events. In the case of the Victorian grand prix, contractual arrangements were entered into by the Premier of Victoria which clearly contemplated tobacco advertising, and these agreements were made without any regard to the health issues involved and without any reference to the relevant federal minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that smoking is now on the increase with adolescent males, and the purpose of advertising at the grand prix is to increase this trend.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my constituents feel a real sense of disappointment because of yesterday's cabinet decision, and I would be failing as their federal member if I did not express my concern that this decision did not go far enough and add that, if in the public interest we are talking of inquiries, we need an inquiry into all aspects of the secret deals, the abuse of legal process and the deprivation of fundamental rights of citizens in my electorate that continues to flow from Premier Kennett's decision to form secret contractual arrangements which ultimately involve high levels of public expenditure which are kept secret from the Victorian parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier of Victoria, in his anxiety to accommodate the sponsors of the grand prix and those who may receive personal financial benefit, has indicated a total lack of regard for the health issues involved; for the rights of citizens whose properties have been damaged by compaction as a result of the laying of the track on what was once tranquil parkland, and for their rights to compensation, which have been severely limited; and for the rights of local school teachers and children who, due to anticipated noise levels, are to be forced to leave their schools during the grand prix and to date are awaiting confirmation that compensation will flow to them which will allow the children to be taken care of away from their own schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will recall, Mr Speaker, that earlier this year I raised in an adjournment debate the matter of the peculiar situation regarding the investment management arrangements for the Reserve Bank's superannuation fund&mdash;a fund called the Officers Superannuation Fund, or OSF. I pointed out that it seemed very strange in the first instance that a central bank, which has control over the movements in short-term interest rates, should in any way have control over the investment arrangements for its own superannuation fund. It would seem obvious on the face of it that there is at least a perception of a conflict of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, when I looked at it more carefully as a result of documents furnished to me by the Parliamentary Library, I found to my considerable surprise that the trustees of the OSF included some very senior officers of the Reserve Bank, and indeed beneath the trustees of the fund was an investment committee comprising, among others, the current assistant governor for financial markets, the previous assistant governor for financial markets, and an officer of the domestic markets department which has authority for trading the bank's own portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, when I looked at the way the various asset categories of this superannuation fund were managed, I was further surprised to discover that every portfolio, every asset category other than bonds, is managed by outside fund managers. For example, domestic shares, Australian equities, are managed by, among others, County Natwest, J.P. Morgan and Legal and General. The overseas equity portfolio is managed by Bankers Trust Funds Management, and the property portfolio&mdash;the fund also invests in property&mdash;is managed by Jones Lang Wootton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strange thing is that there is no description of an outside fund manager for the bond fund. You have to ask: why do they go to the trouble of employing outside fund managers to manage every other asset except bonds, when that is precisely the area where they have the most price sensitive information that is not available to the rest of the market?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After raising it on the adjournment I put some questions on notice. I asked in particular whether the bank had any written guidelines regarding potential conflicts of interest that may arise within the bank, because there is certainly the opportunity for a great number of them, given the nature of the bank's operations. Among the other answers that came back to that question was a statement saying that the OSF investment committee acts only on the basis of information which is available generally to the market. That struck me at first as very odd if the senior officers of the bank who participate in making these investment decisions are, in the course of their duties, acquiring price sensitive information. That is quite clear from, among other things, the text of a book written by Joan Linklater, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside the Bank</EMPHASIS>&mdash;written, I might add, with the imprimatur of the bank. The foreword to it is written by Mr Phillips, a former deputy governor of the bank. The author says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bank's senior management is privy to the policy priorities of, and pressures on, the Government, to Treasury pursuits, and to the concerns and directions of the major central banks. The Bank also has access to aggregated financial information not available, or available only later, to others.</PARA>
<PARA>So these senior officers who are sitting on this investment committee must by virtue of their other duties be in possession of information that is not available to the market. Yet in the answer to this question we are asked to believe by assertion that somehow or other when they make their investment decisions about their bond fund they suddenly block out the rest of that information; they somehow divide within their brain the information which is available to the rest of the market, which they may read in the newspapers, and that which they gain in the course of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement, I believe, is an impossibility. You cannot imagine that in pursuing their duty as trustees&mdash;duties which require them to act in the best interest of the members of the fund&mdash;they are somehow excluding from their decision making process information which is price sensitive and which is not available to the rest of the market. I remain to be convinced of the veracity of this answer. </PARA>

<TITLE>Diesel Fuel Rebate</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1532" SPEAKER="Simmons The Hon D.W." NAMEID="FJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CALARE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Calare)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak about changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme as it applies to domestic users from 1 July this year. The 1995-96 budget tightened the rules on who is eligible to claim the diesel fuel rebate. In particular, it restricted the agricultural and mining usage that will qualify for the rebate and removed the rebate for residential usage unless it is connected to agricultural and mining operations. It is the second of these two points that I wish to deal with today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will dramatically inconvenience a very small proportion of the community, but it is not the number of people that counts; it is how it will affect them that matters, in my view. With the removal of the rebate for residential usage, those currently using diesel fuel will have two options: either pay hundreds of extra dollars per year, which the removal of the rebate will cost them, or change over to natural gas or electricity, which will cost them between $2,000 and $3,000. That is a cost that is beyond the ability of most of those people to pay. Besides, many people in rural areas do not and cannot have access to natural gas due to the costs involved in laying down gas main pipelines. This leaves many people with just one option&mdash;to pay dramatically higher fuel bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people affected by this is small, and the saving that will be made by the government in removing their rebate is certainly not large. In Calare, my electorate, some 220 households are claiming that rebate. The same saving as will be made by removing the rebate is in the vicinity of $120,000 per annum. That is not very substantial, given the inconvenience and the financial difficulty this decision will cause those 220 households in my electorate and the people using diesel fuel in other centres across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A constituent who lives in the city of Orange wrote to me a few weeks ago about this issue and mentioned the distress that it will cause him and others. He is in the position of having his fuel bills increased by about $500 per year by the removal of the rebate. He cannot get gas because the gas company says the pipeline installation will cost too much. He is therefore in a situation where he needs a capital outlay of approximately $10,000 to replace his diesel boiler, or pay the extra $500 per year in fuel costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes on in his letter to point out, quite correctly, that the government already receives a substantial tax on  diesel apart from the rebate. Furthermore, this is a cost specific only to those who use diesel for home electricity and heating. There is no extra charge&mdash;as the removal of the rebate amounts to&mdash;being placed on electricity or gas. It is only those who use diesel fuel who must pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protecting the environment cannot be used as an argument in favour of this move. Wood-fired heaters are hardly environmentally friendly. The amount of smoke that wood fires pump into the air, and the resulting effect on the quality of that air, is quite dramatic, as most city dwellers will have noticed. I remind honourable members just to look towards the southern parts of this national capital in wintertime to attest to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the government to re-examine the changes as they affect such residential users of diesel fuel. The time frame for the introduction of this legislation should be extended. From budget night in early May to 1 July 1995 is hardly sufficient time for people who were even prepared to change to alternative forms of energy. At the very least, if the government is going to change the rules overnight, I believe it should be prepared to assist residential users to meet the additional costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, the government was very happy to assist to the tune of millions of dollars those people who are affected by aircraft noise near Sydney airport. I was pleased to see that. I trust that, following my representations, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) is prepared to ask cabinet to re-examine this issue because of the obvious hardship and distress caused to people living in cold climatic areas such as the central tablelands of New South Wales and other cold areas of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening in the adjournment debate I want to bring to the attention of the House another success story in my electorate that had its base back in the days of decentralisation under the former coalition government in New South Wales prior to the Wran government coming to power. Just recently a company in my electorate at Taree, Goninan's Lansdowne Engineering plant, has been part of a winning tender to build the new rail locomotives for the National Rail Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year in debate in this House it was mentioned that Goninan's had been selected as the preferred tenderer for 120 diesel locomotives. It was announced last week that the company has won the tender. A lot of that work is going to be undertaken at the Lansdowne Engineering plant in Taree. In this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manning River Times</EMPHASIS> we saw the headline `Taree a big winner with rail contract'. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taree will be a big winner following the signing in Newcastle on Monday of a $700 million contract to supply National Rail Corporation with new locomotives and the maintenance of them for the next 15 years . . . Taree manager, Mr John Janik, said Taree will benefit enormously from the contract and it will allow the company to contract out work to other firms.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment will benefit at the plant as the 90 employees taken on this year will be staying on, bringing our workforce up from 217 at the beginning of the year to 300 now.</PARA>
<PARA>It has reassured those people of their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of my address I mentioned that this particular plant had its start under a decentralisation program in the early 1970s when Grasslands relocated out of Sydney and built this plant in Taree, identifying a stable labour market in the area as one of the main reasons for decentralising. It ultimately became Napier Grasslands and was still manufacturing farm machinery. It is now part of the Goninan's group, known as Lansdowne Engineering, employing a work force of around 300 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, they have been manufacturing some bogies for rail networks and dump truck bodies and buckets for earthmoving equipment in the mining industry. With this contract, John Janik and his crew from Goninan in Taree will ensure employment and an inflow of capital into the Manning Valley well into the future. I would like the House this evening to congratulate John and the other people at Goninan for the work that they are doing and the faith that they have placed in the work force and the community in the Manning Valley. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to use the opportunity provided in the adjournment debate to comment on the opposition blunderbuss that wandered aimlessly through the suburbs of Brisbane, including those in my electorate, desperately trying to find some young people to talk to. But the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) effectively lampooned this pathetic opposition attempt in question time today, so I do not need to talk about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about the great opportunity I had as part of the parliamentary delegation visiting Europe in the last fortnight to campaign on Australia's behalf against French nuclear testing. It was a great honour to be able to represent my electorate, the people of Moreton and the people of Queensland, on this delegation and to put Australia's case most firmly as to why we are so strongly opposed to nuclear testing in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Moreton and the people of Queensland have been particularly strong in their expressions of outrage about this, and with every justification. So it was a great opportunity for me to be able to speak on their behalf in France and through other capitals in Europe to make sure that their voice was being heard where the decisions were going to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often in this parliament that both the opposition and the government are able to work as closely together as we did on this delegation. It was also an honour to be on a delegation with members from the opposition, the government and the Australian Democrats from the Senate, because we spoke as one voice. We were a very effective delegation because of that. We had on the delegation for the first week the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). The other members on the delegation were the members for Chifley (Mr Price), Mayo (Mr Downer), New England (Mr Sinclair), me and Senator Vicki Bourne from the Australian Democrats, who is a New South Wales senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us worked very effectively as a team putting the case most strongly to the French and the governments in a number of other capitals. We visited nine capital cities in 10 days. On every occasion, we were able to put a very unified point of view. That had a very important effect on the people of Europe. This delegation did represent 100 per cent of Australian political opinion, and that has had an important impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were arguing on two principal concerns. They were the only two issues that we were concerned about. The first and most important was the impact of this French nuclear testing on the cause of disarmament and trying to achieve a nuclear weapons free world, which I believe the people of the world actually want. What the French have done in their decision has been to give comfort to these people in the threshold states, such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea&mdash;we now believe that Pakistan has nuclear weapons&mdash;in having nuclear weapons. The French decision takes the heat off those countries. We and the Western alliance now do not have the moral supremacy and the power of argument to say that they should not be engaged in nuclear weapons production. That is the most alarming thing about the action of the French. They have weakened our case to try to stop those threshold countries from developing nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and equally important issue that we were campaigning on was the impact of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific on the environment for the people of the South Pacific. One thing we made very clear was that, although people think that Mururoa, being 6,000-odd kilometres away from Australia, is a long way away, when you test nuclear weapons in a marine environment any radiation leakage from that atoll that goes into the South Pacific and pollutes the South Pacific will be shared by all the nations of the South Pacific. All of us will suffer from the environmental damage that is caused by any radiation leakage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of if radiation leaks from the atoll but when. That is what the Australian and New Zealand scientists have found and that was the very strong message we delivered throughout the capitals of Europe. We got very strong support from the people of Europe. They, like us, including the people of France, are outraged at the French government decision. The French people do not support their government in this action. We should be aware of the fact that the peoples of the world do not support what some individual governments might be doing in continuing to develop nuclear weapons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to finish a speech that I started before. Let me recap some of the points I made earlier. I was speaking about my visit to French Polynesia to protest against the nuclear testing on the Mururoa Atoll. The point was that I was arrested and yesterday one of the students there came through here. I was fortunate enough to be able to take him to the department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) so that they could speak and clarify exactly who caused the riots at the Faa'a airport. They confirmed that the French fired upon women and children first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are three factors we need to remember&mdash;the three lessons that I learned from that trip. Firstly, as one of the previous speakers said, we must continue to take all possible methods to object to the French and their continued use of the South Pacific as their testing zone. Secondly, after seeing what I saw of the French police, the French military and the authorities and the way that they treat their own citizens, I have grave concerns for the Moahi people and what will happen to them when all the politicians and media have left. Whilst I was still in French Polynesia, they said that there will be retribution and I believe that the French will take out their retribution on those defenceless people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media, quite foolishly, put all their video cameras through the French military base to get it out to the rest of the world. I am quite sure that what will happen will be that they will take note of the faces and the names and these people will disappear in the middle of the night. It is important that Amnesty International, the United Nations and all human rights groups make sure that these peoples' continued human rights are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we can do something about it. South Africa was stopped by the people of the world using their wallets without the guns. We can do this by doing the same with the French. Each of us seems powerless on our own, but if we combine our purchasing power and decide never to buy French goods again, then I believe that Jacques Chirac and the people who back him, the business people of France, will come to heel and force him to stop what is a most inhumanitarian hostile act towards the rest of world opinion. </PARA>
