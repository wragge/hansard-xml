<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to present the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration's inquiry into the impact of the taxation regime on the tourism industry. The report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>, explores the links between the taxation system and an industry which has emerged as one of the country's most vibrant and viable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years ago tourism would have been regarded as a promising fledgling industry. Today, following a rapid period of development, it is a multibillion dollar sector of the economy comprising a wide variety of businesses, providing income for hundreds of thousands of people and contributing enormously to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation has come about for a number of reasons. Tourism has profited from the technological advancements which have made travel, particularly long haul, safer and more comfortable; travellers, both at home and abroad, have more leisure time and disposable income; and there have been efficient and successful campaigns to promote Australia's natural advantages and attractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, tourism has benefited from significant government support. This has been provided in a variety of ways such as the provision of services and infrastructure, funding for the programs administered by the Commonwealth Department of Tourism and other tourism bodies, and access to various government assistance schemes. The outcome of these combined factors has been that Australia has become an increasingly popular destination in the world tourism market, resulting in more jobs, rapid development and a highly sustainable tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of this desirable situation and the encouragement of the resulting business investment and economic advantages are high on the government's list of priorities. In recognition of this, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) referred the matter to the committee in March 1994. The subsequent inquiry and this report should provide a clear signal to the tourism and business communities of a continuing commitment to the development and health of tourism in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report addresses three terms of reference which required the committee to examine the level of taxation levied on the tourism industry with a view, firstly, to assessing whether the taxation regime impacts unfairly on tourism relative to other industries and, secondly, to identifying any inequities relative to other industries in the application of specific taxation measures to the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the third term of reference the committee was required to establish whether the taxation regime places Australia's tourism industry at a competitive disadvantage relative to the taxation regime of competitor countries. In undertaking this inquiry the committee considered a broad range of issues and was able, in the course of many informal, wide ranging discussions as well as from submissions and public hearings to learn the views of very many people across the spectrum of tourism interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became apparent early in the inquiry process that there were several basic considerations essential to an effective exploration of the tourism-taxation nexus. Primary among these was that an inquiry such as this could only be carried out if it were predicated upon the principles of good taxation. Hence there is no aspect of the report which does not take as its basic reference point the precepts of equity, efficiency and simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that this inquiry, in considering the business of tourism in the light of these criteria, has found no evidence that the industry has been targeted specifically or unfairly by the taxation regime. Nor, again on grounds of equity, efficiency and simplicity, could the committee at any stage see a case for recommending special treatment for tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the committee was concerned to note that there are areas where, as part of a relatively young industry, tourism businesses have been put at a disadvantage by not having access to taxation benefits and concessions which have historically been available to older and better established industries. In addition, anomalies have arisen in the application of taxation measures which have placed tourism in a less favourable situation than certain other sectors of the economy. Thus the committee found that in many cases the principles of good taxation often do not apply across the board in respect of tourism operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which confronted the committee in the preliminary stages of the inquiry, and which continued to be an issue, was the paucity of reliable, practical statistical data on the tourism industry. There is little doubt that greater precision could have been applied to certain aspects of this inquiry had such data been available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this certainly constituted a problem for the committee, it is a far greater one for the tourism industry as a whole which will require access to good, sound economic data if it is to keep apace of competitors in the international market. The committee thus had no hesitation in recommending that the Australian Bureau of Statistics be provided with the funding to enable it to allocate more resources for the collection and quantifying of data on tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first task of the committee was to identify and examine those taxation measures which are perceived by participants in the industry as being most onerous for tourism businesses. Foremost among these are various income tax issues, fringe benefits tax and wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the income tax concerns raised most frequently before the committee were regulations governing allowable tax deductions incurred in deriving income, and capital gains provisions. The many organisations and individuals who made strong representations to the committee regarding these issues emphasised the clear link between fair taxation, healthy investment and the continued development of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were several instances, for example, where the committee considered that insufficiently generous depreciation provisions may constitute an obstacle to investment. It has accordingly recommended the expansion of depreciation provisions in respect of certain items of plant and equipment, vehicles used exclusively for earning assessable income, and landscaping and outdoor recreation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further income tax issue was raised by the Australian Casino Association which is concerned about the proposed income tax liability of non-resident group promoters, or `junket operators'. These promoters are paid commissions to bring international `high rollers' to Australian gaming facilities. The association fears that taxing junket operators would result in Australian casinos losing their share of the lucrative junket market and a consequent serious loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While agreeing with the association that there would be revenue implications not only for casinos but also for federal and state governments, the committee was unable adequately to assess the merits of the case. This was largely due to an insufficiency of information and the failure of the casinos to present a comprehensive and coordinated case to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of what it heard, though, the committee did consider that it would be inadvisable for the ATO to proceed on this matter without knowing, for example, the taxation treatment of such operators in other countries and without an assessment of the potential impact of such a taxation measure on federal, state and local government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On these grounds, the committee has urged that Treasury and the ATO investigate these matters further before any decision is made concerning the taxing of non-resident group promoters. If this process is to be effective, it is essential that all casinos and the Australian Casino Association participate cooperatively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Hotels Association brought to the committee's attention the income tax anomaly created by the application of the principle of mutuality to the taxation of clubs and similar associations. This provides taxation exemptions for some clubs which unfairly disadvantages similar but non-exempt enterprises, such as hotels. In the interests of encouraging a more equitable situation, the committee has recommended that the mutuality principle be subjected to examination by the Treasurer and the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of particular and serious concern across the whole tourism spectrum was fringe benefits tax. The committee welcomed the recent government initiatives on the matter of compliance costs but felt that the application and impact of FBT warrant further review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area where a number of inequities have arisen is in the wholesale sales tax regime. The committee heard evidence from a wide variety of tourism operators concerning the application of sales tax to such disparate items as bareboats and tourism promotion literature. The committee's hands were tied with regard to this matter by the lack of practical suggestions for reforming WST while at the same time minimising compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most conspicuously anomalous situations for tourism operators identified by the committee was that relating to the diesel fuel rebate scheme which does not generally apply to tourism operations. It seemed to the committee that the lack of a guiding rationale for the scheme has contributed to the inequities inherent in it, including the ineligibility for rebate of tourism operators off the national grid who use diesel for electricity generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was impressed by the evidence presented and the number of constructive suggestions received on this topic and has recommended that the scheme be reviewed to clarify its objectives and that alternatives to the scheme be investigated to ensure greater equity for all users of diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also gave a considerable amount of attention to the issue of tourism shopping. Given the amount of foreign exchange earned by tax and duty free shopping, the committee regards this an important sector of the tourism industry. It has, consequently, made a number of recommendations aimed at improving tourism shopping for travellers and the operators of tax and duty free stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter brought to the committee's attention was the increasing application of user charging in the tourism industry. The validity of this in many cases is acknowledged; nevertheless, the committee is concerned to ensure that user pays measures conform with the principles of good taxation: that is, they should be kept to a minimum and should be transparent in application. User charging should also relate to the cost of the service provided and beneficiaries of such charges should be clearly identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something on which the committee was not able to make any conclusive judgement was the inquiry's third term of reference. This was to examine whether, in comparison with the taxation regimes of competitor countries, the Australian taxation regime places tourism at a competitive disadvantage. Such a question cannot be addressed only in reference to taxation. Taxation regimes and government policy vary enormously from one country to another. In addition, industry profitability is influenced by many factors other than taxation, including currency exchange rates, market demand, security considerations and wage rates. It was not within the committee's capacity to conduct the sort of international comparative survey required to tackle this term of reference in any depth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's examination of the effects of the taxation regime on tourism businesses has been wide ranging, encompassing all sectors of the industry, and has addressed an extensive range of issues. We have tried to take all points of view into account and to take the most balanced approach to the problems presented to us and to provide the most practical and workable solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of two matters of dissent, the report has the support of the whole committee. I take this opportunity to thank the members of the committee for their unfailingly diligent efforts towards its production. I would also like to express the committee's appreciation to the individuals, organisations, government departments and agencies which supplied valuable information and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the secretariat and particularly acknowledge the fine work of our adviser from the Department of Tourism, Ms Alison Allcock. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, I would like to join the chairman, initially, in commending members of the secretariat for their assistance during the inquiry process and in producing the report. I especially express my appreciation to Alison Allcock from the Department of Tourism for her involvement during the inquiry. I also express my appreciation to Patti Tancred, Chris Paterson and Margaret Cahill. I pay tribute to the chairman, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons). As a former Minister for Tourism, his experience of, and genuine interest in, the industry was a real plus for the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail of this report will be widely read. Even the cover is arresting. The name <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS> is a tribute to Patti in the secretariat. It shows quite a good deal of imagination and creativity and I expect the committee will see more of that in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman has said, this has been an important inquiry. It has quite properly, and not before time, set the scene for some changes to the tax regime as it impacts on the tourism industry, which will further enhance the capacity of this industry to make an even greater contribution to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry has not in the past sought, nor has it received, preferential treatment. Unlike other industries, it has not been heavily subsidised. It has grown to a large extent because of the belief of those in the industry&mdash;initially not great in number&mdash;that Australia was a great tourism product not only for international consumers but also for Australians who have traditionally preferred to travel overseas rather than experience the marvels of our own country first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry has not been predominantly about arguing for special treatment for the tourism industry&mdash;although there are arguments that its importance and potential might justify that. It has been about fairness. The tourism industry is totally justified in its claim to be one of Australia's export industries. The corollary of that is that it deserves to be treated at least comparably with other export industries. It has become clear through this inquiry that it has not always been treated consistently or fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarkable thing about the tourism industry is that it has grown despite such treatment. It has been successful in an international environment which is not always a level playing field. It has contended with the vagaries of volatile exchange rates. It has survived recessions and pilot strikes. It has been a leader in industrial relations reform, although there is potential for even greater gains in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the long process of this inquiry one was left with the impression that the tourism industry is a model industry, consisting mainly of small businesses, and is only just beginning to reach maturity. It has enormous potential. In an electorate like mine, where our economy is totally tourism dominated, it is quite evident that this industry has the capacity to provide jobs, particularly to the young people who still bear the brunt of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the industry will only reach its potential if it is treated with respect by governments. It does not want anything else. Although, as the chairman pointed out, it has received assistance from government, it does not want too much help from government. It wants not to be hindered by government. It certainly does not want to be regarded as a milch cow by government. That is the bottom line of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other impression one is left with at the end of this inquiry is the overall deficiency of the Australian tax system. Our tax system's complexity and anomalous structure clearly impacts on all businesses, including those in the tourism industry. The arguments for a complete overhaul of the tax system are incontrovertible. The Australian tax system is outmoded; it is a patchwork of inconsistencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has grappled with that fact, and with some of those inconsistencies, by making specific recommendations in respect of the fringe benefits tax and the payroll tax. Unfortunately, we did not see our way clear to really come to grips with obvious weaknesses of the wholesale sales tax, which, I accept, was not entirely within our terms of reference. But it has become obvious that the wholesale sales tax is quite inadequate as a tax in the current international climate. Not only is it ad hoc, it is a tax the whole rationale of which is flawed. The wholesale sales tax is simply not capable of meeting the requirement for a more even-handed business tax treatment for all activities in Australia. The committee also noted that we have to contend with three tiers of government, each of which impose taxes and charges on business. This we regarded as being something of a threat to the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its deliberations the committee had to contend with what has become a whole new era of user pays. However, we have expressed concern about the proliferation of such charges, as they are euphemistically called. We have recognised in our report that it may be easier for authorities to impose user pays rather than take the harder political option of reducing expenditure or increasing existing taxes. We made a very important recommendation in respect of such taxes as bed taxes, which unfairly single out the accommodation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am personally disappointed that the committee was not prepared to seek a re-examination of the tax deductibility of entertainment expenses. In my view, it was clearly demonstrable that the reintroduction of tax deductibility for entertainment expenses, with proper substantiation, not only was fair but also would generate employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government will react swiftly to this report and its recommendations, even in the context of the present budget deliberations. I realise that those deliberations are well advanced and that we may get the initial response from the government that this report is too late for consideration in the present budgetary context. However, I believe that time is of the essence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has done an excellent job in highlighting issues and making recommendations which are eminently supportable and, in many cases, not extremely expensive, and which go a long way towards enhancing the ongoing viability of the tourism industry. I should observe that many of the recommendations will impact favourably on my own constituents, so I have a vested interest in challenging the government to act immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent experience in Australia has demonstrated that no aspect of political reform is more difficult than taxation reform. Public opinion in the mid-1980s, and again at the 1993 federal election, demonstrated an aversion to the introduction of a new broad based indirect tax regime. Consequently, and unlike other OECD nations, Australia is likely to maintain a relatively narrow indirect tax base with no value added tax or general retail tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This opinion is reflected in the report of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>. It is a good thing because policy makers should be in the business of making the Australian tax system more progressive, not more regressive. This matches the record of the federal government. The abolition of tariff walls in Australia lowered the equivalent of regressive taxes&mdash;a regressive pricing impost on working-class consumers in Australia&mdash;just as competition policies are about to convert the $8.2 billion of GBE dividends in Australia, regressive pricing policies, into lower prices for customers. The government, across the board in tariff policy and public sector competition policy, has been against a more regressive tax and charges regime in Australia. I am pleased that the committee's report endorses that record and approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emergence and growth of the Australian tourism industry over the last decade has coincided with government attempts to rationalise the taxation system. As a result, tourism has not enjoyed the range of tax breaks and concessions historically available to emerging industries in Australia. Nonetheless, it is difficult in 1995 to argue for special tax breaks and concessions for tourism. The interests of tax equity would be better served by closing down inappropriate concessions in other industries. At least then tourism could be guaranteed a level playing field and intersectoral equity in tax policy. It is no longer possible to argue a case for tourism as an infant industry in Australia. Any industry growing quickly and accounting for almost six per cent of GDP hardly requires special tax exemptions to preserve its economic position. I am happy to report that, from my experience on the committee, this is a view well understood within the tourism industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax burden placed on tourism has a relatively limited impact on the expenditure decisions of tourists. Moreover, as a substantial proportion of the Australian tourism industry involves international visitors&mdash;representing 30 per cent of tourism expenditure and expected to increase to 50 per cent by the year 2005&mdash;important equity and revenue collection goals can be met by maintaining a robust taxation regime in tourism. From this perspective, a desirable policy goal may well be to shift the incidence of tourism taxes from domestic to international tourists. For example, it would be more equitable and efficient to raise additional revenue from increases in the international passenger processing charge than from a new bed tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equity and efficiency arguments rest with shifting the incidence of tourism taxes from domestic to international tourists. For example, lifting the international charge from $27 to $81 would raise an additional $242 million per annum, which is the amount that academics, journalists&mdash;not government members&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of employment. Tourism plays a very important role in the Australian economy in the generation not only of national employment but, more particularly, of regional employment. Over the last 15 years in this country, we have seen a loss of labour intensive work in the non-traded sector due to the exposure of manufacturing industries and government business enterprises to both international and domestic competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism has a very important role in regional centres in replacing those jobs lost with new labour intensive forms of non-traded work. In this respect, government policy should move from subsidising declining industries in regional Australia to effective infrastructure support and efficient taxation policies for the growth of industries such as tourism. In this respect, the government should examine the issue of infrastructure funding and its taxation treatment in the tourism industry. Tourism&mdash;especially in isolated areas&mdash;depends extensively on the public provision of transport links. There may be advantages to the public sector in creating an integrated tax vehicle, such as the extension of the infrastructure bonds dealing with the concurrent construction of tourism facilities and associated infrastructure access by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, with the proliferation of capital intensive industries through the use of advanced information technology, it is absurd for state governments throughout Australia to be taxing labour inputs with payroll taxes. These taxes discriminate against labour intensive enterprises and encourage employers to minimise labour inputs. It is estimated that the elimination of state payroll taxes would produce a 1.5 per cent increase in the rate of national employment. The cost of federal compensation for this initiative is about $7.5 billion, which is the equivalent of 55 per cent of the value of concessions set out in the 1994 tax expenditures statement. I am pleased to see and totally support the committee's recommendation in referring this matter to COAG via the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other cabinet ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I join with the committee's chairperson, the member for Calare (Mr Simmons), in thanking other committee members for their cooperation throughout the inquiry and, in particular, thanking members of the secretariat for their outstanding research and cooperation with the committee. </PARA>

Obviously, the major and many minor players in Australian tourism took the same view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a reference and review necessarily raises expectations of witnesses or participants for constructive and positive change. A committee which then does not adequately report and recommend on the basis of the evidence given fails in its responsibilities to the participants who committed time and resources to the review. The terms of reference required the committee to examine the impact of taxation on the tourist industry that places it at a disadvantage to the taxation regimes of competitor countries. From the evidence, I believe that our indirect taxation in its many forms places great burdens and operating costs on Australian tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee may have acted outside its terms of reference on payroll tax&mdash;that is recommendation No. 26&mdash;but members unanimously agreed that payroll tax acted substantially to diminish opportunities not only in tourism but in other industries. This recommendation is a significant attempt to remove the most discriminatory labour cost to the tourism industry and other industries in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two specific matters that I wish to address. One is the dissenting report, with my Liberal colleagues, on the tourist charter vessel operators. The other is my own dissenting report on indirect taxation. The situation of imposing WST on buses and vessels in the tourist industry which hold less than 12 persons and with unscheduled departures is inequitable. It is an example of an indirect tax introduced initially when the tourist industry was in its infancy. Consequently, it does not enjoy the broad exemptions granted in primary, mining and manufacturing industries. This is confirmed by the Commonwealth Department of Tourism in paragraph 2.24 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 5.14 of the report substantiates evidence given that a boat building factory at Airlie Beach had closed largely as a result of the inability of the bareboat industry to implement its fleet replacement program because of WST. Recommendation No. 11 suggests there should be an exempt basis of WST for business buses and vehicles which hold less than 12 persons on the basis of consultation with the Transport Ministers Council. The dissenters see no difference in the activities of the bareboat charter industry, which is servicing the same market, the same people, the same industry, yet we have recommended no exemption for them. Our opinion for this view and our recommendation are included in the dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, my dissenting report calls for a comprehensive review of the indirect taxation arrangements which, I believe, is a natural conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence given to the committee on all forms of indirect taxation. I will read into evidence some of those comments. Paragraph 2.23 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our indirect tax system `is narrowly based with many concessions and exemptions, and as a result often involves very high ad valorem-equivalent rates'. This would suggest that our taxation system has unequal effects on providers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>Further down in the report the following suggestion is made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A zero rating for exports would ensure that the exported component of tourism is internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>I share some of the concerns and disappointment that have been expressed already, but in this regard I believe the conclusions are obvious and I am disappointed that my colleagues could not join me in this conclusion. Concern about indirect taxation was not limited to sales tax but also the diesel fuel rebate scheme, payroll tax, tourism, shopping and indirect taxation of exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that 30 per cent of Australian tourism is international&mdash;and increasing&mdash;I have no doubt that any tourist operation in Australia which is competing internationally is disadvantaged where Australian business costs include forms of business tax in comparison with a competing country where payroll tax is not assessed and where VAT is applicable. A major review was suggested in the Commonwealth white paper for the 1985 taxation summit. In truth, GST option C was rejected by political parties for political reasons. This is hardly a substantial basis on which to deny a review of the indirect taxation system 10 years later, at a time when the WST has been expanded and, consequently, the complications and inequities always inherent in the WST have been expanded. The WST now imposes substantial costs, both in tax and compliance, on businesses in Australia. Surely, after 10 years there is a need to look at the alternatives that may have been applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has accepted in part the removal of payroll tax, which was part of the coalition's Fightback package, but has declined to recommend a major review of the indirect taxation system which, in evidence, became the major taxation problem of the tourist industry. To decline to recommend it on the basis of political attitudes is perpetuating the problem that is inherent in the whole system of indirect taxation in Australia and which is in need of major reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the report of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>, may I also extend my congratulations to the chairman, the member for Calare (Mr Simmons), and members of the secretariat for the tremendous work they did on this very comprehensive review of tourism and the taxes the industry has to pay. One of the points I would like to highlight, and which I do not think has been mentioned at this stage, comes through in recommendation 1 of the committee, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in consultation with the Bureau of Tourism Research and other interested organisations, be provided with the resources to develop a statistical system for quantifying the significance of tourism in Australia as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA>It has often been said that there is no industry in Australia that has more statistics available to it than the tourist industry. I think that is right. It is also true to say that it is very difficult for committees such as this to meet and try to analyse what is really the story. It is not a problem that faces just Australia. Worldwide, people are trying to get a grip on what tourism is all about. It has proved to be very difficult. Whether it be the World Tourism Organisation, the World Travel and Tourism Council, the Canadian government or this government, at least efforts are now being made to get a definition of the size of the industry, what composes that industry and what that industry is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the very good recommendations that come through this report, that is one of the difficulties that has faced us in Australia. If the government accepts nothing more than that one recommendation, we would at least have the opportunity to have a real understanding of what this tremendous industry is all about. It is true that the tourist industry has never been looking for special treatment. It wants equitable treatment; it does not want to be a special case&mdash;and neither does it need to be. There has been tremendous development in the industry over the last 10 to 15 years. Some of it has been by very good management; some has been by very heavy promotion overseas; and some has been by good luck. But the one thing that comes through all the time is that tourism is a very competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we can specifically take out points in this report on what should happen in general areas, in actual fact, the world tourist industry does not quite work like that. When people sit down and plan a holiday they do not really want to know whether or not there is a five per cent bed tax or a 10 per cent sales tax on the bed, whether there is an arrival tax or a departure tax, whether there is an agricultural handling fee, whether there is a tax on rent-a-cars at the airport and whether or not there is an anti-leprosy tax or some other obscure tax that the government might have invented. What they are looking for is the total cost of the holiday. In that respect, I think our taxation people have always got to be mindful when they do impose a tax on some of these extracurricular activities that they never destroy the competitiveness of the ultimate product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody should be under the misapprehension that I would advocate no tax for international tourists. But, if we are going to get into this industry in a very real way and if we are going to reap the true potential that it offers Australia in terms of income and jobs, we must make absolutely sure that our taxation system is well rounded and moulded to the extent we are not disadvantaged in the competition for overseas visitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has not come through, I do not think, in this report&mdash;because the report was not designed to do that&mdash;is the tremendous challenge that is facing Australia over these next five to 10 years. Some of the projections of organisations like the World Travel and Tourism Council are really quite startling, because by the end of this decade you could have 140 million people travelling around Asia on annual holidays. That is an enormous figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia got one per cent of that business on top of that which we have at the moment, we would find it very difficult indeed to be able to handle some of that business. I think we have to realise two things: firstly, we have to make sure that the system is such that we can get our infrastructure into place; and, secondly and most importantly, when we go for that huge, potential market out there, we have the right to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is just one more thing that I would like to raise. The report includes a couple of very worthy recommendations that I hope the government will look at very closely indeed. One recommendation covers the whole area of tourism shopping, and duty-free shopping in particular. So much of the expenditure of the tourism dollar revolves around shopping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) would know that one of the major shopping centres in Australia is in his electorate. That shopping centre in fact took the challenge of the alleged operations of some inbound tourist operators who were diverting tourists into specific shops. They went into the business of inbound tourism. The shopping centre in the honourable member's electorate is one of the few areas where you can really get a true indication of what tourism spending is all about and a true indication of what tourists buy. It is quite fascinating when you look at the initial analysis that has been done by that centre to note that baby clothing, large tins of instant coffee, gems and precious stones are amongst the largest expenditures by international visitors to the Gold Coast. Nobody has ever picked that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet when we go to the duty-free stores we really do see a fairly limited range of what is available. A lot of people have this hang-up about duty-free shopping. The reality is that it is part of international tourism, it is part of international travel, and one of the recommendations has been that we look at this whole area to see if we cannot get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects to it. The first is the quality and the range of the goods that are available for international travellers. The second is the physical availability of duty-free shopping to transit passengers through airports in Australia. More and more we are seeing that situation develop with through flights where people may be going on to New Zealand or some other destination. They arrive in Australia, they have our money in their pockets, but they cannot spend our money because our stupid regulations say that they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at some of the great duty-free shopping centres around the world&mdash;and one that I pick on all the time is Dubai where a huge duty-free industry has been created at the airport shop&mdash;you can really see the potential to Australian manufacturers and to Australian retailers if we can get that situation in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government will look very closely at particularly those four or five recommendations that we have made about duty-free operations and the availability of duty-free products. I think this report is a great foundation for a very sensible review by this government and future governments of the whole area of tourism taxation. I commend the report not only to the House but also to the whole industry to sit down and have a very good read of over these coming weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, with others, would like to congratulate the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, the member for Calare (Mr Simmons). He has run a happy ship, it has been free of partisan rancour; and for that he deserves our gratitude. It was a very hardworking committee, and the fact-finding mission up to the Great Barrier Reef exemplified the worst of all possible worlds. I think the chairman is to be congratulated for being the first person ever to organise a trip to the Great Barrier Reef which was all work and no play whatsoever. When I got home, notwithstanding the regime of morning public hearings, afternoon site inspections and evening civic receptions with councillors who told us that places like Airlie Beach all deserved their own particular international airport, my wife thought I had been on some sort of glorified holiday. Such is the nature of public service, I guess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report is a very valuable compendium of some of the problems that government inflicts on an important Australian industry. For example, let us look at the fringe benefits tax. The Hilton Hotel told us that in 1994 it had spent $8,500 of staff time to do the paperwork for tax which netted the government just $8,000 in revenue. Let us take the sales tax situation. We were told very credibly that customised four-wheel drive vehicles seating eight people under the existing regime would cost $121,000. A customised four-wheel drive seating 13 people&mdash;a larger vehicle&mdash;would cost just $100,000 because of the idiocy of the existing sales tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at excise tax. Because of the existing rules, a cruise ship going from Sydney to Cairns has to pay excise tax on its fuels. If the cruise ship had gone from Sydney to Suva and back to Sydney, it wouldn't. Obviously, we want the tourism dollar spent in Australia and not overseas. That is yet another silly example of what is happening under the existing system. The committee made a useful start in stripping away the absurdities, the superfluidities and the incongruities in the existing system. The committee accepts that there is no point in adding to what is already a rickety and ramshackle indirect taxation regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the committee for two things in particular: first, for its strong recommendation against any imposition of a bed tax. A bed tax would make accommodation in Australia more expensive. In other words, Australians would be encouraged to go overseas and discouraged from holidaying in our own country. It is a discriminatory tax and one which, if it ever happened, would discriminate against what is possibly the largest industry in my own electorate. I suggest that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) take careful note of this recommendation and strenuously avoid using the tourism industry as a soft target in his attempt to raise revenue in the forthcoming budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that I congratulate the committee on is its sceptical attitudes to payroll tax. Payroll tax is a tax on jobs&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. It makes the employment of ordinary, decent Australians more expensive and therefore less likely. At a time when we are going through restructuring, when many industries are becoming more capital intensive and are employing fewer people, it is so important that those industries, such as tourism, which do employ people are given every advantage. Reconsidering this whole issue of payroll tax is one way of doing it. Dropping payroll tax, the committee concludes, would add possibly 150,000 jobs. The Prime Minister himself in 1982 believed that the abolition of payroll tax would save 200,000 jobs. I commend that move&mdash;one, incidentally, recommended by the Fightback package&mdash;to the government. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfortunate aspect of this report is that the committee did not draw the obvious conclusions from the evidence. The committee was not prepared to say that the whole indirect tax system needs to be looked at again. If we are ever to get a decent tax system in this country, it has to be approached in a bipartisan way. The Labor Party tried in 1983 and&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House calls on the Government to develop a Timber Industry Plan to (a) ensure full protection of high conservation value native forests, (b) facilitate the move to high value adding production in the industry, (c) eliminate inappropriate subsidies which artificially depress the price of timber extracted from native forests and (d) guarantee that there will be no net loss of employment as a result of the changes.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because of the very deep concern I have for the protection of Australia's old growth native forests and for the environmental concerns associated with the protection of those forests. I place on record for the interest of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who is not present today, that this concern goes back a lot longer than my association with Fitzroy coffee shops, which I think was the term he used to explain my strongly held views on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I first became involved in these issues almost 20 years ago, when I was a teenager. Unlike, I suspect, most members of this House, I have actually worked in some of the forests involved in this debate, although that was a long time ago. I certainly do not claim to be an expert. I was a labourer for about six months, so I certainly do not claim any special expertise, but I come from one of the involved areas. I know a bit about the issue and I am not just leaping on a bandwagon, as the honourable member for Corangamite implied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has its origins in the national forest policy statement and, in particular, the clause that has been termed the moratorium clause. In effect, that clause states that the various state governments&mdash;with the exception of Tasmania&mdash;and the federal government agree that areas of forest likely to be of high conservation value will not be logged pending final assessment of their values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a fairly straightforward, unequivocal and logical proposition. Clearly, you cannot log a forest first and then decide to protect it for future generations. You cannot clear-fell an area and then decide that it has high conservation value. In effect, the original decision by the government breached the national forest policy statement in that regard, and subsequent decisions have also breached it. We are still in a position whereby substantial areas identified by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) as being likely to be of high conservation value have actually been or are going to be logged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this important? What is the issue? The issue is that, for a variety of reasons, regrowth forest is not the same as old-growth forest. Animal habitat is destroyed and many species are unable to return. Particular types of native flora&mdash;for example, tree ferns&mdash;find it difficult or impossible to regrow in regrowth forests because of the uniform nature of the age structure. There is also a substantial problem with water loss. A lot of research indicates that regrowth forests use substantially greater amounts of water than old-growth forests and therefore reduce the water catchment values of the areas that have been logged. In effect, that means that we as a community are making an uneconomic decision to actually downplay the importance of the water that is produced by those areas relative to the timber that can be produced from logging, even though when we do the sums and work out the relative costs we can see that it is not a good bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole list of other issues, such as nutrient loss, compaction and siltation, all add up to the fact that there is a serious problem with logging. If old-growth forests have value in protecting endangered species, which is certainly the case in most forests in dispute in East Gippsland and other parts of Victoria, there is a problem. The Resource Assessment Commission report of 1992 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not feasible to log oldgrowth forests and yet retain their full complement of oldgrowth attributes and values. Logging oldgrowth forests potentially violates the precautionary principle of sustainable development in that an irreplaceable resource is being destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA>The coupes the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories recommended not be logged, pending final assessment, have been subject to a very extraordinary barrage of often quite dishonest propaganda. We are told, for example, that there is a particular coupe where there are a few pine trees as if, in some way, this poisons the rest of the coupe or infects the rest of the coupe. The issue is: what is in the total coupe? It is a bit like saying that because there are a couple of fakes in an art museum you should blow it up. The question is: what is in the total coupe? What values are there? What endangered species values are involved? What are the reasons why it may be of high conservation value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rescheduling is certainly available for the coupes that are subject to being assessed. In the past, we have seen bodies like the Victorian Forest Commission, now the DCNR, saying in 1984 that it wanted to log the Rodger River area, which is an area that I have worked in and which is a magnificent forest area. It was stopped by the environment movement and it said, `No, we can't reschedule. There are no other coupes available anywhere.' What did it do eventually? Yes, it rescheduled; it did have other coupes available. Exactly the same thing is going on at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the environmental issues. The real substantial issues in this debate are economic. What we have is a declining, minority section of the timber industry that is heavily subsidised and is being squeezed by other sections of the industry, particularly the softwood plantation sector. We also have the impending growth of overseas resources into our export markets. That has a very limited future and is damaging the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Andrew Dragun of the La Trobe University recently did a study of the subsidy to the Victorian native forest timber industry. He estimates that the direct deficit between what royalties the state government is paid from the industry and what the state government spends on the industry is about $50 million and he estimates a further indirect deficit of about $385 million. We can all argue about the magnitude of the deficit, but even the state government itself admits that there is a deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we are doing, in effect, is tilting the level playing field in the wrong direction. What we have is a substantially less environmentally damaging industry in the softwood plantation based industry, which is now the majority part of the timber industry in this country, and we are tilting the playing field against it. Our own federal government National Plantation Advisory Committee says that the subsidy to the native forest timber industry from state governments `is one of the most serious impediments to the development of plantations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The softwood plantation sector is growing very rapidly because it has obvious economic advantages, such as accessibility, topography, utilisation of technology, shorter rotations and the capacity to engage in selective breeding processes and the like. The resource from that sector will somewhere between double and triple in availability by the end of this decade. There are big investments going into the milling capacity and processing of softwood plantation resource in areas like Bombala with CSR, Associated Kiln Driers in the Latrobe Valley, SEAS Sapfor in Tasmania and Westpine in Western Australia. There is still not enough investment, because the volume of material that is coming on-stream from plantations is increasing so dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Softwood is substitutable for the vast majority of products that are made from timber. There are a small number of products that have to be made from hardwood, but we have substantial hardwood plantations coming on-stream that were planted mostly in the 1980s&mdash;predominantly for pulp, but not only for pulp&mdash;so that by the end of this decade there will be no reason we will need to take timber out of native forests at all. There may be some scope for specific specialty timbers that are being extracted. I certainly do not oppose that. Adrian de Bruin from SEAS Sapfor, who is a partisan player in the debate but knows what he is talking about and has to sustain public credibility, stated recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will get to the stage where we virtually do not have to log native forests at all in the next two to five years.</PARA>
<PARA>So the lights are going out in this industry. What is happening is that the people who are workers in the industry are being led into political problems that they should not be having. They should be focusing on the question of restructuring the industry and ensuring that they are the ones who get the new jobs that are emerging in other sections of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plantations are already dominant. The only broad category of wood product that we produce in this country&mdash;and a majority of it comes from native forests&mdash;is woodchips. Whether it is particle board, veneers or paper&mdash;you name it&mdash;the majority comes from plantations already. We will have enough resource to be self-sufficient in timber, to be able to not log native forests and to solve the environmental problems by the end of this decade; in other words, in five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export woodchip market is dwindling rapidly already. Why are the companies not complaining about the phase-out of export woodchipping that the government committed itself to in 1992 and again recently? Because the market is doing it for them. In 1986-87 we supplied about two-thirds of the export woodchips that went into Japan. What do we now supply? About one-third. The reason is that substantial eucalypt plantations in countries like Chile, Brazil and South Africa are coming on-stream. So the bottom is falling out of our export woodchip market; and when that falls the uneconomic sawmilling industries, which are effectively woodchipping to stay alive against their softwood competition, are going to be in big trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a parliament and as a government need to start addressing these issues. We need to make sure that we have the regional adjustment strategies in place and that those people who are almost certainly going to lose their jobs in this industry anyway, irrespective of the environmental considerations, are not left high and dry by market forces and by the NAFIs of the world which just want to get in there, rip out what they can and then nick off. We need to make sure that they get a decent and fair go and that the environment and our old-growth native forests are protected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has raised these amazing issues of old-growth forests versus new-growth forests, subsidising forest industries and softwood versus hardwood. I will demolish most of those arguments quite convincingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing the timber industry needs at the moment is yet another plan. We have had so many plans, strategies, studies and inquiries that the Commonwealth government has become confused and unable to implement a commonsense forest policy. The member for Melbourne did not spell out in his speech what he thinks is wrong with the national forest policy statement, which the government is refusing to implement. He suggested that we need a new plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion the member for Melbourne puts forward has four parts: protecting high conservation value forests, encouraging value adding, eliminating subsidies for the industry and guaranteeing no loss of employment in the industry. This motion is premised on a combination of factual inaccuracies and bogus magic puddings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to jobs, the agenda of the member for Melbourne and his radical green cheer squad is to close the timber industry down in old-growth native forests. To claim that this can be done at the same time as maintaining 75,000 timber workers in jobs is a fantasy of monstrous proportions. In the last three weeks the federal cabinet's decision to set aside some coupes from woodchip exports and the cynical decision to defer the judgment of the New South Wales coupes until after the election have cost jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, on 7 March Len Ferguson of Coastline Timbers at Moruya closed the sawmill indefinitely because of the withdrawal of the previously approved logging compartments by the federal government. He had 15 employees. Last week, contractor Dennis White put off 10 employees and left his $1.5 million worth of machinery idle because of the cabinet's decision not to allow export of woodchips from several coupes in south-east New South Wales. Closing off forest areas has a real and immediate impact on jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the honourable member for Melbourne's suggestion about subsidies, the argument that the industry is subsidised is one of the weakest arguments the radical greens can produce. Their claim is that, because some forest agencies have run at a lost in the past, this represents a taxpayer subsidy. This argument ignores the fact that forest agencies perform many services which are clearly for the public good, such as fire protection and other measures. Last year the Victorian forest service made $1.5 million profit on its native forest operations. Furthermore, the cost of running state forests would rise an estimated $16 million in Victoria if the timber industry did not operate in public forests. The cost would rise by $26 million to manage public forest to the standard of national parks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value adding possibilities which the honourable member's motion suggests will never be provided by the ad hoc government processes and by shutting off yet more and more forest each year. The development of a pulp mill in Australia would require an up-front investment of about $1 billion. No investors would put up this sort of capital if they cannot be assured that there is a resource security of timber to run the pulp mill. A clear example of that is Wesley Vale in Tasmania where no resource security was forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the high conservation value areas, the key part of the motion before the House. We do not need a new timber industry plan to protect high conservation old-growth areas. We already have a plan, the national forest policy statement, which the government and the states have agreed to over the last three or four years. It was signed in 1992 by the Commonwealth and all mainland states to overcome the overlap between the state powers over land use and the federal powers over woodchip exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy statement sets out the need for comprehensive regional assessments to take place on a set of uniform and agreed guidelines. We could not get better than that. That is the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states. The states, not the Commonwealth, know all about forestry practices. These comprehensive regional assessments are to result in regional forest agreements between the Commonwealth and the states as to which forest areas can be used for production and which should be conserved. With these agreements in place, we would not then get illogical results such as the present situation where, in several places, logging is allowed but the exporting of residue or waste timber is not. The honourable member for Melbourne does not really resolve that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement will work in setting aside high conservation value forest areas at the same time as providing certainty for the industry. The honourable member does not really say what is wrong with the national forest policy statement. The only thing wrong with the national forest policy statement is that the Commonwealth government has ignored it altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional forestry agreements were supposed to be in place by 1995. That is not the case at the moment because the Commonwealth has not proceeded with these agreements that were established in 1992. The federal government has not even provided the final guidelines for reaching regional forest agreements. The draft guidelines were out in April 1994, but the final guidelines are yet to appear. However, the states have been conducting their own comprehensive assessments of forest areas for some time. These assessments have been based on scientific rigour and balanced assessment&mdash;unlike what the Commonwealth, which comes very late to this task, has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every state can provide examples of this. In Victoria, the Cain Labor government in 1986 implemented the timber industry strategy with bipartisan support. That strategy involved comprehensive regional assessments of forest areas and a legislated code of practice which required that logging take place on a sustainable basis and which guaranteed the protection of wildlife corridors, sites of significance, seed trees, habitat trees, steep slopes and water catchments. In New South Wales similar assessments were done. Likewise, in Western Australia a cooperative set-up was organised. I have actually been on the site and had a look at the arrangement between the environmentalists and the state departments there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these assessments carried out by the states, we already have about 70 per cent of the native forests set aside from timber production. The House should be aware of that: 70 per cent of the forests is set aside as national parks and other areas. The remaining 30 per cent is logged on a rotation of around 80 years so that, in any one year, less than two per cent of the area available for logging is actually harvested. That is the key thing that the member for Melbourne should understand, but does not seem to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has yet to inform the states what is so wrong with their assessment procedures that the Commonwealth should override these assessments and shut off 509 logging coupes from the export of woodchips. That highlights the illogical nature of the current situation: areas which are available to be logged cannot have residue or waste timber exported as woodchips. Of course, the Commonwealth uses this power to interfere with the states' handling of forestry matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Commonwealth has yet to provide final guidelines for making regional forest agreements, even though the draft guidelines were available in April last year. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) believes that the lack of regional forest agreements is the fault of the states. He said this in question time on 2 February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this point, not one regional forest agreement has been entered into because the Commonwealth has to be invited to participate. Let me make it clear that the reason they have not been agreed to is that the Commonwealth has not yet been invited to participate.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his view. However, I have here a letter from the Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet to Dr Michael Keating&mdash;not to be confused with the Prime Minister&mdash;of the Commonwealth Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That letter dated 25 January clearly invites the Commonwealth to enter into a regional forest agreement and mentions previous invitations already made. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was suggested that we attempt to proceed with a regional forest agreement for the Central Highlands region in the expectation that this practical approach would identify the issues which needed to be clarified before such an agreement could be settled.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to suggest that officials from Victoria and the Commonwealth meet in the near future to build on the experience of the past year and quickly settle the details of the regional forest agreement process.</PARA>
<PARA>So clearly the states have been asking the Commonwealth for input, but they have not received any contribution or cooperation from the Commonwealth. That was the letter written on 25 January of this year, yet nothing has been done. Not only has the Commonwealth frustrated the states in terms of making agreements, but it has also disregarded the agreements made in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the other aspect of the national forest statement that the Commonwealth has ignored in agreements it entered into in the past involves the fact that, of the 509 coupes which the Prime Minister set aside, over 50 were in the southern forest area of Western Australia, which is covered by the joint Australian Heritage Commission and Department of Conservation and Land Management agreement. I have been to that area. We thought that was a classic, well-organised agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, yet the Commonwealth has seen fit not to proceed with that agreement but it has seen fit to override these sensible arrangements between the state and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth in the final analysis knows very little about forestry practice and is using its export powers to try to control forest production and forest practices in the states to suit its own green agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to second this motion, and I would like to endorse everything that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has said. He has worked extremely hard on this issue, and I know that he is very committed to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, this has been something of a hot issue in the last few months. Sometimes, when listening to some of the extreme views, I suspect that there has been a little bit more heat than light on the subject. It is an extremely complicated issue, and I think many people on both sides of the argument have taken perhaps too simplistic a view of it. As the House is probably aware, the caucus has set up a working group which is endeavouring to look at these issues and, as a member of that group, I personally am finding it very enlightening to hear all sides of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we ought to take a historical perspective of the issue because what we are doing now to some extent still harks back to the old colonial time of thinking that we had to conquer the land, that the land was something that was there to be overcome, to be subdued for our political needs. The recent drought shows us that there are plenty of areas in Australia being used for rural pursuits that should never have been used at all; they are simply not suitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conquest of the land to a great extent included chopping down as many trees as we could get hold of. This really came home forcibly to me a few years ago when I visited the Tweed area in the north of New South Wales. There I visited a local museum which had some magnificent photos of the huge stands of giant cedars that were very prolific in that area. One of the older members of the historical society said, `Of course, there are no cedars left now because my grandparents and their parents chopped them all down.' Although a strong rural man and, I suspect, politically conservative, he was rather embarrassed by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things have changed, and not just because of coffee shop trendies, as the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) I understand accused my colleague of being. There has been a considerable change in attitudes with regard to both our local heritage and our environment, and the two of course go together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People particularly on this side of the House will remember what were known as the green bans in the 1960s when union people at that stage were working very hard to save heritage buildings and pieces of land that were of great significance. I was living in London at the time, and I remember that somebody sent me a newspaper cutting of the plans for the Rocks area in Sydney. It was all to be demolished and wonderful new, sparkling buildings were to be put up. Fortunately some of our trendy people came in and said, `No, I think we'll keep our heritage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in a way it has worked a lot better for the built environment than it has for the natural environment. It is a lot easier to identify individual buildings, put them in their historical perspective and classify the type of architecture that needs to be preserved as an example of its type than it sometimes is to preserve the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, preserving the natural environment is not just about preserving something so that we have something pretty to look at or nice national parks to wander through. It is a case of global significance: whenever a rainforest is cut down in South America or Asia, it affects the whole world's climate. So it is not just a local argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protecting the natural environment is not just about protecting trees. Australia's forests cover about five per cent of our continent but account for an enormous range of biodiversity. This includes over half a million different species, most of which are found nowhere else on earth. So if we are looking at just preserving trees, I think that is limited. We have to look at that biodiversity and the Aboriginal culture that is also involved in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So preservation of the environment certainly does have widespread community support. My electorate does not have any logging, fortunately, but is a very environmentally sensitive area; it is right in the middle of several national parks and the people that go to live there do so because of the environment. So they are very strongly supportive of preserving the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the woodchip issue came up before Christmas, within a very short time I received approximately 500 letters, faxes, phone calls, and representations from people who came into the office. My colleagues say that interest rates are the main issue. I can tell you that I have had about five or six letters about interest rates and I have had over 500 on woodchips and forests. So, certainly from my electorate's point of view, it is an extremely important issue. I would like to read you an extract from a letter from one of my constituents which he had published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a 41-year-old 1960s leftover. I have voted Labor all my life. I have not been politically active since the Vietnam moratorium marches. This is about to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tolerate higher taxes to support a high deficit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not tolerate the sale of Australian heritage forests to off-shore interests for woodchip. These are our future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have not been misled by me at all. It is very interesting that some comments have been made about the result of the Canberra by-election. This morning our caucus committee had Robert Bain from the National Forest Products Association maintaining that the Liberal win in Canberra showed support for logging industries. He should look at some of the people in my electorate who are saying, `If you don't fix it up, we are going to vote Liberal or give our preferences to the Liberals next time'&mdash;not because the Liberals have better policies but because they want to teach us a lesson. In my view, the swing in the environment vote there probably had that much of a sense about it&mdash;and of course the Green candidate got 13 per cent, so you cannot say the vote was entirely in favour of the loggers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is a very important one. I was really surprised to hear the last speaker object to the establishment of a forest industry plan. I should have thought everybody was in favour of both conserving forests and jobs. Everyone seems to agree with the national forest policy statement. The honourable member accused my colleague the member for Melbourne of saying there is something wrong with it. He has not said that at all; it is a question of implementing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the honourable member's comments about value adding, a representative of Forestry Tasmania also came and spoke to us this morning and showed us, graphically, how value adding was happening, how much of the residue was now used in value adding and was increasing. He also told us about very concrete plans to establish a new pulp mill which is already in the feasibility stage in Tasmania. So please do not tell me that that is something that is not going to happen because nobody wants to invest in it. It is something that is extremely important, and they will be working very closely with all levels of government on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, we are looking at two issues here. One is the preservation of forests; the other is the preservation of jobs. When there is change in industry, when there is change in a lot of areas, particularly with industry restructuring, jobs are often the casualties. That is why this government is very keen to see retraining plans, as we have seen for the textile, footwear and clothing industries, the motor industry, and other areas. We are there to support those people who may lose their jobs. Obviously, the people who cut down the cedars on the Tweed all those years ago would have been out of a job if that was all they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people need security, just as the forests need security. This motion points the way, as this government is doing with our forest working group&mdash;people with a wide range of attitudes speaking to other people with a wide range of attitudes. Hopefully, we will come up with a plan that will keep everybody happy. That is my firm view; I am an optimist.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I was interested that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) brought this motion before the House, calling on the government to develop a timber industry plan. I thought we already had one; it is called the national forest policy statement. What is wrong with that? It has been accepted by the federal government, the federal opposition and all of the states. But here is the member for Melbourne, coming in and virtually trying to push it into the backwoods because he wants something else to go over the top of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His motion is in four parts. On the first part, it would be very difficult to ensure full protection of high conservation value native forests until there is a proper assessment introduced at the federal level. The term `high conservation value' must also be qualified if we are not going to close all of our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, complex assessments have been done, or are already under way, in New South Wales but it is obvious that the federal government is ignoring them. Any move to high value adding would have to include resource security for the timber industry, and this is one of the major points on which the debate must be based. Businesses are not going to spend large amounts of money on equipment if they do not know whether the resources will be available next year. Any move to close down large areas of regrowth or plantation forests because of alleged high conservation values would damage this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is no subsidy to the timber industry in New South Wales. In fact, state forests returned a profit to the community of almost $28 million last year and expect to do much better than that this year. Royalties from timber also fund important road works which are used by all sorts of other industries, including tourism. The allegation of heavy industry subsidy for state forests in New South Wales is a myth. There is no proof of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point that the member's motion covers is that where large areas of regrowth and plantation forests are closed down because of alleged high conservation values there can be no guarantee that jobs will not be lost. Resource security is absolutely vital to the future of the industry. Resource security is absolutely vital to the jobs of workers as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that national forest policy statement it was agreed that an adequate reserve system would be in place in regional New South Wales and other parts of Australia by the beginning of 1996. It was agreed under the NFPS that regional areas would undergo detailed environmental impact studies, and that after these were completed areas would be set aside to ensure a comprehensive reserve system. That is actually already happening. The process is under way and, as part of that process, huge areas of potential high conservation value forests have been placed under moratorium from logging until the process of assessment is completed and it is determined under proper scientific assessment&mdash;I emphasise that&mdash;whether the areas should be reserved. One example is an area of 14,500 hectares which is currently under moratorium in the Chaelundi state forest, near Dorrigo in my electorate of Cowper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EISs are undertaken by independent consultants and the state forests. After the study is completed the draft is put out for community consultation, public display and comment. The department of planning has a full opportunity for comment and the minister for planning has the final say. In New South Wales alone, more than $5 million was spent in the last financial year on environmental impact statements under this national policy. I wonder what is wrong with the policy that the member for Melbourne wants to get something else going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no sensible decision making until there is a full understanding of what are old growth forests and forests with high conservation values. We saw this in the debate that was going on when the loggers and the timber industries were out here. No one can yet agree on what is an old-growth forest. If you talk to the people who are very involved in the conservation area&mdash;the absolutely fanatic greenies&mdash;they say that if a forest has not been logged for 25 years it is old-growth forest. That is nonsense; quite absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous that decisions are being based on political gain rather than scientific assessment. If the member for Melbourne were still here, I would ask him: what is old-growth forest? What is high conservation value? He cannot give me a proper definition because it has not been agreed on yet. It is wrong to lock up forests because of so-called high conservation value before any proper assessment has been completed and any proper definition determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently concluded New South Wales state election campaign was very interesting. The last speaker for the government, the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), made some reference also to the vote in Canberra. She tended to believe that the result was not influenced by forest issues. I can tell her and this House that on the north coast of New South Wales there was a very strong vote for the forest industry. The National Party members on the north coast of New South Wales did extremely well. The swing towards them was up to six and seven per cent. There is no doubt about where we stand on looking after the jobs of the workers in the forest industry. </PARA>

The Briggsvale mill is a family mill and has been there for decades. Is it being rebuilt? No, because there can be no resource security. Nobody in his right mind is going to invest millions of dollars to build a new timber mill to replace one where 42 jobs were lost because of a fire.

We do not know the end result of the New South Wales election yet but if Mr Carr gets in it will be goodbye Kempsey Timbers and those jobs will be gone too. Mr Carr promised new national parks and wilderness areas in particular, and there was no consultation whatsoever with the industry. He just got a bright idea, announced it and there you go.

<PARA>What sort of signal is that sending to the forest workers of Australia? It is a screaming message to the industry, saying, `We don't want you. Don't invest. Don't consider looking for employment in the timber industry if this goes ahead.'</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to provide an information base on Australia's plantation resource and encourage a greater understanding of the critical issues surrounding the shift to plantation processing.</PARA>
<PARA>Does he really believe that we need to spend $166,000 of taxpayers' money to get an answer that says plantations are good? We all know that. The people of Australia know that. We know that reafforestation is important. We know that plantations are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the project is being coordinated by Environment Victoria, formerly the Conservation Council of Victoria. In New South Wales, the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales strikes again. I wonder whether they will have Natalie conducting this research, too, because so far, as far I can find out, all that their research has consisted of is to ask a whole series of questions from state forestry departments. So they will get the answers from the state forestry departments, put them on a separate bit of paper, put it back in to Senator Faulkner and collect their $166,000. If they rely on the information they get from the departments, at least this time it will be accurate, whereas last time they were recommending the high conservation values of forests which had been logged up to nine times and which even had airstrips on them. We must make sure that the national forest policy statement is adhered to, that there is proper research, that we give time for the EISs to go ahead, and that there is sustainable yield from our forests and sustainable jobs for our workers. </PARA>

<PARA>I believe it is vital for the government to start supporting the timber industry so that Tasmania can start developing its investment opportunities. We have stagnated over the last few years because there have been so many obstacles put in the path of investment. Just when the last state Labor government had put into place a forest strategy by which forests could be managed and cared for, the Greens managed to put a spanner in the works once again. Tasmania cannot afford this happening all the time. Sixteen per cent of Tasmanian workers are employed in forestry and timber related industries, in a state in which 11.6 per cent of the work force is unemployed. This rate compares with the national average of 8.9 per cent. In figure terms, this industry provides at least 22,000 jobs for Tasmanians. If the timber and export woodchip industries are eliminated, how many more workers will join the dole queue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few, if any, in our society want native forests logged for export woodchips, and certainly not beyond the year 2000. I agree with that, too. But communities do not want to achieve this at the expense of jobs and income. The Greens talk about huge amounts of woodchips being recovered from forests in comparison with the small amount of sawlogs recovered. But if you talk to the people who work in the bush they will say that all forests contain more pulp logs than sawlogs. In the wet sclerophyll forests the sawlog-pulpwood ratio is 1:3 or 1:4 while in the dry forests it is much lower, probably 1:15. For this reason, the clear-felling of wet sclerophyll produces more sawlogs than does selective logging in the dry forests. Forests will always produce more pulp logs than sawlogs. This is nature's way. It produces a greater quantity of lower quality material in general. Then there has been the argument that the old Forestry Commission did not work on a commercially viable basis but this certainly is not the case today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania went through an enormous self-analysis process in response to community concerns in the late 1980s. Then there was a long consultation period with industry, unions, the Forestry Commission, private foresters, environmentalists and other stakeholders through the forests and forest industry strategy process. These discussions resulted in a very carefully developed strategy which was agreed to by all parties and resulted in large additional areas of forest being set aside for conservation purposes. More recently there has been the restructuring of the Forestry Commission into Forestry Tasmania, which has now been put onto a complete businesslike footing. Dividends have been paid to the state government in the last three financial years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royalties charged to industry give a much more appropriate reflection of the value of grades of particular timbers. For example, blackwood sells for $87.07 a cubic metre, eucalypt sawlogs average $26 and low quality pulp logs average about $13. In other words, blackwood logs have seven times the value of pulp logs. The pricing mechanism is a result of a mixture of market forces and is secured through a system of competitive tendering and administrative arrangements. Presently, 60 per cent of second grade sawlogs are sold by tender. Over time, it is expected that this percentage will rise. </PARA>

This applies to Forestry Tasmania, the bigger players in the industry and the private forest growers. For instance, Forestry Tasmania harvested 5,646 hectares of native forest in 1993-94 and replanted 6,108 hectares to replace it. Although we are moving very fast in our development and shifting the industry away from old growth or native forest, it is impractical to do so in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want a quality sawlog industry there must be some logging of native forests. The closing down of the export woodchip industry will not solve anything and a shortage of sawlogs will be the result. The industry can be moved progressively towards plantations and residues, but to attempt that overnight would simply lead to the demise of the woodchip industry and would bring the sawlog industry to a complete halt. I have given the picture that Tasmania is further ahead. It does have a special position in that we have done a lot of work and some states have yet to start. We are the only place in the world to have implemented what scientists call a gap analysis. </PARA>

Gap analysis will ensure that all forest types are adequately represented in reserves, in accordance with the IUCN, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Some 200,000 hectares of forest was recommended for protection. Another 380,000 hectares was set aside to have its conservation value assessed. This is precisely what is required in the moratorium clause of the national forest policy statement. The current federal process of looking at 51 coupes is piecemeal and redundant compared with the large scale scientific approach used in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>

The process leading to tomorrow's cabinet decision has been both frustrating and enlightening. Never should we have to go through it again. If, as a result of tomorrow's decision, Tasmania loses 51 coupes, the outcome will be the loss of 368 jobs in the short term, the loss of $44.6 million in gross state product, and a further loss of about $5 million in direct revenue to Forestry Tasmania. This impact will fall most heavily on the veneer and sawlog industry. About 56 per cent of the veneer resource and 52 per cent of the high quality sawlogs will be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>

Forestry Tasmania, the private companies and growers have been working together to shift resources from one place to another so no-one would be disadvantaged by the federal government's assessment process. But there is very little room left to move. It is time to support the timber industry. That can be done only through the regional assessment agreements. Tasmania can lead the way and assist the other states. We have a long history in the way we have done things and we have worked hard to achieve a good result. The other alternative is to close up the shop and forget the word `forest' ever existed. That will throw 22,000 people on the dole and probably to the brink of despair.

The state government, Forestry Tasmania and other industries have had talks with Taiwanese interests on a pulp mill for northern Tasmania. The pulp wood is there, the resource is there, but we need the will to set those industries in motion, to take up some of the opportunities that exist within the state for the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this debate today as a member from Tasmania. What I find interesting is the timing and the nature of the two debates on the timber industry we are having today. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) gave a very good speech to the parliament, and I would think he has just about joined the Liberal Party now because he is very supportive of our position. It is very interesting that we are debating this issue a day before the federal cabinet sits down to pore over those coupes. We will come back to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyons said that the objectives can be achieved through regional forest agreements. The regional forest agreements as proposed by this federal government come from the national forest industry strategy. In the debate which preceded this one, which was also on forest industries and the environment, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) asked this House to call on the government to develop a timber industry plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the government in regard to this whole issue? Is it going to put in place the national forest industry strategy which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and all mainland state premiers signed in 1992? Nothing has been done about it. Or are we going to take up the suggestion from the member for Melbourne that we now put in place a timber industry plan? There is one important fact for all of us as Australians. There are really two broad categories of forests in this debate. There are the old-growth forests which ought to be in wood production and there are other forests which ought to be in reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the stage in the nation's development and understanding of both the environment and industry where we have put two thirds of our forests into reserves and one third into production forests. I think that is a reasonable balance. But today we have an indication by backbench members of the parliament that they do not really know whether they are Arthur or Martha or which way they are going. Some members of the government are very pro environment and want a new plan and others want to stick to the forest industry strategy. This is the whole problem with the government at the moment in regard to forest industries. It is very interesting to note the headline about the Tasmanian Labor leader, Mr Field, in one of the major papers in Tasmania `Field blasts Federal Govt'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Field said complacency and arrogance had crept into its actions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the federal government's actions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and it was time it listened to people's anger and frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the Federal Government had 12 months to learn the lessons of defeat.</PARA>
<PARA>It is talking about the federal by-election here in Canberra. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It is not too late for the Federal Government to recognise it has made many mistakes," Mr Field said.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Field said the Government's mismanagement of the export woodchipping issue had shown it was complacent and arrogant.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania saying that the federal government has failed to put in place any coherent strategy in regard to the forest industry and a balanced environment policy. It is a classic case of the government not knowing which way to go. Obviously, it is out there polling. One week it thinks, `We should chase after the environmental vote'; the next week it is, `We should chase after the blue-collar vote.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn back to the business of coupes. Tomorrow the government will decide whether or not we well get our 509 coupes. A year or so ago Minister Lee thought 17 coupes should come off the list. There were about 3 1/2 thousand in total being considered in Australia. Then Minister Faulkner said, `No, I want 1,300.' Mr Beddall said, `No, we'll have 85.' All this was done very scientifically. Minister Beddall said, `We have gone through it and sorted it out very carefully.' Then the Prime Minister came out with 509 coupes&mdash;a compromise in the centre, between 1,300 coupes and the 85 or so proposed by Minister Beddall. All of this, they tell the Australian people, has been done scientifically, carefully and rationally. It is a lot of hocus-pocus. </PARA>

We have done a rigorous assessment.' When we get the papers of the 511 coupes, how many pages are there for the whole of Australia? Fourteen pages.

Where are the decision making processes of this government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The federal cabinet members are very informed about the coupes. They have been to Tasmania, looked over the 72 coupes and no doubt have been to Picton forest. They will probably have a cabinet meeting at 10 o'clock tomorrow night. They will pour over these coupes and wonder where the lines should go. They will say, `No, it cannot go up there; that is the black stump out of that coupe. We have some yellow-bellied parrots over there; it cannot be there.' Do you expect the federal government of this country to have any detailed knowledge of these coupes? Of course not; it is an impossibility. But it shows what a farce this whole debate is. It is an absolute farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyons, who proposed this debate, is spot on. He is wrong, however, in that he is on the wrong side of the parliament. Today he argued vigorously against the government's stance on this issue. I have seen forestry debates in the parliament every year or so for the past 10 years when the issue of export woodchip licences has come up. What do we find? We find the Labor Party backing off. It says that we should give more forests back to the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyons gave a good speech. He now has to decide whether he is going to stay with the government&mdash;which is going to sell out the forest industries&mdash;or join the other side of the parliament, which believes in a balance between forest industries and the environment.

<PARA>There is no doubt on this side of the House that the Labor government has a clear policy of supporting the timber industry. The timber industry is a hardwood industry and a softwood industry. Regardless of what members of the opposition may say, both of these timber industries are large employers of Australians. They generate products that the Australian community desires and is prepared to buy and use. Through these products, we see much of regional Australia being sustained in the way we would expect it to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting the timber industry, the government takes a very clear line. We have unique forests in Australia. They are where we base our hardwood industry. As yet, we do not have plantations of hardwood which can sustain a sawlogging industry. Through our policies, and through the national forest policy agreement, we on this side of the House know and maintain that we have and will continue to have a native hardwood industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also strong supporters of plantations. We have seen large investments in Australia in softwood plantations. Most investments to date have been in softwood plantations because they produce a return in a much shorter time than do hardwood plantations. That is one of the basic problems we have. Our community is not fully aware of the issues in relation to this. We are very much in danger of moving politically to a situation where it would become city versus country. City voters could become more important to the industry than the voters of country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am gravely concerned about that. It is about time politics is taken out of this issue and point scoring is put aside. I am yet to hear strong statements from the opposition in support of the industry. Members of the opposition do not come out strongly in support of the industry.

We support both a hardwood industry and a softwood industry. The industry is environmentally sound and ecologically sustainable. There is no industry on this earth that is more environmentally sound than the timber industry. It uses the natural resource of the earth to produce its product. It can be ecologically sustainable because it will regrow. The Australian people understand that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a sustained campaign in Australia by a minority group who want to see the forests locked away from the hardwood industry. Every year when we deal with export licences what do we see? We see the campaign wound up every time&mdash;this year, I think, more so than any other year. It commenced back in last November. For eight to 10 weeks in the media in Australia we had nothing else but stories on the environment. Regardless of how much effort was put in, it was almost impossible to get the message through to those taking the other side of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to many people about this in this House. I would say that, going around the back benches on both sides of this parliament, the knowledge in this parliament is about equal to the knowledge in the community. Nothing reflects the views of a community more than the elected representatives. The knowledge that people on both sides of the House had six weeks ago on the forest industries was very slim indeed. Today the debate has got to the point where not only is the parliament more aware of the issues but also the media is more aware of the issues. When reporters now get a statement they ask whether it is factual and they get the other side of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the stage in this parliament where we have to put this issue to bed once and for all. In the next 48 hours the government, through the cabinet, will be in a position to follow through on the actual policy of the Labor Party. We believe in the development, and sustaining, of a hardwood industry in the forests of Australia which is environmentally sound and done in a way that is acceptable to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political problem at the moment is that I do not think the real issues are quite as deep in the intellect of the people in the cities. In many places they still believe that the industry is knocking down all the forests. That is not true. Sixty-five per cent of the forests are locked away forever. They will never see a sawlog unless a tree falls across a road and it has to be cleared. That is about the only time 65 per cent of our forests will see a sawlog. Ten per cent of our forests are woodlands where the only timber that is taken from them is for firewood. Much of that forest is on the fringes of our towns and cities. So that leaves 25 per cent of our forests available to not just the forest hardwood industry but also the community. </PARA>

That is hardly an operation that is going to knock down all our forests, as we have been led to believe by many of the headlines we have been reading over the last three or four months in our national media. It is hardly a factual statement that should give the impression to many people that we need to get the industry out of the forests because it is doing terrible damage to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a common agreement that we should have a sustainable and environmentally sound hardwood industry. The only way we will get that is when this gets off the political stage, when all states sign the national forest policy agreement and when the criteria for and meanings of old-growth, rainforest and biodiversity are specifically agreed to by all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are never going to satisfy some people in relation to what `biodiversity' means, because it is here, there and everywhere. If we are worried about damaging some biodiversity, then human nature would have to stop and stand still because, no matter whether you are producing food or doing anything else in this world using the earth's resources, you are going to affect biodiversity. Therefore, that issue needs to be put to bed&mdash;and put to bed very quickly, because it is the latest issue coming forward in the debate on why we cannot stay in the forest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about protected species? The Resource Assessment Commission in a three- to four-year study found that the forest industry has not caused the loss of one species. The forest industries are in the forests. The danger to species is on the fringes of our cities, in our woodlands. The danger comes from the backyard moggy which, when put out the door at night, goes and kills the birds. It is the wild dogs and foxes that destroy the nests. That is where most of the problem comes from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to city people to look in their own backyards, to see what their own environmental problems are, before they ask regional country areas with hardwood industries to carry the burden of the conscience of Australia on the environment.

We must in the next 24 or 48 hours find a solution to this problem, take the politics out of it and understand some of the reality of Australia's need for this industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have got a lot of sympathy for the two Labor members who have just spoken to this motion, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). We know they have been desperately trying to get the Labor government they are part of to do the right thing by Australian people and to make proper decisions about the management of our resources. We know that they have virtually despaired in their efforts to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to make a couple of comments in the context of the motion proposed by the member for Lyons. The first one is that we are just coming out of a Canberra by-election in which the Australian people, represented very largely by the people who voted in Canberra in this election, have given a resounding kick in the pants, to use the expression of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), to this Labor government. And why not? The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), even in the aftermath of the election, is belittling the voice expressed by those people so strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just refer to a couple of comments he made. He said that the Canberra voters are `a bit out of sorts'. Just a bit out of sorts, that is all! He said that this is not really an election. The Prime Minister said, `When there is a real election on, as there was in New South Wales, then it goes down to the wire on the issues.' He said that the issues he represented that have to be faced up to are `giving us an identity of our own' and `giving us a place in Asia'. He said that is why the voters felt a bit out of sorts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Prime Minister, just like this government over the last 12 years, has ignored the real interests of Australian people and their future for the purposes of posturing overseas in Bonn and in other places. The results of that bad government over 12 years have now caught up with the Prime Minister and the government. It does not matter at all about the cabinet meeting tomorrow: the time is up for this government. The message is clear that the Australian people have said, `You've had your chance. You have taken us into the worst recession we have ever had, you have increased the national debt to the point where it is out of control, you have increased the cost to Australians servicing interest bills and you have increased interest rates. You are taking us out of the recession, out of the short period in the sunlight, back into another economic disaster. You have forced people in the timber industry and from timber towns&mdash;hardworking Australians&mdash;to come out in the streets and protest like they have never done before.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just pay tribute to the people who did spend the time, using their own money and sacrificing their own income and wages, to come up here for four of five days to tell the Australian people about their plight. I have great admiration for their efforts and for what they did. There is no question of a doubt that what they did was an important thing for Australia. They ruled the line in the sand. What they said was that they, like other families in Australia, have had enough of this government; that its time is up; that 12 years is too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another cabinet meeting tomorrow is not good enough. It is not good enough to see senior members of the Labor Party here today, 12 years after the government was elected, making a plea for a decent timber industry and a forest protection policy for Australia&mdash;you could almost hear the prayer&mdash;`This cabinet meeting surely will solve our problems&mdash;please.' I know very well that they are sincere and that they are concerned about the problems and the way the political debate has been handled. But it is not good enough to say, `Let us give them one more cabinet meeting.' The Prime Minister refused to have a cabinet meeting while the protesters from the timber industry and timber towns were out the front of this place; it was not until the end of that week that he reluctantly agreed to it. Why did he do it? It was not because of the interests of Australia. It was not because of the need to protect our forests and to have a viable timber industry in Australia. It was not for those reasons at all. It was simply because he thought, `I had better buy some more votes. I had better try to get some preferences from the Greens.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of standard of leadership that the Prime Minister has set. He was not prepared to talk to the protesters until he was forced to. He treated them with derision. When he walked up here the press caught him in his foulest mood. He was deriding those decent Australians for impeding his path and making him walk to work rather than drive here. He had to back off the next day after his media minders said to him, `Hey, Prime Minister, calm down.' But it was too late. The Prime Minister has done untold damage to the good will of Australians who are normally prepared to sit down, put politics aside and talk about the ways in which our forests can be protected and our timber industry can be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Victorian, I would like to pay tribute to the Victorian timber industry and to the Victorian government's efforts over many years to achieve a very responsible approach to our timber industry. Victoria has spent more than 20 years in intensive study and debate to achieve a proper balance between the demand for forest products, employment and economic growth and the concern about the environment. The approach that Victoria has adopted to land use planning processes and practices by using independent land use planning bodies, the Land Conservation Council, amalgamated land management practices and a legislated code of forest practice is, in fact, a model for Australia and was endorsed by the Resource Assessment Commission as an appropriate model for other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the rigours and pain of the recession, there has been no demand from the Victorian timber industry to undo that work. It has stuck to it grimly and at great sacrifice to make it work. This is despite the fact that Australia has run a substantial current account deficit which is getting worse all the time. Last month's figures, heaven forbid, will be released later this week. At the same time we have witnessed the situation where our imports of forest products for Australia's consumption are approximately $2.6 billion, while our exports are only approximately $859 million and that figure is assisted by woodchip exports of $456 million. </PARA>

What I have been saying is that for 12 years the Keating and Hawke governments have failed to address properly their responsibility to introduce policies to look after the forests and the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the honourable members for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), Braddon (Mr Miles) and Indi (Mr Lieberman). They have shown great familiarity with the timber industry. As the honourable member for McMillan has said, they show familiarity with it but they have not come up with their own forest policy. This government came up with the national forest policy statement. Those honourable members support it, and I applaud them for that, but part of the problem today, I believe, is that the opposition has not strongly developed and argued its own forest policy within the forums of this House. The sort of thing that has happened today will happen when oppositions do not fully take on their responsibilities to develop their own policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Indi referred to decisions to be made by the cabinet in the next two or three days. I hope that the cabinet will make a positive decision in relation to a number of coupes which need to be scheduled fairly quickly for logging. As far as those in New South Wales are concerned, not one of those coupes was considered three or four weeks ago for possible release; not one of those coupes not released was listed in areas proposed by the New South Wales Labor Party opposition, led by Bob Carr, for listing in national park areas. So there is no real reason to wait any longer for the release of those coupes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited one or two coupes just the other day to strengthen the point that was made by the honourable member for McMillan that there is a lack of understanding about these coupes. I visited one coupe which has not been released for logging because it has some old growth. It is 17 years since that coupe was last logged. It needs thinning badly. The old growth was left there 17 years ago precisely because of the sensitivity of those that were logging at the time. Now it is said that we should not log it because there is old growth there! This is an impossible dilemma that the industry faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other coupe has been set aside under a moratorium by the New South Wales government, which shows that they are also affected by their city interests. This coupe was last logged in 1952. It has been extremely well managed; in fact, the foresters are very proud of the way in which they have managed this coupe and show it off. It was thinned in 1993. It is now an absolute picture of sawlog quality timber, straight timber, ready to be logged, I guess, in the not too distant future, but it has been thinned. It does look pristine. I saw a lyrebird in the half hour or hour I was there. The coupe is now under moratorium. This shows the problems that the industry has. As the honourable member has said, there is no proof of wildlife being hurt, especially when the management, with sensitive biologists, is under the control of those state forests. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I take a point of order. Under the standing orders, changes to the roster must be preceded by consultation with the opposition. About an hour and a half ago, I received notification from the office of the Leader of the House to the effect that Minister Brereton would not be here on Wednesday and Thursday; and that that would necessitate a change in the roster. That change in the roster has been undertaken without any consultation and that, therefore, puts it in breach of the standing orders. I believe, Mr Acting Speaker, you should firstly make a declaration that the roster as now tabled is in breach of the standing orders. Secondly, you should require the Leader of the House to apologise. Thirdly, you should seek from the government a commitment to due process as required by the standing orders. It may well be that as soon as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> was shown, this minister decided that this was the week to be away.</PARA></TALK.START>

The other thing about the ACT election was that there was a very large swing away from the Labor Party, and obviously nothing in the three weeks since those elections changed the electors' minds. As a consequence, the government lost a seat. The Leader of the Opposition, in a sense, can count his lucky political stars because he was not even going to run a candidate.

I also refer to reports this morning that Mr Skase may seek compensation from the Commonwealth government for the inconvenience of his detention in custody during the extradition proceedings. Can the Attorney-General advise the House whether there are further options open to the Commonwealth government to pursue Mr Skase's extradition to Australia? What is the government's response to Mr Skase's threat of legal action to seek compensation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2126" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did hear radio media reports this morning of an interview that Mr Skase had apparently given to a Spanish newspaper during which he stated that he may be contemplating legal proceedings to seek compensation. I assume that would be on the basis that the extradition proceedings against him were somehow improper or malicious, or something along those lines. The proceedings against Mr Skase followed an investigation by, firstly, the Queensland Corporations Office and, secondly, the Australian Securities Commission into the collapse of the Qintex group. Those charges were then laid under the Queensland Companies Code, which was the companies law then in place, and charges were also laid under the Bankruptcy Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The District Court in Queensland heard arguments as to whether an arrest warrant should issue for those charges. The judge in question, His Honour Justice Pratt, concluded that Mr Skase was a fugitive and that the health grounds which he alleged stopped him coming back to Australia were not sufficient. An arrest warrant was issued following the order of that court. Extradition proceedings, hence, were taken after a very thorough process of investigation and legal proceedings in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proceedings in the Spanish legal system, it should be remembered, were a matter for the Spanish government, which is the way in which extradition proceedings operate as a matter of international law. Before the First Instance Court in Spain Mr Skase was held to be an extraditable person. Although the court made some comment about his health conditions, it was ordered that he could return safely to Australia. On appeal, that decision regarding the health grounds&mdash;and the health grounds only&mdash;was overturned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point to remember is that, as a matter of law, the extradition requirement between Australia and Spain was made out 100 per cent. It was on the very unusual and exceptional arguments of Mr Skase's alleged health condition that the court in question, the appeal court in Spain, held that Mr Skase should not return on the basis that it would be an unreasonable risk to his health. I do not agree with that decision of the appeal court in Spain. I do not think that decision was right. I believe the medical evidence&mdash;which was accepted by two earlier courts&mdash;which stated that Mr Skase could safely return to Australia was evidence which should have been accepted by the appeal court in Spain. Although I do not like that decision, as a matter of Spanish law obviously the Australian government has to accept that decision, notwithstanding our frustration at that decision having been reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after that decision, I did seek advice from the Spanish prosecutor as well as an independent legal firm in Spain as to whether there was any further opportunity to reopen the extradition proceedings on the basis of some evidence of Mr Skase's health improving. The advice from the Spanish government was that the ruling of the court, as a matter of Spanish law, completed the matter and that, even with evidence of an improvement in Mr Skase's health, the proceedings could not be opened. This does not mean, however, that the charges have gone away&mdash;they remain on foot. Nor does it mean that, if Mr Skase ever leaves Spain, these matters cannot be pursued again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for Mr Skase's claim for compensation, I am advised there is absolutely no basis for such a claim. These were proper proceedings involving a serious corporate collapse following a major investigation. Many people in this country, particularly in my home state, have suffered greatly as a result of that collapse. Those people are rightly frustrated and angry about the whole proceedings, but the Australian government will pursue every avenue which is open to it in this matter. If Mr Skase wishes to bring proceedings, I welcome him to do so. He might even return to Australia to lodge the claim himself.</PARA>

In the last budget there was concern generally within the Australian community that the issue of employment ought to be given fundamental priority.

Those reforms have worked their way through the system to the extent that, in terms of both employment and, increasingly, unemployment, Australia has had a record year&mdash;completing, as the Prime Minister said, a record which has created more than 500,000 jobs in two years and exceeding the government's commitment in the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I am delighted to report to the House that, at the end of February 1995, approximately 4,000 federal enterprise agreements covering 56 per cent of federal award employees have now been registered before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I can report that the quality is improving quite dramatically as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those agreements, 1,375&mdash;that is some 40 per cent&mdash;have been registered since the Industrial Relations Reform Act came into effect on 30 March 1994. The first anniversary of that act occurs this week. This represents a 70 per cent increase in agreement making compared with the corresponding period in the previous year; that is, 70 per cent up on the previous year as a result of the Industrial Relations Reform Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same period, the number of employees involved in industrial disputes has actually halved and the number of working days lost reached its lowest level for more than a decade. What a success story. Simultaneously, economic growth reached 6.1 per cent, inflation remained around two per cent, the rate of employment growth touched 4.4 per cent and wage settlements averaged 4.1 per cent before productivity offsets. What a record; what a splendid achievement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before Christmas, we saw those sitting opposite and some of the employer groups whipping themselves into an absolute frenzy about the then Transport Workers Union wages claim. We remember it. They were on every media outlet in the country. Subsequently they spoke about the Asahi case. They said it was going to be the end of industrial relations as we know it. But, of course, none of their dire forecasts has ever come to pass. Indeed, the Asahi decision was comprehensively overturned by a full bench of the commission. The employer groups took out full page advertisements all around Australia headed `No business is safe'. They took those advertisements out directly after the original Asahi decision, but they did not see fit to put any further advertisements in when the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission unanimously overturned that decision and set the law straight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I add that there are plenty of people in our society who have acknowledged the progress of the federal system and who focus instead on the positive. There is a great deal of positive, as I have outlined to the House. Foremost amongst those is John Prescott, who, only last Friday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, said that the Industrial Relations Reform Act had the potential to `contribute to the evolution of an IR system that complements Australia's efforts to become more competitive'.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2131" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of the petition which has been circulated by the Australian Family Association seeking the payment of an allowance of $130 per week to homemakers or carers at home on, as I understand it, a universal basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also gather that some opposition figures, including the National Party, have been making somewhat supportive noises for such a proposal. They have been rather less forthcoming, of course, as to how the $3 1/2 billion price tag of such a proposal might be met, which is a piece of the opposition's social security spokesman's hinting that the opposition might consider a universal age pension, likewise, without explaining how the $5 billion cost of removing all means testing of age pensions might be met. But, of course, this is the same opposition that calls on the government for greater fiscal rectitude and stresses the ease of knocking billions of dollars off the outlays side of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a few points about the government's contribution in this area. The government currently spends around $12 1/2 billion on assistance in various forms to families with children&mdash;and that comes in at various parts of the family payments structure through the child-care assistance, through the home child-care allowance and so forth. That payment structure contains elements which, on the one hand, are highly targeted to families on low incomes&mdash;and that applies especially to additional family payment&mdash;and also includes elements which are not so highly targeted on a vertical basis, the so-called horizontal equity payments of HACCA and basic family payment. But, on the whole, I think we have a highly equitable structure and one which has been substantially improved in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to this issue of the so-called two-parent family with one earner and with dependent children. The way additional family payment is structured, being highly targeted on the basis of income, has the consequence that the great bulk of assistance goes to families who depend essentially on one income. So a lot of this talk about the so-called single income family does not take full account of the effect of our existing payment system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make is that from 1 July this year the government will start paying the new parenting allowance. It will be paid at the rate of $272 a fortnight, which is $12 a fortnight more than is proposed by the Australian Family Association. This is a highly targeted payment that is focused on working families with single earners on relatively low incomes. That is quite deliberately the case and is part of the priority this government gives to vertical equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a proposition that was announced as part of the Working Nation reforms and as part of the overall restructuring of assistance paid to people on unemployment and on low incomes. It is a highly targeted payment that assists low income working families as well as adding to the measures that assist the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I make the point that the government is fully committed to families. It does, however, have to acknowledge the existence of fiscal constraints and fiscal realities. Therefore, we have tried to target our payment structure to a very considerable extent on the basis of need, and that is a viable and responsible way to go about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the community wants to attach any credence whatsoever to the sort of supportive noises that the Leader of the National Party has been making about the Australian Family Association proposal&mdash;without explaining how its $3.5 billion price tag would be met&mdash;it might also ask the Leader of the National Party, and the opposition generally, to throw in the moon and the harbour bridge as well.</PARA>

Further, if there are difficulties which cannot be resolved and a relationship does break down, services are available to assist parents, and particularly parents with children, to come to an amicable relationship which is in the best interests of the children involved and in the ongoing role that parents have in the upkeep and upbringing of their children, notwithstanding that the actual marriage or relationship may have failed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This set the theme for an unusually frank and open debate on the real obstacles to development in Cambodia. For its part, the Cambodian government sought to reassure donors.

Those importantly included legislation and practical mechanisms to strengthen the rule of law in Cambodia, to strengthen the accountability of government processes, to reform the civil service, to professionalise the military and to return excess soldiers to civilian life.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I ask you a question within your responsibility regarding access to the precincts of Parliament House. While we all understand the government's arrogance and lack of general ability to manage economic affairs, I thought perhaps that, with matters relating to traffic, things might have been better. As I returned to the House about lunch time today I noted that adjacent to double lines on either side of that bridge and extension of Melbourne Avenue to the south side of the executive block there are cars parked on both sides which made it almost impossible for a bus to pass a car alongside the vehicles so parked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the parliamentary precincts are within the Parliamentary Triangle and I would suggest to you that it is appropriate that vehicles so parked are creating a traffic hazard and are in a position where there could easily be a serious accident. Could I suggest to you that either the federal government or the ACT government ensure that there is action taken to ensure that those vehicles that are parked illegally are removed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was brought to my attention last week in the absence of the Speaker. I agree with the honourable member that the situation with cars parked on that aspect of Melbourne Avenue is intolerable. I was under the impression, as I think the honourable member alluded, that those vehicles parked alongside the double lines were parked illegally. Apparently, upon investigation, they are not. I have asked the Serjeant-at-Arm's office to investigate what actions are required to improve the situation. They may, as he has indicated, include us discussing with the territory government an appropriate solution.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time the member for McEwen rose and asked a question of the Minister for Finance relating to an Australian police contingent in Haiti. That question would clearly be out of order to the Minister for Finance, as it does not concern his portfolio. The Minister for Justice, without the call, walked to the dispatch box and attempted an answer. Does the effect of your allowing that answer mean that any question which is out of order can be made in order by any other minister walking to the dispatch box to take it up?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to admit that from here I was unclear as to which minister the honourable member for McEwen addressed his question. I agree that it may have been that he addressed it to the Minister for Finance. Quite rightly, as you have indicated, that would probably have been outside of the standing orders as it may not have been a responsibility of the Minister for Finance. My understanding is that, in normal circumstances, if that were to be raised as a point of order, the effect would have been on most occasions to give the honourable member an opportunity to redraft his question. To this extent, all he would have done was redraft it to the appropriate minister. Also, it is my understanding that from time to time a minister more responsible for a question might decide, by indicating, that he is willing to take a question. I think that in past practice that has occurred when questions have been asked to wrong ministers because of a lack of knowledge of the portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>Fraser Island: Logging</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="2142" SPEAKER="Truss Mr W.E." NAMEID="GT4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="WIDE BAY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wide Bay)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (4.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1991 the federal and state governments decided to ban logging on Fraser Island and in the Great Sandy Region&mdash;one of Queensland's most important hardwood timber resources. The industry had been intensively managed by the State Forest Service since 1913 and many of the most admired stands of timber on Fraser Island, including the very popular Central Station, are, in fact, forestry department tended plantations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 0.3 per cent of the island was logged each year and the industry readily co-existed with and complemented the burgeoning tourist industry. The forest industry provided most of the region's roads and other infrastructure, garbage removal and visitor information and interpretive services. Banning logging meant not only taking away the jobs of scores of timber workers but also that these services had to be provided in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the government announced its decision to end logging on Fraser Island, it announced a compensation package which it claimed would secure the future of the region. The Commonwealth government undertook to contribute $16.5 million towards the compensation package over three years, with the state government offering a further $21.2 million. Queensland's Labor Premier, Mr Goss, said that the growth and development package would strengthen the timber industry&mdash;a remarkable claim since the package was about stopping logging&mdash;create jobs, enhance tourism and assist regional development. The embattled local state Labor member of parliament, Bob Dollin, described the package as a `benchmark in compensation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the projected lifespan of the compensation package has expired, it is appropriate to review the effectiveness of the program and to examine what it has achieved for the displaced timber workers and the people of the Fraser coast and Cooloola region. Because of the use of Commonwealth money in the compensation package, it would be appropriate for the Auditor-General to conduct a full efficiency audit on the compensation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time the federal government was involved in a similar scheme was the $75 million package for the people of Ravenshoe and district after the government moved to ban logging in a part of the wet tropics nomination for the World Heritage list. On that occasion, the compensation program was administered by the federal government. It is now universally acknowledged that this package was a dismal failure and a monument to government incompetence. Seven million dollars was given to the wrong company, a portion of the promised money was never spent at all and there were few, if any, lasting benefits to the Ravenshoe district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, the federal government decided to allow its mates in the Queensland Labor government to administer the scheme. The Commonwealth government took no day-to-day interest in the way in which the money was spent and merely signed the cheques after receiving an acquittal report from the Queensland government. An agreement was signed between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments in November 1991, which outlined the way in which the Commonwealth's money would be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the terms of the agreement were often ignored and the Commonwealth signed cheques apparently without ever scrutinising the legitimacy of claims. The Commonwealth Labor government treated this compensation package as guilt money&mdash;30 pieces of silver to absolve people's consciences for taking the jobs from the timber workers of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Fraser government ended sandmining on Fraser Island, it provided compensation and job creation payments totalling $10.5 million. The program was roundly criticised by Labor, but at least the region has some lasting benefits from that package, including  Maryborough's new showgrounds and a new tourist highway link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time almost $20 million of federal tax revenue has been spent and not one comparable project has eventuated. There are no new industries and many of the displaced timber workers still have not been provided with long-term productive work. This compensation package has been at least as big a failure as the North Queensland wet tropics affair. The Queensland state government has taken advantage of the wink and nod lax federal supervision and has used most of the money to pay the salaries of state government public servants to do work that they would have done anyway and as a giant slush fund for the ailing electoral prospects of marginal ALP members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government unexpectedly appropriated an extra $13.8 million for the Fraser Island compensation package in the 1992-93 budget, allegedly to offset the effect of capital gains tax on Fraser Island compensation recipients. The government has never been able to explain the details of how it calculated this figure. But, on Labor's estimates, the amount provided is greater than the total amount of compensation actually provided to those who have had their industry close down. I can only assume that these calculations were another example of the whiteboard economics for which ex-minister Kelly became infamous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major elements of the program were job creation schemes. One of the important ones involved the thinning of commercial pine plantations in the region. Thinning is an essential element of plantation management and this work has always been undertaken by forestry workers as part of their normal routine. In this case the work was given to displaced Fraser Island timber workers. At the same time, the Queensland forestry department implemented a redundancy program laying off a large number of its permanent employees. The so-called pine plantation thinning jobs created by the package were a simple case of job reshuffling, with the state government using Commonwealth funds to undertake routine management work normally the responsibility of the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the total compensation package of over $51 million, less than $2 million has actually been paid to displaced workers. More than that was spent on administration, management and promotion. The compensation package is now exhausted and earlier this year I received a number of letters from desperate workers, including 27 who were engaged in the thinning projects who had been told that, now the compensation package was exhausted, their jobs were over and the government would do nothing more for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compensation package had not found lasting permanent productive work for these displaced workers&mdash;merely temporary jobs until the Commonwealth money ran out. Some of the other workers had been engaged in road maintenance, garbage collection and other similar functions on Fraser Island&mdash;work which had previously been undertaken by state government paid workers but for whom the salary bill was simply sent to the Commonwealth for the life of the restructuring package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite claims that World Heritage listing would lead to a tourism boom, there have been no allocations at all from the Queensland state budget for capital improvements on Fraser Island. Now that the package is exhausted, the Queensland government is proposing massive fee increases for visitors to take the place of the Commonwealth funds. It is interesting to look at some of the projects where funds were spent. Despite the dubious nature of many of these projects, the Commonwealth never queried their legitimacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the redevelopment of Wharf Street $147,000 was provided, even though the project employed no displaced timber workers and was completed before the World Heritage nomination was approved. One hundred thousand dollars was given towards the cost of buying a disused hotel for the Maryborough Family Heritage Institute, which has subsequently been sold. Instead, a former state government building has been purchased for the institute, but so far the institute has not occupied the building because of internal feuding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill for funding a main street program for Maryborough has been sent to the Commonwealth, even though the state funds similar programs in other cities throughout Queensland. Almost $20,000 was paid to the Redcliffe City Council, near Brisbane, even though clause 2 of the agreement specifically restricts the package to the local authority areas of Noosa, Widgee, Tiaro, Maryborough and Hervey Bay. Five hundred thousand dollars was provided to the QTTC for tourism promotion, while at the same time the government has closed the Orchid Beach airstrip and much of Fraser Island's road system, and is developing plans to restrict visitor numbers and ban the island's fishing competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Queensland government was systematically siphoning Commonwealth government contributions into its own state budget to pay its own public servants going about the work they should have been doing anyway, requests to fund worthwhile projects which would have really secured the future of the region were repeatedly denied. This once in a lifetime opportunity to secure the future of tourism to the region has been squandered with no major projects being undertaken and most of the money being spent on routine maintenance, garbage disposal and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost $50 million of taxpayers' money has disappeared into the sands with little lasting benefit to the region. This was supposed to be a model package securing the future of the region; yet the money is gone and the affected region still has, on the last available figures, 18.1 per cent unemployment&mdash;double the national average. The Auditor-General should undertake an urgent examination of the Great Sandy Region compensation program, examining both the use of the funds and the efficiency of the program. The federal government has been involved in two World Heritage listing compensation packages and both have been dismal failures. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I would like to take the opportunity to focus on some positive developments in our community, especially in the employment area&mdash;and there is lots of good news in that area. This stands in stark contrast to the negative attitude that we are continually hearing from those opposite and such as we</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>have just heard from the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor governments throughout the 1980s and 1990s have actually transformed Australia. Instead of taking the attitude `It'll be right'&mdash;that type of attitude was always prevalent in the coalition governments&mdash;the Labor governments of the 1980s and 1990s have embarked on a course of innovative but responsible policies and actions that have changed not only the economy but the nature of Australian society. Labor has changed the Australian state of mind for the better. We are now a much more progressive society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the Australian people to realise all the positives that are around at the moment. Young people have many opportunities available to them today that were not always available to them in the past, particularly in the education field. Under Labor, Australia has changed into a young, vibrant country looking forward to a bright and promising future. But under the policies of those opposite&mdash;the policies that they used to espouse anyway; they do not seem to have too many any more&mdash;all that promise could be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become pretty obvious to all Australians who are keen observers of the political scene in this country that the opposition, under its `new old' leader, has returned to the politics of pessimism. The opposition is continually talking down what is one of the strongest periods of economic recovery in this country's history. We have not heard anything in the way of policies or concrete ideas to solve the alleged problems that those opposite keep talking about. I would like to echo the call of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), made in response to the former member for Wentworth's resignation speech in this place, for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and his deputy to put their policies before the people and let them be judged instead of just grabbing headlines. I think that is a real challenge for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the unlikely event that the opposition does actually come up with some policies, we are left with no option but to examine the Leader of the Opposition's record in the past in comparison with the situation today. Let us look at a few examples of what it was like in the years of the Fraser-Howard government compared with the Labor governments of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average rate of economic growth under John Howard as Treasurer in the Fraser government from 1977-78 to 1982-83 was 2.1 per cent. The average rate of economic growth under Labor over the period from 1983 to 1994 has been 3.4 per cent. The forecast for the current year's economic growth is an amazing 5.5 per cent, which is up from the budget forecast of 4.5 per cent. If you think that was good, you will be really impressed when I remind you that the growth in the September quarter was 6.4 per cent, which was the highest since the March quarter of 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made all of these achievements despite having to endure the effect on the national economy of the crippling drought that has caused serious deterioration in farm production but which, thankfully, is showing some signs of abating. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has often used the 1982 drought to defend his appalling economic record as Treasurer in the Fraser government. We have to ask: what is the difference this time around? The primary sector has taken a real beating, with low world prices for many products as well as the drought, yet Australia's rate of GDP growth is one of the highest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other figures from John Howard's tenure as Treasurer that I find very interesting and which show how hypocritical the opposition's unfounded criticism is. The average rate of inflation under John Howard, for instance, was 9.7 per cent; the average under Labor from 1983 has been 5.4 per cent; and the average since June 1990 has been 2.1 per cent, one of the lowest in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition left the position of Treasurer in 1983, inflation had risen to&mdash;this really shows how hypocritical the opposition's claims of a runaway economy are&mdash;an astonishing 11.4 per cent. We can compare this with the current rate of underlying inflation for the 12 months to December 1994 of 2.5 per cent, which is the 10th consecutive quarter at or below 2.5 per cent, and that has been achieved in a period of high growth rates. Still on the inflation and interest rate front, the 90-day bank bill rate&mdash;which most members would know is the key indicator of short-term business interest rates&mdash;was 15.9 per cent in March 1983 compared with 8.9 per cent on 2 February 1995, nearly half. The good inflation figures that I have referred to have been achieved despite strong employment growth, economic growth, business investment and increasing private sector consumption and housing construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of interest rates, which has been bandied around over the last few days, I took the opportunity earlier today to look at some comparisons between 1982 and the present. The mortgage rate in December 1982 was actually 13.5 per cent; in March 1983, it was 12.5 per cent; and today it ranges between 10.5 per cent and 10.75 per cent. We need to look at the housing sector, which is always a most sensitive issue&mdash;and understandably so&mdash;because all Australians wish to buy their own home. We need to ensure that they have stability in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the figures for December 1982, that was, of course, in a regulated environment. In those days I was actually working in the banking industry and so I can relate this from my own experience. Whilst some people were paying 13 1/2 per cent through a bank when the funds were available&mdash;there were very strict requirements&mdash;a lot of people also had to have cocktail loans, where they were out paying much higher rates through personal loans or through the finance companies. So the effective rate was way above 13.5 per cent, and that is for the people who could get loans. There were, of course, a lot of people on lower incomes who could not get finance through banks. They had to get their finance through finance companies and so were paying exorbitant rates. There is now a greater availability of funds through the deregulated environment. That has been another initiative that the Labor government has been prepared to take on. We really need to look at interest rates in the true context of today's market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue on everyone's minds today&mdash;at least for everyone on this side of the House&mdash;is unemployment. Perhaps the fact that it is an important, if not the most important, issue for Labor shows the difference in the basic philosophies between us and the opposition. Unemployment has fallen from 11 per cent two years ago to 8.9 per cent today and is forecast to fall further to 8.5 per cent in the June quarter 1995. That is a full one percentage point lower than the budget estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the budget alone, some 226,000 new jobs have been created. Since the election, employment has grown by 560,000&mdash;as the February employment figures showed, with 91,000 jobs being created in that month alone. Remember, at the last election, the government promised to create half a million jobs in three years. We have actually done that in two years and that is an achievement in itself. So, through a whole combination of revolutionary but responsible spending programs contained in the Working Nation white paper and responsible economic management that provides the environment for business to prosper, the government has brought unemployment down and created real jobs in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to relate some figures on the long-term unemployed from the local DEET office in my own electorate. They are very encouraging figures. For instance, in September 1993, 43 per cent of all registered unemployed were long-term unemployed; in April 1994, 40.6 per cent of all registered unemployed were long-term unemployed; and now, in March 1995, the figure has dropped to 33.4 per cent. The programs have been so successful that it has been suggested to me in some discussions I have had with my local DEET office that we may have trouble finding enough long-term unemployed to use the funding for the proposals that we now have. So there is really good news about the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate a lot of the initiatives being carried out in my own area, particularly those under labour market adjustment programs, LEAP, jobskills programs and new work opportunities, which are all being coordinated by the local office of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and by the local area consultative committee chaired by a gentleman called Reg Bond. Reg is coordinating things very well there with the cooperation of our local regional DEET manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of outcomes we get in an area which is often suggested as having high unemployment. It has been slightly higher than the national average, but it is all turning around because of the positive attitudes coming from our local initiatives and from taking advantage of the Working Nation package. I thank the government for the opportunity to promote those things as well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my two terms in this parliament I have been involved in, and been affected by, two redistributions of federal boundaries for electorates in Queensland. When I won the seat of Moreton in 1990, I broke an 84-year run of conservative occupation of this electorate. My victory, although convincing, still left me as a holder of a very marginal seat and one that I would have to work hard to hold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redistribution of 1991 made massive changes to Moreton and to many other electorates in south-east Queensland. I knew that this would occur as the population in my area had been gradually declining while other regions had experienced enormous growth. The changes were not quite what had been anticipated and, in the first round of proposals, some were quite illogical. Through the review process we managed to achieve some changes which resulted in a reasonable electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact in movement of voters was substantial: 35,000 of my 1990 constituency of 65,000 were shifted to Griffith and Fadden and a new 45,000 from Forde and Fadden were added to the division. Therefore, 60 per cent of the new electorate of Moreton had come from elsewhere. This provided an enormous challenge after only being an MP for 18 months, but the result of the subsequent election in March 1993 provided proof of our capacity to meet the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I entered a second term as member for Moreton and was advised by the AEC that population growth in Queensland, particularly from interstate migration, was going to necessitate another redrawing of the boundaries before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first time round I had been a bit naive about the whole process. Automatic assumptions about the impartiality and expertise of the AEC in conducting the redistribution and a blind faith in my party's commitment to fairly protect my and my colleagues' interests were the features of that naivety. This second redistribution provided overwhelming proof that such assumptions were very wide of the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of the 1994 redistribution of Queensland federal electorates is a testimony to the abject failure of the procedures laid down in the Commonwealth Electoral Act to achieve impartiality; and an indictment on the competence and ability of the state's electoral commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act lays down a formula for determining who will be responsible for drawing up the initial redistribution proposals and who should be added to the commission to review the first draft and consider appeals. On first glance, the act's requirements appear to be objective, fair and impartial. The result, as demonstrated in a number of state redistributions over the past seven years, is quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State electoral commissioners wield an enormous power and influence on the whole process. Firstly, he and his staff gather all of the alleged accurate statistics outlining the current and future population position across the state. This is vital information on which the whole process hinges and it is a most inaccurate, shoddy and subjective set of material, which would embarrass any statistician worth their salt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the state commissioner draws up, utilising an AEC computer program, a draft set of maps which achieve the numerical requirements set out in the act for quotas of electors. These draft maps are distributed to the other commissioners for their approval before they are released as the proposed redistribution. In other words, one person, in Queensland's case Mr Bob Longland, has absolute and complete control on the information and processes and submits his own personal proposals to the other two commissioners who basically rubber-stamp his plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This might not be so bad if the person concerned had acted totally competently and demonstrated no personal bias or views in his conduct of the redistribution. Unfortunately, in the case of Mr Bob Longland, this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important for all voters and all members to understand is that the way redistributions are drawn, the way voters are shifted around, has an enormous impact on the election prospects of all 25 members elected from the state of Queensland. This one individual, through the way he draws these boundaries, can determine the fate of government in this country. Such power in the hands of one man was not the intent of the legislation when it was drafted; nor is it healthy for democracy or stable government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I am accused of `sour grapes', let me make my personal position quite clear: I do not seek any favouritism, or any easy ride in politics. I contested a marginal Liberal seat in 1990 and beat the incumbent. I am prepared to fight my political opponents in a fair contest and face the personal judgment of the electors. I copped the massive changes in the 1991 redistribution `sweet', and worked hard to convince my redrawn constituency to trust me with their vote. I am more than happy to do it again in the next 12 months. My commitment is to the people I am elected to represent each term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am angry about is the manipulation and unreasonable influence by one individual in the process of determining who my constituents are. These voters keep getting pushed around from electorate to electorate with scant regard to the unity of their community or the enormous confusion this creates at election time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 redistribution of Queensland electorates is a farce and a joke. The AEC redistribution commissioners should hang their heads in shame for their compliance with a set of boundaries which makes a total mockery of the principles of community of interest, logical natural boundaries and the objective of minimising dislocation of voters, as set out in section 66(3)(b) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many thousands of my constituents, this will be the third federal electorate they have been in in three electorates&mdash;they have not shifted, but the AEC has changed the boundary for them. Much of this dislocation was completely unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1994 redistribution, 24,500 voters have been taken out of Moreton and a new 30,000 voters have been added; 14,000 of those Moreton transferees were only put into Moreton in the 1991 redistribution. Most of the new electors who have come in are also suffering change from the 1991 redistribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 redistribution was based on completely inaccurate predictions of growth and movement of voters. It was stated in the growth predictions that on the 1991 boundaries Moreton would be at an enrolment of 83,000 by 1995. In actuality, it fell some 8,000 short of this projection. The suburbs of Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood, Corinda and Oxley that were put into Moreton in 1991 and taken out again in 1994 should never have been put into the seat in the first place. They have had no growth at all over the past few years, and have been totally inconsistent with the rest of the electorate. But the poor people of those suburbs have to keep on changing electorates and try to get used to new federal members each three years, which is a real challenge for most constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ineptitude and incompetence of Bob Longland's 1991 proposals caused the major redrawing of boundaries again in 1994. The 1994 boundaries are again based on totally inaccurate predictions of growth and movement and will result in further significant disruption of electors in 1997 when another redistribution will occur in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 1994 redistribution cut the Mount Gravatt district down the middle, dividing a community which has a 140-year history. They used the main transport corridor in the community, Logan Road, as the boundary between the electorates of Moreton and Griffith, ignoring the fact that it is the main shopping, services and transport corridor for residents on both sides of the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new electorate places the farming and open space community of Rochedale in Moreton, an urban electorate, thereby dividing Rochedale from Rochedale South, which is still in Fadden. Rochedale has absolutely no links or community of interest with the rest of Moreton, yet it does have a common history with other districts in Griffith and Fadden. And where is the community of interest between Highgate Hill on the south side of Brisbane and Stafford on the north side? They are now both in the Brisbane electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse is that Bob Longland has allowed his personal views on politics and politicians to influence the way in which he draws the boundaries. He has allowed his belief&mdash;that as many electorates as possible should be as marginal as possible&mdash;to dictate the boundaries. He uses the political voting patterns of certain suburbs to determine which electorate they should be placed in to best achieve his objective of maximum marginality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must advise that I have no written proof or hard data to back up these allegations. The evidence is hearsay, private discussions and conversations. I was involved personally in two conversations with Mr Longland in which he expressed his personal view about maximising marginality of electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Longland has demonstrated considerable ineptitude and incompetence in the collation and utilisation of relevant statistics and data needed for an accurate redistribution. He has deliberately chosen to ignore overwhelming evidence of community of interest and natural boundaries in the structure and review of his proposed boundaries. He has caused the unnecessary dislocation of tens of thousands of voters in the inept way he has handled these responsibilities. For these reasons, he deserves to lose his position. Of greater importance, however, is the necessity of the government to amend the relevant section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Over the period of the last 12 months or so, during the International Year of the Family, I have received a number of letters of complaint, which I have chosen not to produce in the parliament. However, one is so balanced and thoughtful, and explains the difficulties so well, that I would like to read it this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter was sent to me by a lady who lives in my electorate, and whom I will call `Marilyn', although I am prepared to give her full name. She also sent a copy of her letter to the press. Marilyn writes about her family, and I want to read out her letter because it sets out the difficulties that Australian families are experiencing today. They are problems that the government seems completely unaware of and incapable of doing anything about. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Cadman,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated January 1995 which extols the virtues of family life. Yes, Mr Cadman, I also believe in the importance of the family unit, however I feel that it is time for politicians like yourself to take a good look around.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two short years ago, we were a happy family of four: a husband, a son, a daughter and myself. The husband and the son are still there but I cannot always say the same for the daughter, and it's not so happy as it used to be. You see, we have a rebellious teenage daughter, rebellious in the extreme. She does not share your views on the importance of the family unit. She believes that we, as parents, have no say over her behaviour, her activities or her lifestyle and, thanks to our Social Security system, she's right!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She has made our lives unbearable. She has ridiculed our attempts to discipline her, accused us of (and I quote) "physical and emotional abuse" and made it quite clear that she doesn't need us. All this because she has been told that adolescents who are mistreated and/or are homeless can receive Social Security. Life became so impossible we said the words all parents say: "If you can't handle our rules you'd better find somewhere else to live". She replied by quoting examples of her friends who had left home and were now living happily off Welfare. We invited her to join them&mdash;we asked her to leave. She immediately applied for this allowance but was not deemed to be truly homeless since we responded to Social Security inquiries by telling the truth. She came home. Ten weeks later, she left again. Ditto dealings with Social Security. She is very annoyed with her failure to be supported by the taxpayer since quite a few of her friends are. The families of some of these kids were never interviewed, social workers processed their claims. There are many lazy, law-wise, lying teenagers out there being cared for by the Australian taxpayer. After the second failed attempt to be put on this "Young Homeless Allowance" she came home again, cursing all the way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Cadman. I'm not claiming that every rebellious teenager is paid to leave home, simply that teenagers all perceive that they can be. They are told, ad nauseam, that they have rights and entitlements, that parents can be arrested for smacking or raising their voices, etc., etc. . So much for kids' rights, what about the rights of parents? We've effectively lost all control. Social workers and Government agencies listen to kids and kids are having too much to say!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not a fool who blames "the Government" for all her woes nor am I advocating a return to the bad old days when kids were mistreated and there was no-one to listen. But, Mr Cadman, I put to you this question: How can the assessors for agencies like the Social Security Department possibly weed out the genuine cases from those who are simply jumping on the welfare bandwaggon? The answer is that they cannot always do this, especially if the parents of these so-called "homeless" have not been consulted. I have been told by a social worker friend that there have been recent changes to the provision of the Young Homeless Allowance but I feel that this is a definite case of wisdom with hindsight. It's too late for many families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kids don't care what their parents think or want. They're told that it doesn't matter if they don't care, they can leave home and someone else will provide.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure how much detail the opposition would like me to go into but I can explain the purpose behind the amendments. First of all, clause 31 of the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes that a new part VB be added to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act which would allow the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to prepare management plans for areas, species and ecosystems of the marine park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed to the bill introduces a new section 39YA to the proposed management plan provisions. It requires the authority to have regard to the need to protect World Heritage values of the marine park and to adopt the precautionary principle when preparing management plans. The government has shown that it is committed to the protection of the World Heritage values of all World Heritage areas. The amendment explicitly states what was implicit in the bill&mdash;that is, that management plans for the marine park and for species and ecosystems within it should protect World Heritage values for which the area was listed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precautionary principle is a significant concept which gives guidance to policy makers so as to avoid, where practicable, possibly serious or irreversible environmental damage which might result directly or indirectly from the development of those policies. It is embodied in the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, which was signed by the Commonwealth and all state governments in 1992. The amendment is, therefore, broadly consistent with government policy on these issues. The government has, therefore, decided to accept this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment deals with another issue. The current Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act already makes provision for the search of arrested persons for offences under section 46A of the act. The bill restricts that power to allow inspectors to conduct only ordinary and frisk searches of arrested persons. Both types of searches are defined in item 1, page 3 of the bill. The bill's provisions bring the search provisions into line with current Commonwealth criminal law policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 37 on page 19 of the bill inserts, amongst other things, proposed new section 46C. Subsection 46C(1) requires that, where practicable, the inspector conducting the search of an arrested person be of the same sex as the arrested person. The amendment seeks to ensure that searches of arrested persons are carried out only by persons of the same sex. Where an inspector of the same sex is not available, another person of the same sex as the arrested person may be requested to conduct the search. The government accepts that this amendment is appropriate and should not lead to problems enforcing the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not be opposing either of the amendments. We wish to confirm our commitment to the precautionary principle but I would like to add a few words on that. Firstly, this was introduced without much notice in the Senate and, secondly, there is some concern at the way in which the precautionary principle can be used. As a principle itself, it is a very good one&mdash;that you just do not go ahead and do anything that is going to have possible serious ramifications in the future to the environment&mdash;but there is a feeling that this principle can be used in some sections just to simply stop anything from happening. Certainly, if you take the principle to its utmost, you cannot prove that anything is not going to cause danger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to acknowledge that this point has been raised with us by developers around the Great Barrier Reef. They do not want to see this used to the absolute degree so that nothing can go ahead around the reef, and we would certainly support that. That does not take away from the fact that we do support the principle, as long as it is used in a sensible manner&mdash;that is, to stop anything that might go ahead that could have ramifications in the future for the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern that I have heard expressed from GBRMPA and up at the reef is the lack of actual resources that have been given by this government to the protection of the reef. It is one thing to bring forth these principles but another thing is that the reef, which is undoubtedly our greatest tourist attraction and which brings in billions to the Commonwealth each year, is not given the resources needed to protect it. I can refer to the lack of funds for sufficient field officers and also for sufficient boats to go up and down the reef to police what is happening to the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the people who best protect the reef are the people who use it for their living. It is in their interests to see that it is protected. I know that they have some concerns about the lack of resources that are given to the protection of the reef, and certainly they have concerns about the lack of consultation that goes on with them. They are there to protect the reef, just as much as the Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee), yet he will frequently not bring them into his considerations when he is looking at legislation on the reef. We would ask the minister perhaps to consider that in future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the members of the ministerial council that looks after the Great Barrier Reef, perhaps I could respond to the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). First, she raised the concern expressed by some developers about adopting the amendment which is currently before the House to ensure that we are following the precautionary principle where possible. I would argue that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been adopting the precautionary principle for many years in seeking to ensure that we strike the right balance between allowing Australians and visitors to Australia to learn about the reef and to utilise that great resource and also ensure that we are not damaging the very thing that has attracted people to the Great Barrier Reef in the first place. The adoption of this might formally place into the legislation a principle which the Marine Park Authority has been using for many years and, therefore, I think that the concern expressed to her by those developers is one that can be dealt with quite adequately by the Marine Park Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue she raised was the argument that the federal government should be providing additional resources to the Marine Park Authority. I think that was the point she was making. I am always amazed by the number of conservative shadow ministers who get up in this House and tell us that the federal government should be spending more in their own portfolio area, or in other shadow ministers' portfolio areas, but whenever there is a debate about the budget or economic policy, the same Liberal spokesmen are saying that the government is spending too much money. Sometimes we think there are actually twins. One of the twins comes in to argue for additional spending and the other twin substitutes to tell us that we are spending too much on important areas such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did take a difficult decision a few years ago to introduce a reef tax. We were kicked around a bit by some opposition members and spokesmen. In North Queensland in particular, many people have argued that this charge of $1 per person per day was an outrageous burden that people had to carry. It is my view that since GBRMPA has sought to ensure that all the funds that are raised from that $1 per person per day are redirected towards an increased effort in research, improvement in providing facilities for visitors and improvement in protecting the reef, that is something which all of us can support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a modest charge such as that, which does end up being spent on research, policing the rules and improving visitor facilities, is a good measure. Certainly, it has not been too popular with some of the people who have had to pay this fee. But if you are spending more than $50 to go out on a boat to visit the reef, an extra $1 per person per day is pretty modest compared with the total sums of money which people spend in visiting the reef. For all of those reasons I note the concerns raised by the shadow minister but I think we have sought to deal with them in the way I have explained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report relating to the refurbishment of Scarborough House and construction of Commonwealth offices at Phillip, ACT, is the committee's first report for 1995. As a matter of principle, I always inform the local member when I am making reference to a project in that member's electorate. This project is in the federal electorate of Canberra and, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, I found some difficulty in informing the local member that I was going to present these reports today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of this proposal, which is sponsored by Australian Estate Management, is to provide modern office accommodation for the Australian Industrial Property Organisation&mdash;AIPO&mdash;which members may be more familiar with under its former title of the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Estate Management is proposing an extensive refurbishment and fit-out of Scarborough House's 14 office floors, ground floor, basement, roof and facade and minor works to the building surrounds. Scarborough House will be upgraded to a standard commensurate with current commercial office building standards. The proposed annex building will consist of a new two-wing, five-level commercial standard office building with central atrium and associated landscaping. The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated outturn cost of $50.38 million at July 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of AEM as the sponsoring agency are to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.provide accommodation to meet the needs of AIPO</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.protect the Commonwealth's investment in Scarborough House by maintaining its income capacity</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.reduce the Commonwealth's overall property costs through a well managed portfolio of owned office buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scarborough House has not had a major upgrade of services, structure or finishes since it was constructed in 1970. The committee was advised at the public hearing by AEM that a condition audit of Scarborough House indicated that it is now well below an acceptable modern commercial office standard particularly in the area of occupational health and safety requirements and is considered to be at the end of its current commercial life. In order to ensure the building retains its value as an asset of the Commonwealth, AEM believes that an extensive refurbishment is now required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIPO has occupied the entire building since 1971. Various options for the redevelopment of Scarborough House have been investigated over recent years with a view to satisfying AIPO's accommodation requirements. A need for a significant increase in space and a need to co-locate in the Woden town centre office precinct had been identified. AIPO believes that the fragmentation of its office accommodation results in inefficiencies and increased costs including time wasted in personnel movement, delivery costs and transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised that a range of options were developed and investigated to satisfy both AIPO's accommodation requirements and to provide the Commonwealth with a satisfactory financial investment. The committee is satisfied that the proposal, which is the subject of this first report for 1995, represents an effective accommodation solution at an affordable cost for AIPO and also provides value for money for the Commonwealth as it extends the useful life of an existing asset and will provide an additional Commonwealth owned office building to meet a long-term need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled recommends redevelopment of housing for service families at the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra, Queensland, at an estimated cost of $7.86 million. It is interesting to contrast the two costs&mdash;$56 million for the bureaucrats in Canberra and $7.86 million for housing our defence warfare centre at Canungra. Families at Canungra are presently living in timber frame houses clad with asbestos sheeting. These pre-1960 style houses are substandard and contribute to personnel and family problems. At the public hearing the tenant consultative group advised the committee that the morale of families currently occupying these houses is at its lowest ebb. The committee inspected this accommodation and agrees that a need exists to provide suitable housing for these defence personnel and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority proposes to remove 47 houses in the Boike Road and Corcoran Crescent precincts. One existing house will be upgraded and 26 houses built in the Corcoran Crescent precinct. Twenty-nine houses will be constructed in the Boike Road precinct. The houses in Corcoran Crescent will be replaced with larger houses on bigger blocks of land. The larger blocks extend beyond the existing lot boundaries but do not encroach on the surrounding bushland. Two-storey houses will be built on the smaller blocks and this will provide a variety of housing in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing at Canungra, the tenant consultative group advised the committee that it is satisfied with the consultative process with the Defence Housing Authority, which has always been willing to listen to its views. The houses will be fitted with earth leakage circuit breakers as well as smoke detectors. The Defence Housing Authority has advised the committee that it has a retrofit program for the installation of earth leakage circuit breakers and smoke detectors in all of its houses already constructed. The committee commends the Defence Housing Authority on this decision. The committee believes that the proposal will provide Defence personnel and their families with good quality housing consistent with community standards. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the bills before the House at the moment are the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill 1994, the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you can appreciate, I was not listed to speak at this point, but I am happy to proceed. The purpose of this package of bills is to give the licensees a power. It is a choice about how they pay their licence fees, either up-front or by instalment, and it introduces a penalty system for the late payment of fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual provisions of these three bills were covered by previous speakers when the legislation was earlier before the House. In summary, firstly, the amendments will allow licensees with licences issued for a period of more than 12 months the choice of paying the total fee for the full period up-front or by instalments. Secondly, under existing arrangements, default of payment can result in the suspension or cancellation of a licence. There is no scope for a period of grace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments would introduce a system whereby persons who default paying their licence by instalment would be charged interest on the late payment and, if still in default, be required to pay the licence fee for the whole period. The actual suspension or cancellation of the licence would then be a last resort. Obviously, under the system as it exists, it is too draconian a measure to take in respect of late payment of fees. This amendment will provide a level of flexibility in the administration of licences. The amendments do not provide for any increase in licence taxes overall. There are some changes within the package of bills in the amount of licence fees to be paid, particularly in respect of amateur broadcasters, but they do provide for a greater flexibility in the manner of payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change of fees for amateur radio licensees, the proposal to restructure the apparatus licence fees by the Spectrum Management Authority, has attracted some criticism from amateur radio operators and their peak body, the Wireless Institute of Australia. I am sure that other members of the House, like me, have received representations from individual constituents who are amateur broadcasters, and some of us have seen some of the material that has been circulated by the WIA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is aware of and responsive to those representations. There is some change being made. The existing fee is $37 per annum. The proposal was that that fee rise to $71 per annum. The result, following deliberations and representations to government, is that that proposed fee has been reduced to $51 per annum&mdash;an increase of some $14 on the existing fee of $37. Given the infrequency with which those rates have been changed, some have suggested that in the context overall it is not an increase of the magnitude that was proposed when it was originally $71. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management of the spectrum is a very difficult issue. Some members may recall that in October of 1991, as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, we tabled our report into the radio frequency spectrum and that work was essentially done by a subcommittee of the full committee. That subcommittee comprised the then deputy chairman of the full committee, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the member for Greenway (Mr Gorman). Our report to the parliament was a unanimous report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we recommended in that report has, to a large extent, been embodied in the subsequent legislation: the establishment of the Spectrum Management Agency. To many people in our community, the radio frequency spectrum is a mystery. They may hear the words and receive the messages over the medium, but as to how it operates and how it is paid for, they have no idea whatsoever. Whilst to some the radio frequency spectrum is a mystery, to others it is almost sacred. It is a fixed, natural resource. We cannot increase the quality of the spectrum available but we can alter and extend its capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened over time is that as technology has improved, become better and better, whilst the spectrum itself is fixed, its capacity to transmit information has gradually&mdash;sometimes in leaps&mdash;been extended. As communication technologies and services rapidly assume a greater role in our society and in economic activity, the effective management of that spectrum is of increasing importance. In those circumstances, it is essential that Australia be positioned to reap the potential benefits of growth, productivity and efficiency that the communications revolution is bringing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of that inquiry, our subcommittee had to come to grips with a complex and difficult subject. We sought in our report to simplify understandings of the issues involved and to set out a course of spectrum management that would take Australia well into the future. It was not an easy issue to deal with because, as I said a few moments ago, to most people it is a mystery and to others it is a right that under no circumstances should be touched or varied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the nation, it is an extremely valuable natural resource. It is managed in a way that protects Australia's international interests. As we have international arrangements in respect of air services, marine safety and air safety, so there are international agreements in respect of the transmission of matter through our spectrum. That has to happen because there are not any fences in space where we can make sure that messages do not come into our air space but, at the same time, there has to be some orderly arrangement. Otherwise, frequencies would be overlapping and the amount of spectrum that we could use would be greatly limited. So there is an international management of the spectrum overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to our conclusions about the management of the spectrum, we decided that there should be clear objectives. Whoever manages the spectrum, be it the Spectrum Management Agency, there should be clear objectives. What had happened was that it was not being well managed. I will come to that in a few moments. The method and system of charging did not lend itself at that time to promoting the most efficient use of this valuable natural resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we as a committee concluded was that spectrum management objectives must be clearly defined, accurate and relevant. Those objectives had to provide well into the future for our nation and cope with the demands that would be placed upon it. They must take into account what we need now, the past and established practices and how to get the best result for Australia in the future. They would also have to take into account the rapid changes and innovations in technology in that field. We also decided that the spectrum management objectives should not impede the achievement of the broader communications objectives of the government of the day, whatever colour it may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We concluded that the objectives should define spectrum management from an operational perspective, with a view to maximising the availability of spectrum to all users for all purposes. The two significant objectives from the operational perspective are dynamic and technical efficiency&mdash;dynamic efficiency in the capacity of the spectrum to accept new and improving technology. In other words, how it copes and how efficiently it can cope with new technology. We had to make sure that that was provided for. By technical efficiency, we mean how well we are using the available spectrum. By spectrum, we are talking about how well we manage the airwaves and how we can maximise the use made of the airwaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As new equipment is developed over the decades, in many instances the best technology is not being used or has not been used for one reason or another. There is better and better technology available which enables us to have more broadcasters operating on more frequencies than were being utilised. If we look at the amount of spectrum taken up by TV stations or by AM or FM radio stations, we see that there is a finite limit as to how many broadcasters can fit in that space on the spectrum or on the available airwaves. We made recommendations in the report that we feel will help government and the system to provide for that improved technical efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also raised the question of whether the system, as it existed in 1981, could meet the needs of public and merit goods. While that system of spectrum management met the needs of users who provided socially beneficial services to the community, regard had to be made for the community organisations who were using the spectrum for non-profit purposes and were providing a public service&mdash;organisations such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service, ambulances and the bushfire brigades. Consideration also had to be given to ensuring that the best possible use is made over time of such a valuable natural resource as the airwaves. That led to how to fairly allocate the use of that spectrum to the highest value. As technology improved, the utilisation of it increased, particularly in the area of mobile telephones, which became heavily congested. The demand for that section of the spectrum was greater than there was spectrum available. Yet the system, as it existed, did not enable easy increased use to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We found that the approach to levying charges for access to the spectrum had little if any effect on managing demand and did not promote the efficient use of the spectrum. That was not visible or clear to people who used the system. We find this repeatedly in our electorates. People were saying, `I pay this fee'&mdash;then it was to the Department of Transport and Communications, now it is to the SMA&mdash;`but what do they do for it? I do not see anything for it; it is just a donation or another tax.' What we want to see from the Spectrum Management Agency in the future is a system of charging that identifies the components of the fee that people are paying. Those components were broken down. It was then said that they were paying a tax. There was always a tax component, but it was not identified as such. When earlier governments of both political complexions decided to increase fees, part of the reason was simply to raise more revenue. What went up was the licence fee. Often that increase bore no relationship to costs; it was simply to get some return on a fixed natural resource that belonged to the nation. We had to look at that issue, which I will come back to a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We looked at the whole situation and saw that there were four options. We could have an administrative system for setting priorities for allocation and assignment. We could have finetuned the existing administrative system. We could have moved fully, as some strong submissions from some quarters and a study by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics suggested, to a market based system. Those who could afford to pay the highest price for the use of the airwaves would be given use of the airwaves. The fourth option was to have a mixed system with regard to existing users, the common and public merit good that I referred to earlier and the need to free up the spectrum to allow people to have fixed tenure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Theoretically, what was happening was that any licence  granted was for only 12 months and never beyond that. Honourable members might recall that radio stations changed hands for very large amounts of money, yet all they had was a licence to broadcast on that frequency for one year. Since there has only ever been one instance where a licence was not extended beyond the year, it was always assumed that licences would be renewed. However, under the law, they were renewed for only one year. That was an unsatisfactory situation. What the industry sought very largely was a fixed tenure system. That is why in this legislation there is reference to the period in which a licence is granted of up to five years. So there is a fixed tenure on that frequency. That enables people holding licences in the commercial sector to trade those licences because they have a five-year licence. They can sell them for that period, and at the end they come up again. We recommended that a fixed tenure come into it, and that has been adopted. But there has to be a gradual move to the new system, and that is what the legislation has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing in these three bills is changing some of the contributions being made to the costs but not the overall revenue being collected. We should make that point abundantly clear because some people say, `Yes, but you are saying you are not changing the overall revenue.' And the word `overall' gets dropped out. But there are individual changes in that overall revenue that are being increased. There have been increases and decreases, but overall the revenue is the same. In the case of amateur radio licence users, I can well understand that some of our constituents are concerned. But when you put that into the perspective of the reduction in the proposed fee, I think that is a figure which a lot of our constituents and our now 20,000 amateur radio broadcasters will find more comfortable. They will be more able to adjust to that fee than the proposed $71, which was almost a doubling in one leap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section of the airwaves or the radio frequency spectrum occupied by radio amateur broadcasters is highly sought after by other users. Amateurs have access to 44 blocks of spectrum in 23 bands. That is well above what is available in other countries. The 20,000 amateur radio broadcasters use 179 times more spectrum than the estimated 800,000 CB operators in Australia. They use significantly more power than CBs. They use a 400-watt transmission compared to a 12-watt transmission. The amount of spectrum, the range of the airwaves used by amateur broadcasters, runs second only to the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that when our constituents and the amateur radio broadcasters are looking at this question overall they can accept, like the rest of us, that this is a very valuable natural resource. We are trying to move it around so that the nation can get the best possible use out of that natural resource. But as I said, amateur broadcasters are not a small piece of the spectrum. They occupy one of the most valuable parts of the spectrum and use a very large proportion of it. They also receive other services from the Spectrum Management Agency. They have regular consultation with the amateur peak body, the WIA, and the Spectrum Management Agency represents amateur interests internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So these things just do not happen by nature, there have to be international arrangements. The amateurs need to be represented in the international fora where these decisions are taken. Overall, amateur radio has a very valuable role to play. It provides activity and interest for many of those 20,000 Australians, but many of them also contribute to community services in other ways, as other organisations are dedicated just to community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend them for the contribution and service they provide to the Australian nation. I commend them for their interest in wireless and in the use of the radio frequency spectrum generally. I feel that what we have been able to achieve with these revised increases in licence fees is something that is going to be much more acceptable than the original proposal. I commend the bills to the House. </PARA>

The government right from the outset of this legislation has got the whole question of radio spectrum management wrong. The proposal to increase the licence fee for amateur radio services was initially put forward by the government without, in our view, any proper consultation or publicly stated and convincing justification for those increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Spectrum Management Agency failed to adequately explain how it had arrived at the proposed fee levels. Although we have been told by the parliamentary secretary in the course of the debate on this bill what these fees will cover, it is still not entirely clear just how those fee levels have been arrived at and why the fees that are now being announced&mdash;and these were the revised fees that were announced by the parliamentary secretary&mdash;differed from the original fees which were put forward by the government. One can only assume that the changes that have been made were in response to the public outcry which accompanied the initial announcements about the fee increases. I am sure that every member in this House would have received representations from some of the 20,000 amateur radio licensees throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of consultation that occurred is quite deplorable. The first the amateur radio licensees knew about this was when a leak from the Spectrum Management Agency filtered out into the community and people heard via the grapevine that the licence fees to be introduced this year by the Spectrum Management Agency would,in fact, more than double in some cases. Some of the licence fees were going from $25 to $67. That was quite outrageous. It is no wonder that I heard from many of the constituents in my electorate who were indicating their concern about the large scale increase by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did have a lot of representations about it. I received representations from Mr Taylor, operator of amateur radio station VK3FQ from Tandara; Mr M.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had other letters and complaints about this increase. It is no wonder that these people complained because the government did not consult with these organisations at all. There was no contact with them. The government just jacked up the fees, the structure, without proper consultation by the department, and it falls into line really with the massive increases in indirect taxes that this government has been perpetrating on the Australian community for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total individual tax&mdash;and these figures are based on the 1994-95 budget estimates&mdash;has increased since 1983 under a federal Labor government by 136.8 per cent. The total indirect tax&mdash;and this is what we are talking about with this spectrum management pricing policy&mdash;has increased by 125.4 per cent. Is it any wonder that the government is looking at every opportunity to increase taxes on a whole range of things, including amateur radio licences?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amateur radio operators over the years have performed a very valuable volunteer service throughout Australia. During fire periods, particularly in the fire prone areas of Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales, the amateur radio volunteers actually act as a backup service for emergency communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the story of how the amateur radio licence operators in Darwin alerted Australia to the oncoming Cyclone Tracy which devastated much of Darwin. It was the amateur radio operators who indicated to the emergency services that this cyclone was approaching and that it was heading towards Darwin. I have also had personal experience of the amateur radio people during the period of the Ash Wednesday fires in Victoria. Many of the normal communications systems were wiped out during those fires and we had to resort to the amateur radio operators. These volunteers were only too willing to help. They provided an additional communications system to make contact with police, the State Emergency Services, and the Country Fire Authority during those horrific fires in 1982 in Victoria on Ash Wednesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the government to now look at the amateur radio operators as some sort of milch cow, and increase taxes for their licences to the extent that they did without consultation, was quite inappropriate. Is it any wonder that we had all of those amateur radio licence operators protesting to us as local members. I am sure that the government would have received an enormous amount of correspondence on this. I certainly did.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amateurs have no alternative but to pay whatever is asked, because if they don't pay they lose their licence.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's been said that Australia wide the CB licences would create an income of $6 million, compare this to the $6 hundred thousand from the amateur ranks.

<PARA>They asked me as their local member to put their case to parliament, and I agreed to do so. I received a number of letters all in a similar vein. There was one in particular from Michael O'Burtill from Heathcote. He raised the question of the volunteer service that amateur radio provides to the community. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amateur Radio is of immense benefit to the community. There are many instances where it has played a crucial and important part in providing emergency communications where civil and military systems have been unable to perform. e.g. Communications from Darwin following Cyclone Tracy, bushfires in each State, earthquakes in NSW etc.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from those letters to highlight the importance of the amateur radio network. Those operators recognise that they are providing a community service to the whole community; it is not just for the purposes of having a hobby. I think they are incorporating a system as a backup not only to the civil communications system but also to the military system. That was particularly evident in their communications network that was in place during Cyclone Tracy and the clean-up process afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also received comment from a pensioner in my electorate who is interested in amateur radio and who operates an amateur radio station. He indicated to me that it is a hobby for him. He is a legally blind pensioner, and it is one of the few interests that he can participate in. He has great difficulty in doing lots of things because of his eyesight, but he said that this is an interest. He feels that he can pay a service to the community by participating in amateur radio and by keeping up his contact with a whole range of people and organisations. He said that the increase of almost 100 per cent in the annual fee would wipe him out. He would not be able to afford it on his pension. He would not be able to afford the proposed increase that the government was considering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly agree and sympathise with his comments about that. Most of the amateur radio people I know have spent quite a lot of money setting up their hobby, and they provide that service to the community at their own expense. They were willing to pay a modest fee but not the fee the government proposed, which was an increase of 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the outcry from amateur radio operators, the parliamentary secretary indicated to the House that there would be changes. I note that no explanation for the changes was given to the House. The House was also not informed of the criteria for establishing those fees. We do not really know now whether at some future time the government will try this stunt again. We do not really know what criteria the Spectrum Management Agency used to establish that level of increase and that level of fee. Obviously, amateur radio licensees are now looking very closely at this and wondering whether the government will at some other time&mdash;when things are quiet and the government thinks the coast is clear and everyone has forgotten the issue&mdash;just slide it through again and increase those fees without establishing criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is up to the government and the Spectrum Management Agency to spell out the way in which these fees are calculated and to justify the fee increases to the amateur radio licence holders. That is now the concern of the amateur radio operators. They really do not know what the future holds for them. They have just had a victory. They have used the strength of 20,000 members to bring a bit of pressure to bear on the government. The government has responded because of the force of the complaints it received, but the amateur radio licence holders are now saying to me, `Let's see the criteria. How did it set the fees? How were the reduced fees set and how can we cope with this in the future?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these questions are justified. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) now needs to consider what message he transmits back to these amateur radio people. The government needs to ensure that, if it or the Spectrum Management Agency put forward any proposal in the future, it goes out to the community and the operators. The government knows who they all are. They are all licensed. The government has a record of them and it would be a simple matter of contacting them or their organisations. If any proposed increases are mooted, the government should be honest with these people. It should not do a behind-the-scenes deal and jack up the price of the licence by 100 per cent. Regrettably, this is the way the government has been operating since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I referred to earlier, total indirect taxes have increased in Australia by 125.4 per cent. It follows the government's normal procedure of `Get the dollar where you can. It does not matter about any consultation, just keep on increasing it, irrespective of the services these people provide for the community'. When you see that sort of arrogance being portrayed in a bill like this&mdash;which affects so many people who provide a community service&mdash;is it any wonder the people of Canberra rejected the arrogant behaviour of the government last Saturday? Is it any wonder 22,000 people rejected the government, moved across and provided a 16.4 per cent swing to the Liberal member coming into this House? It is no wonder when you see the arrogant approach the government has adopted with amateur radio people. It has tried to increase their costs by 100 per cent. It is an attitude displayed right throughout the government's operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table: it is time for the government to take stock of all of these indirect taxes and charges it is devising behind the scenes and without consultation with a whole range of people. It is adding to costs and also to the pressure people in the community are feeling at the moment. People are feeling pressure not just from interest rates; the government keeps on increasing a whole range of other taxes and charges, all of which add to people's costs of living. It makes those who provide valuable voluntary work in the community very angry. It is time the government took heed of the warning and consulted people on issues like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the cognate debate on the radiocommunications amendment bills. I want to pick up from where the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) ended. There appears to be no real validity in the government increasing the fees on this. It would be quite different if the Spectrum Management Agency actually did give us the criteria on why it is increasing the fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radiocommunications is a hobby for many people&mdash;and the government does not go around taxing every hobby&mdash;and we wonder why the government wants to impose a tax on these people. The only reason we can come up with is that the government is hard up for money. It did not get its budget right last year and now it is penny pinching. It is penny pinching at every opportunity it can find. In this case, there is a group of people who enjoy a hobby of being involved in amateur radio. They are very easily identified, so the government can target them. There appears to be no sensitivity by the government to the fact that these people provide a community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, we find this government interested only in economic issues. The government has mismanaged the economy. The overseas debt is enormous now. It has gone up by 700 per cent under this government. We were told by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) only three or four weeks ago that the budget deficit has blown out by millions of dollars. The government now has its back to the wall and has to find every opportunity to raise money from hard-pressed Australian taxpayers. At the same time, under this government over the last 12 years, real wage increases have decreased. Therefore, the standard of living of people, instead of increasing, has actually gone down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another indirect tax being imposed on Australian families. It would be different if the Spectrum Management Agency in the communications department would actually tell us that there are some objective criteria for why these fees should go up. Is the agency doing extra work? Is it providing an extra service to the amateur radio operators? From what I have been told, the answer is a very clear no. But, instead, the government just decides that it can lob an extra fee onto these people involved in a hobby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard from several speakers in this House, the amateur radio operators provide a very important community service. In Tasmania, which is an island state in the Commonwealth, this service often involves details of shipping movements or people who are out to sea&mdash;fishermen or whomever. The amateur radio operators are sometimes the first people to pick up information and they are able to transmit that information on for community benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard about other situations such as the cyclone in Darwin and the bushfires in Hobart. There are many instances. Another situation which often occurs in Tasmania involves people hiking through some of the wilderness areas of the state. Sometimes the first messages come from people who are close by who are ham radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this proposal by the government, there is no option for the opposition but to oppose it. What I find interesting about this whole issue is the way in which the communications department seems to operate. On three or four different occasions since I have been in parliament, the communications department has appeared to me to be one of those departments which has not known whether it is coming or going. For example, I refer to the issuing of community radio licences. The government can sometimes change the rules for applying for those licences every 18 months. It is a disgrace for a Commonwealth department to be doing that type of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently certain areas of Australia were changed from VHF to UHF. The department certainly seems to regard most of Australia as plain country where the radio beams or TV waves will go across very easily. But, with hilly topography, you have enormous problems. Twelve months later, people in some communities in my area of Tasmania are still not getting any TV. We asked the department about nine months ago to try to rectify this and it said, `There is no way we are going to put up any transmitters.' People then went out and spent $400 or $500&mdash;some up to $1,000&mdash;to try to get TV. Now the government is starting to say, `Maybe there is no other alternative. We'll have to come in and put up four or five transmitters to get into these different valleys so that people can get their TV.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no forethought by the department; there was no thinking through of the issue. On this occasion, in regard to radiocommunications and these fees, again there has been no logical statement put out by the department. For example, where are the criteria? People out there are asking, `Why can't the government get its act together and ask its department to put down the extra service it is providing to the Australian people, in this case the amateur radio licence operators?' Most Australians are prepared to pay more if they get a better service, but the reality is that they are not going to get a better service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be different if the government were actually the providers of the radio waves, but we all know that the radio waves are managed on a global basis. Nobody can give out the bands for radio waves. The decision of which bands go out is not an Australian decision; it is made internationally. In other countries, as we have been told, they do not pay for licences or, in quite a number of cases, they pay a very small amount for licences. It is regarded as a community resource and has been used for years and years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this I see a government which is penny-pinching, which is only interested in getting money because of its mismanagement of the economy overall, which is not really interested in the community concerns of having people out there who might be able to help somebody who is in distress and which is not interested in what Australians as individuals or families can do in the community. The government just believes that government in Canberra can control things and has the power to do things and that ordinary people out there should pay for it if the government in Canberra wants to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the government that this is an area in which, with just a little more work, the government could have argued its case, but it has not. People out there are angry. They feel isolated because the government has not done its homework and the department has not done the work that it should have to let the operators know why it is increasing the fees. I fully support our position in opposing this type of fee increase. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join with my National and Liberal Party colleagues in strongly opposing the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 and cognate bills currently before the House. They will considerably increase amateur radio licence fees. It is important to remember that there are approximately 20,000 amateur radio operators in Australia, all of whom provide a voluntary community service. The legislation before the House is nothing more and nothing less than a tax increase on a hobby.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worry that the government does not yet appreciate the community service provided by amateur radio operators. For this reason, I wish to bring directly to the attention of the House the concerns of only a couple of my many constituents who reject the government's reasoning&mdash;so much of it as is known&mdash;for increasing the licence fees. Mr Bob Neal, who is President of the East Gippsland Amateur Radio Club, made a submission to me. Mr Neal opposes the then 100 per cent increase in amateur radio licence fees which the government has now amended to become a 50 per cent increase. I will come to that issue shortly. Mr Neal stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a number of voice repeater stations throughout the area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is East Gippsland&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">such as Mt. Nowa Nowa, Mt. Cann, Mt. Taylor and Mt. Hotham, with a further station near Mallacoota in the near future. We have equipment under construction to link all of these repeaters together so that a person-mobile or home station can communicate throughout almost the whole area of East Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of amateur radio operators is felt nowhere more than in isolated or relatively remote rural areas. A number of my colleagues representing rural areas have made that point. Representing the constituency of Gippsland, which has a huge coastline, I particularly value the work of the amateur radiocommunications network. Mr Neal went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these facilities are being provided from club funds and by volunteer labour of members and some $2,250 has been expended over the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These repeaters, because of their strategic location, are very useful in the least populated areas where other communication means are absent. We have on file, letters of appreciation for assistance rendered through the Mt. Hotham repeater during a Police search a short time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of our club members are also members of the Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network (WICEN) and our representatives attend the regular Displan meetings in the area and make our communications system available in case of any emergency. We assist in community events such as the forthcoming Marley Point Yacht race . . . where some twenty-one amateurs from the area will be setting up a special communications system of voice and packet radio to assist the Water Police and the Paynesville Rescue Squad with safety aspects of the race and general information on boat positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a good working relationship with the Gippsland Repeater Association and carry out technical maintenance on many of their systems as a community service.</PARA>
<PARA>The Gippsland Repeater Association is a voluntary body. I pay tribute to the work of its members, particularly Bill Morris of Maffra. Mr Neal continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We also assist Scout Groups with communications during cross-country exercises and during the JOTA weekend in October made our equipment available for Scouts and Guides to talk to other groups around the world. Because of the range of frequencies available in amateur radio, it is possible to provide point to point communications to almost any part of the earth at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other community services of amateur radio members of our club includes the tracking down of interfering transmitters on the Marine Emergency channels, locating interfering transmissions to UHF television reception and seeking out transmitters that were interfering with UHF CB repeaters. These matters are rightly the responsibility of the SMA, however . . . no local staff are available to carry out these investigations and a sum of money is required by the SMA before they will start this type of investigation. The amateur radio operators are the only persons in a community like East Gippsland who have the equipment and skills to perform these sorts of tasks. A voluntary community service that is not being performed by Government regulators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is done by a small group of licensed radio amateurs in one of the more sparsely populated areas of the state and there are many other similar groups throughout this state and the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach developed by the SMA to our licence fees seems to better fit the commercial operator rather than amateurs, who are forbidden to make financial gain from their operation, and it seems particularly unfair when we see the citizens band operators, who we help with technical support, exempted from any licence fees. Likewise our American amateur friends have not paid licence fees for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also worth drawing to the attention of the House points made by Mr Rowan Smith of Raymond Island. He wrote to me in February this year to protest against the Spectrum Management Agency's proposal to increase amateur radio licence fees. Mr Smith stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I am sure you are aware, of the enormous benefit to the community, that amateur radio operators make in times of crises, whether it be a national disaster in the form of bush fires or floods or just volunteer assistance for community events, such as long distance cycling events, or in Gippsland, the Marley Point Yacht Race along with major scouting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Emergency Network . . . has become incorporated in "Displan" which is heavily relied upon by the Victorian Police as a necessary part in their Disaster Plan management.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your support to have this "Tax" proposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was put forward by the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">revoked would be greatly appreciated as I think that this could lead to the demise of Amateur Radio as we know it in Australia. The SMA recently decided to relinquish the licence fee required by "Citizen Band" radio operators, it therefore follows that the same consideration could apply to Amateurs who are far fewer in number, but well regimented under the auspices of the Wireless Institute of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Amateur Radio service is a World-Wide service, I would like to know if you would be in favour of proposing two alternatives to the SMA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)That the SMA charge a "once only" Licence fee on completion of the necessary examinations, to cover the administrative costs of issuing the Licence, which would be sanctioned by the WIA; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)That the SMA should follow the practice adopted in the United States where Licensed operators are totally free of any Licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Smith wishes to know the government's attitude in relation to alternatives to increasing amateur radio licence fees. It is also worth quoting Robynne Saxton of Bruthen, who can summarise the ethics and purpose of amateur radio operators extremely well. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I support the Amateur Radio Operators in their stand against the higher fees as they do a lot for the community in which they pay for themselves out of their own pocket, eg, scouts, yacht racers, communication in natural disasters, etc.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Ms Saxton has summed it up very nicely. Does the government really understand the importance of amateur radio licence operators and the effect that this increase in licence fees will have on the network? I suggest&mdash;although I am happy to be convinced otherwise by the government&mdash;that the answer to both those questions is no. In speaking to the bills before the House on 8 March 1995, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) had this to say in a self-congratulatory tone:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . amateurs were paying $37 per annum but under the formula being applied to apparatus licences in general, their annual fee would have increased to a maximum of $71.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to announce that the SMA has further considered the level of fees to be applied to amateurs in the light of the public benefit that amateurs provide to the community, and that a lower overall fee is now proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the SMA has decided to reduce the tax component of the licence fees to the minimum level. This will reduce the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. The fee would be applied to all amateur licences.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a cause for celebration&mdash;I don't think! The fees will be increased from $37 per annum to a maximum of $51 per annum instead of an increase to a proposed $71 maximum. The parliamentary secretary continued in his presentation, in a very complacent tone, to the House on 8 March 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While $51 represents a small increase on fees paid for many years by amateurs, the new fee is based on the administration and maintenance services provided to this group be the Spectrum Management Agency . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Fifty-one dollars represents a small increase! Talk about adding insult to injury. It still represents a 50 per cent increase in the licence fees. I do not think the government should be congratulating itself just yet. We still do not know the basis for this calculation in the increase in the licence fees. It all seems so ad hoc and haphazard. How can the government propose an increase to $71 only a few weeks ago but now reduce that increase to $51? What is the logic? How has it saved $20 overnight? How does it justify the increase in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary has spoken of the need to reimburse the SMA for the cost of issuing the licences, managing interference to their services, issuing and registering call signs, accredited examinations and representing amateur interests and internal negotiations. They are generalisations. We would need a breakdown of the costs of the SMA before we could possibly agree to any sort of increase. The opposition, despite its best efforts, has not been able to find any adequate, let alone compelling, explanation for how the SMA has arrived at the proposed fee levels. The SMA has certainly not factored in the extent of the community benefits of amateur radio licence operators. Moreover, there appears to have been little and certainly inadequate consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So neither the justification nor the consultation has been established by the SMA. In these circumstances, the opposition opposes the increase. We simply have to put the interest of the amateur radio community and the valuable service it provides to all Australians ahead of the government's determination to use it as an easy source of revenue. These are taxation bills before the House, not recompense for expenses incurred by the SMA in managing the amateur radio communications network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dedication and commitment of amateur radio operators have been demonstrated time and again by members from this side of the House. To be an amateur radio operator requires a level of dedication which is not found in many other hobbies. The amateur radio operators have to pass three exams at a 70 per cent pass level in order to gain a certificate. That stands in stark contrast to the 300,000 CB radio operators in Australia who do not have to pass an examination and do not pay a licence fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has completely misread the whole situation. It is penalising a vital component of rural  communities and will severely restrict the capability of the radio telecommunications network. As a member of a rural community, I value the work of amateur radio operators, as do their own local communities. We cannot allow a government to use them as a milch cow. </PARA>

It said, `Let's target a figure of $71 and then, if we finish up somewhere short of that, these amateur radio operators will in some way be relieved and grateful.' As the representations to my office and to the office of the member for Gippsland and all other opposition members have indicated, these are professional people who have seen the government coming and have recognised that they were about to be used simply as a means of raising revenue. Because this is a revenue raising measure, as the member for Gippsland has made perfectly clear, we intend to oppose this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I found a little amusing about the legislation&mdash;I do not mean this as any criticism of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott)&mdash;was the constant reference throughout the legislation to `apparatus licensees'. The very term `apparatus' is in itself a bit like the term `amateur'. It implies that there is someone there dealing with something put together over the workbench in the back garage in order to communicate with the rest of the world. The reality, as we all know, is that these professional amateur radio operators have high-tech equipment at their disposal and a capacity to communicate when all else fails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Gippsland has already made the very valid point that these are men and women who have to go through three exams and achieve a 70 per cent pass rate in order to qualify as licensees. This compares dramatically with CB operators. The CB operators, as you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as we are all aware, while a majority are very good and responsible, cause us the most angst when it comes to complaints about interference. The minority are those most responsible for the interruption to the airwaves, cause all sorts of interruption with other services and communicate in language that the rest of society would find unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise that the terms `apparatus licensees', which I know is used with good intent, and `amateur radio' tend to give the wrong impression about what is a professional and essential emergency service. The member for Gippsland has made the point&mdash;I want to echo it&mdash;that there has been no shortage of instances where, in an emergency, various first-aid measures have depended on amateur radio operators to get the message about what was needed either across the street or around the globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many instances we have learnt about catastrophes around the world or about people who are individually at risk at sea or in some other situation simply as a result of the capacity of amateur radio operators to get this message through. It is unfair to treat these people as if they were amateurs. It is unfair to treat them as if they were running nothing more than a sport or a hobby. They need to be seen as people who have played a key role in keeping communications alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all communicators. We know what it is to be able to convince people to a point of view by meeting them eyeball to eyeball to discuss a matter with them. From time to time we even use the telephone to make a particular point and we think we have convinced somebody. We need to recognise that amateur radio operators maintain the best tradition of communication. They pick up where, in a sense, Marconi left off because they take up this task of communicating with people across the globe when all else fails and of maintaining that communication so that any sort of barrier that may exist is broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any one of us who has been approached by amateur radio operators will be aware of the work they do in international relations, of the people with whom they carry on a conversation and of the bridges they build between different cultures because they share a common language. While that common language may not be as simple as merely communicating in English, it is a common language because they have a common interest and that common interest overrides any other divisions they may have&mdash;be they political, religious, cultural or anything else. There needs to be greater recognition that these so-called amateur operators play a key role in emergency situations and have played and continue to play a key role in breaking down barriers and building international relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dilemma this House faces is that we have the parliamentary secretary&mdash;well intentioned maybe&mdash;proposing an increase in the licence fee which does nothing more than generate more revenue. The opposition finds itself opposed to this increase because the increase goes not from $37 to $71, once figured by amateur radio operators, but to this neutral figure of $51. It still represents, as the member for Gippsland has clearly said, an increase in the licence fee charged to amateur radio operators, many of whom are pensioners and many of whom are people who have retired and are looking for an interest with which to pursue the fascination they have with communication. In so doing, the vast majority of them are involved in giving us an additional emergency service monitoring and in building our international relations. We think they deserve a better deal from the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of radiocommunications amendment bills seeks to implement one of the key recommendations of the Spectrum Management Agency's inquiry, which was concluded last year, into the apparatus licence system. That recommendation was for a more flexible system of payment of taxes for apparatus licences. Currently, the only payment option available to holders of apparatus licences is to make an annual fee or, as has been described, a tax payment throughout the duration of the licence. This will change particularly for long-term licensees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a licence is issued for 12 months or less, the annual licence fee will fall due at issue, as is currently the case. However, where the licences are issued for more than 12 months, greater payment options exist, including to pay the annual tax or fees, if you like, up-front as a lump sum payment, to pay the taxes on issue and then on subsequent anniversaries or to pay the taxes in annual instalments and then notify the SMA if you want to pay the balance of annual instalments as a lump sum. This greater flexibility in payment options for licensees has been encouraged by the industry and is certainly welcomed by the coalition as a sensible reform, especially if it helps improve the tax fee recovery for those users of the radio frequency spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are a number of other reforms affecting the spectrum users that the SMA has or is in the process of implementing that do not require legislation. One of those is the simplification of licence categories. According to the recently released SMA report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the apparatus licence system&mdash;a new outlook</EMPHASIS>, the SMA will replace the current set of 104 licence categories with 60 new transmitter licence types and three new receiver types. The new transmitter and receiver licence types are divided into a number of subtypes for purposes of attaching conditions to the licences. For instance, amateur radio will have seven subtypes ranging from amateur repeater to unrestricted, for which different regulations and licence fees will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to another and probably the most controversial of the SMA reforms for spectrum users, especially amateur radio operators&mdash;the SMA's new apparatus licence fee structure. By law, the SMA is able to set charges for its services. In essence, the SMA alone has the power to determine the amount of tax, or fees, for transmitter and receiver licences. The new pricing framework developed by the SMA is a new tripartite fee structure. It includes a spectrum access tax based on the location and the amount of spectrum access, a spectrum maintenance charge and an administrative charge that will cover the issuing of a licence, including the assignment of a frequency, renewing a licence or processing a fee instalment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SMA does not expect the federal government to gain any additional revenue from spectrum users as a result of the new fee structure. It says that the overall level of revenue collected will be the same, except that under the new structures some users will pay more and some will pay less. However, one particular group of spectrum users, the amateur radio operators, will still be worse off under a new licence fee structure, even despite the government's eleventh hour backdown on 8 March. I use 8 March in the context of this speech because that is the date when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) brought it to our attention. It may well be that the government made that decision a day or two earlier, but I just want to put my comments in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to 8 March, the annual licence fee for amateur radio operators was set to rise between $8 and $34 depending on the category. The highest level of fee for the unrestricted amateur was expected to be about $71 per annum. According to the amateur radio operators themselves, the average licence fee was expected to almost double from $39 to $69 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 March, however, the parliamentary secretary announced that the government would reduce the tax component of the licence fee to the minimum level. This will reduce the maximum fee from the proposed $71 down to $51 per annum. However, the $51 still represents a fee increase for most amateur radio operators of around $14 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary suggests that the government and the SMA always intended that a final round of consultation would take place before the fees were set. But I believe this eleventh hour decision is a sign of a government somewhat in disarray over the matter. I see it also as somewhat of a victory for both the coalition and Australia's 20,000 amateur radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many amateur radio operators still have real concerns about this new fee structure. Rockhampton radio operator Ted Roberts, whose call sign is VK4QI and who has been licensed since 1939&mdash;that is a long time to be an amateur radio operator&mdash;is one such opponent. Take the spectrum access tax which is based on a complex formula taking account of spectrum location, geographic location, channel occupied and the area covered&mdash;it must have been thought up by a bureaucrat. While this tax component has now been reduced, Mr Roberts has described it as `the most unacceptable of all rip-offs put forward'. He says, `This is the first time I have heard of a tax on a specific hobby.' Further, he says that amateur radio operators already pay their share of indirect taxes on the equipment they use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His other major concern about the fee structure is the spectrum maintenance charge component, which is worked out as a set percentage of the spectrum access tax. The maintenance charge is meant to cover the SMA's spectrum management costs, as well as the international coordination, domestic planning and interference investigations. Mr Roberts asks how they can claim such a fee when it is believed that an international treaty requires the SMA to maintain the orderly operation of this service. In other words, is it not just a passing of the buck?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Irrespective of whether you agree with the new licence pricing formula or not, let us look at what revenue is expected to be raised by the SMA and the government under this new system. Amateur radio operators estimate that the current fees raise about $685,000 or $0.7 million per annum. Up to 8 March under the proposed licence fee structure, these ham operators were expected to contribute about $1.3 million. Now, because of the 28 per cent reduction in fees announced by the parliamentary secretary on that date, they are likely to contribute about $0.94 million. To put this into perspective, that is about half of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) paid for his North Sydney mansion. In terms of the SMA's budget, which I am told currently runs at $80 million or more, the new contribution from amateur radio operators can be likened to a drop in the bucket. In fact, to collect it is quite mean spirited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare that with Australia's one million CB radio users who, as of October last year, were regarded as class licence operators and therefore not required to contribute any licence fees to the SMA. While I am not advocating for a minute that CB operators should have to pay licence fees, the revenue forgone in this category of spectrum users is around $6 million annually. The SMA and the government are happy to give Australia's one million CB operators free recognition for their part in the utilisation of the radio frequency spectrum but want to slug the small, insignificant and non-profit group of amateurs&mdash;the ham radio operators&mdash;with higher licence fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I appreciate that amateur and CB are quite different services and that amateur radio uses a greater part of the spectrum&mdash;I was interested to hear my colleague the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) say that this runs to about 179 times more spectrum than the CB operators use&mdash;the government bureaucrats, in their haste to come up with a new, exact and technically equitable pricing formula based on spectrum usage, have forgotten one terribly important aspect, and that is the human element. Amateur radio operators are mostly pensioners or returned service men and women; people on low incomes for whom amateur radio has been a lifetime hobby. They may be disabled people, with radio being their only connection with the outside world. They cherish very much, as a couple of speakers have mentioned earlier, their international linkages. It is their hobby; it is their sport; and, for some of them, it is their only recreational outlet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people, through the scout and guide movements, learn to use the simple and accessible technology of amateur radio. Amateur radio is, of course, a very important radio network in times of emergency when civil and military systems have become inoperative. This was demonstrated when Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin. It was also demonstrated during the Newcastle earthquake. As the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) mentioned, it has been used frequently in Victoria in bushfire situations, including the Ash Wednesday fires and many times before and since in various towns and regions right around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Is this the way we thank our long-respected amateur radio service&mdash;by bumping up licence fees by $14 per annum for these operators who always give generously of their time to the community? Other countries such as the United States recognise the contribution of amateur radio networks and do not charge licence fees. Why then should we single out our own amateur operators? I am glad that the parliamentary secretary is here because I would like to hear his comments on that when he sums up. As I said before, I think it is mean spirited to bump up these fees by $14 a year when other countries with a similar outlook to Australia do not find it necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I recognise that there will be fee concessions for apparatus licence holders, including amateur radio operators, where the licensee will pay only the administration and spectrum maintenance charge components, but I still do not think that goes far enough. These concessions are limited to emergency organisations like the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the bush fire brigades, whereas the network of amateurs who can and have been called on in times of crisis is much wider than this formal grouping. Despite the government's last-minute backdown, the whole exercise amounts to penny-pinching by the government which, through the SMA, is trying to squeeze a minority group of spectrum users for what at the end of the day will be very little gain. I repeat: it would be $0.94 million out of a total budget of $80 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments are supposed to care about people. It should care especially about this group which not only serves the country but, as I said before, comes from a fairly select group of people&mdash;some old, some pensioners, some disabled&mdash;who see this as their sport, their recreation and their hobby. Nevertheless, I welcome the government's concession of 8 March, but still question the morality of targeting a valued and mostly defenceless group such as the amateur radio community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While we are on this subject of the spectrum, quite often when the matter of the wider use of the spectrum in commercial radio and television comes up, when we cannot get a service into a particular area, we are told that it is a dimension of the spectrum. So, turning away from the plight of these radio amateur radio operators to this broader issue of spectrum use and management, I wish to highlight concerns about the poor reception of radio and television services in parts of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the responsibilities of the SMA, along with the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the wider Department of Communications, is to allocate transmission frequencies for radio and television services. One particular problem area that has been brought to my attention is that of TV reception in the town of Miriam Vale and surrounding areas in central Queensland. Miriam Vale sits about halfway between Bundaberg and Rockhampton on the Bruce Highway. Miriam Vale residents are able to pick up ABC TV on a VHF channel relayed via a nearby transmitter on the Westwood Range to the east of the town. The signals for Channel 7, VHF, and Channels 9 and 10, both UHF, come from a tower on Mount Goonaneman near Childers, about 200 kilometres from Miriam Vale. So here we have a major town on the Bruce Highway, at the centre of the Miriam Vale shire and near to the expanding Agnes Water 1770 subregion, which has been described by many as `the next Noosa', and local residents are only able to regularly receive one of the four TV channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Miriam Vale residents like Pam and Gil Ward are understandably very frustrated when they write to me and state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I guess its the same old story all over again, the people in outlying communities are the forgotten people.</PARA>
<PARA>Further they state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is a large community, and TV is the only form of enjoyment that a lot of the older people of the community have. With the reception so bad we don't even get a lot of the documentaries or the late news as the screen is so hard to see.</PARA>
<PARA>While the ABC is fulfilling its charter in servicing this area, commercial channels are not. I will be pursuing this matter with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and his department to see what pressure can be brought to bear on these commercial broadcasters in relation to their TV licences so that quality and variety of service will not be something enjoyed just by some people and not by others simply because of where they choose to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Miriam Vale is not the only problem centre in my electorate when it comes to TV and radio services. I also cite the case of Cracow, probably the smallest community in my electorate. Cracow sits out on the boundary of the Maranoa electorate. It has one channel, it has very poor radio reception, and it too would like to have a better quality of life. I think that when we look at the whole area of radio communications the problems do not exist purely in the amateur and CB areas; they extend to other parts of the spectrum and involve allocation of other parts of the spectrum&mdash;or so I am told when I query why these things cannot be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the parliamentary secretary is here. I hope he will take on board the matters I have raised not only with respect to the amateur radio operators who have been so badly treated but also on the broader issue of the spectrum and how it should be delivering a better quality of radio and television reception, both VHF and UHF, to the wide mass of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I think the honourable member is correct. Amateur radio is an educational facility. The amateur radio network has been very useful in many emergencies, such as Cyclone Tracy, Ash Wednesday and the fierce bushfires north of Sydney last year. Radio amateurs have been called on to rig up emergency radio systems and to assist state emergency services until regular channels of communication can be restored. They have done that at their own expense. Amateur radio has been used for scouts and guides in the worldwide jamborees of the air held each October. It keeps exchange students in other countries in touch with their parents. Australian amateur radio operators are among world leaders in the development of new technology and have made very significant contributions to research on satellite technology and in radio propagation studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand fully that the spectrum is a limited natural resource. It is not unlimited: there are borders to it. But there is an international agreement which defines where these borders go. As the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) said in a very worthwhile contribution to the debate, there are 44 blocks of spectrum and 23 bands allocated to amateur radio. Of course, that is worldwide; it is not just for Australia. If I am wrong, I am sure the parliamentary secretary will tell me, but I believe that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there are 44 blocks and 23 bands is irrelevant. The important thing is that for amateur radio there is a strict prohibition on the making of any profit. That is by regulation. Amateur radio is not a commercial use of the spectrum. The regulations state that the service is not to be used for pecuniary interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A tax on usage of the radio spectrum which is already set aside by international convention for amateur radio seems inequitable and unfair. No other country in the world levies such a tax on amateur radio operators. There are fewer than 20,000 licensed radio amateurs in Australia. The Spectrum Management Agency has indicated that CB&mdash;citizens band&mdash;licence fees will be abolished. I can go along with that; I think it is a darn good idea. But why, oh why, are we treating radio amateurs so differently?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Years ago we used to pay radio and television licence fees. The government of the day, in its wisdom, abolished the radio and television licence fees. I applaud that. That was well done. Now we are removing the licence fees for CB operators. I applaud that. As of June 1993, there were 361,546 CB licence holders. They were paying a total of $6,507,828. The government is saying, `We will wipe out 6 1/2 million bucks on CB.' I say that is fine. In 1993 the 18,258 amateur radio licence holders were paying only $639,030. The government is saying it is going to whack that up by 45 per cent. I cannot see the logic, justice, fairness or equity in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question which has to be asked is whether, with the advent of fibre optic and satellite technology, the argument about commercial interests putting on pressure for more spectrum space holds up. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary may be able to comment on that when he sums up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amateur radio operators are a global fraternity. I cannot understand why Australian amateurs are being treated differently from those in the rest of the world. I would like to make a final comment. In his speech on 8 March, the parliamentary secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many apparatus licence users will see fee reductions under this formula, including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, state governments and taxi services . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know what sort of reductions there will be for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. For the life of me, I do not know why the Royal Flying Doctor Service has to pay a licence fee at all&mdash;or why the bush fire brigades and state emergency services should do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I take the opportunity to sum up the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill and related bills that have been debated both today and at a previous sitting. At the outset, I note that the purpose of the legislation is to give apparatus licensees a choice about paying their licence fees up-front or by annual instalment and to introduce a penalty system for the late payment of fees. These amendments are not related to the proposed changes to apparatus licence fees, including fees for amateur radio operators. Nevertheless, obviously this has been part of the focus of debate, not the direct focus, so there are a few points that I should respond to in the limited time available this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms by some speakers in the debate was that there has not been sufficient consultation with amateur operators. That is fundamentally incorrect. As far back as 8 December 1993, the then Minister for Communications directed the Spectrum Management Agency to hold a public inquiry into the apparatus licence system and to advise him of the outcomes. During the inquiry, 14 public seminars were conducted attended by over 900 people. The SMA invited submissions and 422 were received and considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the SMA reported its findings to the minister on 31 May last year there have been ongoing discussions with affected groups including the Wireless Institute of Australia. Changes to apparatus licences, including amateur radio licences, were regularly discussed throughout 1994 at Radio Communications Council meetings in which the Wireless Institute participated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some amateurs have complained that the level of intended fees was not revealed by the SMA until a meeting in December 1994 and that the fees were presented as set with no further possibility for discussion. The SMA always intended to consult again with licensees and even produced the information publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the apparatus licence system</EMPHASIS> in February of this year as the basis for that discussion. So much for the claims about lack of consultation. Clearly, that is not correct. The level of fee now being set is ample evidence of the government's willingness to listen to those community concerns and to respond to the views of amateur radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some speakers in the debate have focused on the international treaty aspects. It is interesting to see the international treaties as the defence used for particular action in this case. One could contrast that with some speakers, including those from the National Party of Australia, on other issues. But I should make a few points in response to that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all&mdash;and the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) referred to this particular question&mdash;Australia has the right to use the radio frequency spectrum in Australia as Australia wishes. The restriction on that use implied by treaty is that, if Australia decides to use a part of the radio frequency spectrum for a purpose different from that provided for in the ITU radio regulations, Australia's treaty obligation is to ensure that no interference is caused to other member countries who are complying with the ITU regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amateurs operate on bands throughout the spectrum. As Australia is a large island and is relatively geographically isolated, it would not be technically difficult for some amateur bands to be used for alternative purposes. Indeed, strong alternative demand does exist in some bands which amateurs currently use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had the comment cast in the debate about the tax element that applies in our proposed $51 fee that the SMA announced earlier in March. The actual tax component proposed in the fee for amateurs has been set at the minimum of $10. The other elements that make up the $51 are not tax arrangements and it is incorrect to refer to them as a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax component for amateurs has been set at the minimum $10, and the total increase in the fee is proposed to go from $37 to $51. Amongst other consultations that occurred, I personally met with the Wireless Institute to discuss these arrangements. We not only discussed the fee; we also discussed what other measures might be appropriate in the future concerns of amateur radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broader question of the spectrum management, I invited the Wireless Institute to come forward with a submission on the most effective means of licensing amateur radio in the longer term. I have recognised that, as have members of the government who have made representations, including strong recommendations from the caucus transport and communications committee chaired by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) on this whole issue. So the suggestion that this is related in some crude way to purely a taxation regime is quite untrue. The fact that we invited the Wireless Institute to make a further submission on the most effective means of licensing amateur radio for the longer term highlights the fact that the SMA is prepared to give full and detailed considerations to those submissions when they are received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the matter was previously before the House, I indicated that there are substantial numbers of winners in this exercise of setting the new regime&mdash;indeed, far more winners than would be perceived losers, and many of those go to the very sorts of services about which most speakers in the debate would be directly concerned. For example, there is the Royal Flying Doctor Service; there is local government in regional and remote areas that operates services of this sort that are indeed a lifeline in many cases will be major beneficiaries; and there are state governments and their range of emergency services. They and other services are, in aggregate, major winners out of this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing these arrangements we have tried to recognise the value of the spectrum at large and the demand and the need to get the most efficient use out of that spectrum. That was the approach going right back to the House of Representatives committee that conducted the inquiry into this process, and it has been followed through in the range of public consultations and inquiries since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a package that is fair and reasonable. Having taken account of the wide range of representations from members, particularly those on behalf of amateur radio operators, the SMA has taken action to reduce the tax component so the fee has now been set at $51. Also in recognition of their determination to address the more effective long-term provisions in these areas, we have invited the Wireless Institute to make a submission on those matters for the longer term as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have actually had letters back from the Wireless Institute saying it welcomes the measures taken and looks forward to putting that submission together. We will certainly be giving detailed consideration to that as the institute completes that exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As most of us would be aware, students around the nation rallied last week, protesting against up-front fees and any more changes to HECS in the upcoming budget. In Whyalla, about 100 students from the University of South Australia held a march. They marched down Nicolson Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares from the university to the Commonwealth offices. I addressed the rally and spoke about the history of HECS and other university fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must congratulate the Whyalla student branch director, Natalie Stevenson, and the campus equity officer, Kathy Turner, for their part in the rally. They did a great job in organising the event and they addressed the students with strong and convincing speeches. They also spoke to the media and did an excellent job of representing student views. I congratulate too the many other Whyalla students who organised the rally and the barbecue which followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I promised students that I would make their views known in the parliament. It is with pride that I do it a matter of three or four days later. The students are angry because the federal government keeps changing the rules on university fees. When Labor introduced HECS in 1988, students protested, but Labor assured Australians that it was payable through the tax system only when students had reached a certain level of income. Since that time, Labor has progressively increased the rate of payment of HECS. Now it wants to charge students before they begin to study and earn the average income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has also attempted to make graduates pay double HECS for a second degree and to financially penalise them for taking longer than the minimum time to complete a degree.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased to be at the rally, to listen to the student speeches and to have the chance to talk to students at the barbecue after the rally. They made the point to me, in a very reasonable, balanced and moderate way, that there is a disincentive to study when you compare unemployment benefits to their access to Austudy. They were very keen to play their part as part of the clever country but what has the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had to say about this?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Last week in Adelaide, the Prime Minister told protesting students to go and get a job. What a remarkable statement! It was almost as though the Prime Minister had entirely forgotten the real world that we are living in. Australia has around a million people unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The unemployment rate in Whyalla, where the student rally took place, has been stable at around 13 per cent for the past couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given government policies, not many people in the upper Spencer Gulf region are surprised at the difficulties young people are having in getting a job. These government policies acknowledge that there are insufficient funds to offer some kind of incentive, some kind of support for the long-term unemployed. The tragedy for this country is the contempt in which the Prime Minister holds those people who are prepared to study and develop their skills. It seems the Prime Minister was advocating that students drop out of university. That short-sighted view is one that cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has not apologised and continues to parade around like some latter day fuehrer. He has shown us who he really is&mdash;someone with a contempt for students who are trying to improve themselves through further education. Perhaps he also has contempt for the unemployed. Maybe the Prime Minister thinks that the unemployment problem has not been caused by the Labor government which, after 13 years, has failed to provide sufficient jobs. Maybe the Prime Minister thinks it is the fault of the unemployed people themselves. His statement about going and getting a job was certainly callous and absurd and I believe students all around Australia will remember it for a long time to come. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If migrants want early citizenship, what right to we have to deny it?</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Blainey seems to have a problem with that. According to the text of his article, he feels that if people come here they should know all about Australia and be able to speak English fluently before they are entitled to citizenship and to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years we have become well used to Professor Blainey's comments. We are also well used to the way in which some people in the community use them. Professor Blainey is well aware of what he is saying and what reactions are provoked. I find it unbelievable that someone in Australia today would carry the sorts of views that Professor Blainey has carried religiously over such a long period, with a complete lack of the logic you would not expect to associate with a professor, even a professor of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Blainey makes the claim that a nation has every right to deny citizenship to those who know nothing about the nation they have just entered. You could apply that to babies, to infants. Following that logic, they could be given permanent residency but not citizenship. Certainly, the right to vote would be something even further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who come here and take citizenship at a later age come here through a difficult process. In fact, some of them come here from some of the greatest hell holes on earth. Eventually, they achieve permanent residency. They pay their taxes, most of them work very hard, and they contribute to the economy. One only has to look at the way in which their children&mdash;and often the migrants themselves&mdash;get involved in higher education, and the way in which they go on from there to contribute to the benefit of Australia. Yet Professor Blainey would have it that, because they cannot speak English, even though they pay taxes, they should not have a say in how this country operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Professor Blainey is extending his elitist mentality in a way that does this country no good whatsoever. By his definition, the way in which this country gives citizenship to people who cannot speak English effectively reduces citizenship and all it entails to a level attainable by monkeys. That is incredibly obscene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He makes the point that English is the language of parliament, and so it is, but there are many other ways by which people speaking other languages receive information&mdash;radio, TV, newspapers or word of mouth. If the criterion for voting were people's understanding of the political system and what is going on in Australia, it would be difficult to say who was eligible to vote. To suggest that people can only understand what is going on in this country through an understanding of English is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Blainey really wants to limit a person's access to the vote. This is part of a campaign by Blainey and others to draw attention to one of the greatest strengths in our democracy&mdash;our voting system. Who makes the decision about who can vote? Obviously, Professor Blainey is trying to make one. As he says, the keystone to democracy is that every voter has to accept responsibility for the nation's wellbeing. That is a fact. Our system of compulsory voting enforces that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

There the sitting member, John Turner, is starting off on a very high base of about 17.7 per cent on a two-party preferred basis.

I rise tonight to pursue this matter, which gives me no pleasure at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 September 1994 his daughter, then aged 17 going on 18, was apprehended on a charge of stealing as a servant. She admitted many cases, totalling about $715, but she was caught on that occasion with $100. She was charged with just one offence and was taken down to the police station. Mr McKechnie attended. The charge was reduced to a caution. Stealing as a servant is an indictable offence and, to say the least, she is extremely lucky that it was reduced to a caution. The next day his wife was down there with cakes for the police. The constable who had actually done the paperwork&mdash;whose name I have here&mdash;received a call from Internal Affairs saying that the police had done a good job but to forget all about it.

When I found out about it, I agonised over what I should do. Clearly, it could have been very embarrassing for me, but in my son's interest I had to make him take the glasses back and confront the chemist, not knowing whether the chemist would lay charges. As it turned out, the chemist decided he would not do anything about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here some confidential documents that have fallen into my hands. Following my last speech in parliament I had a debate on radio with the assistant commissioner in Perth, following which I have been inundated with material from people who have suffered grave injustices at the hands of Mr Ayton and Mr McKechnie. These documents refer to the Burke trial when certain substantial documents went missing. I am on the record as saying that Brian Burke was not convicted on the evidence; there was no evidence to convict him at all. Had he been tried in Queensland, he certainly would have been acquitted. He was convicted on the emotion stirred up by the newspaper and by judicious leaks from the chief prosecutor, Mr McKechnie, who has his own ideas of justice. </PARA>

Of the 10 male members standing again at the next election, two of them are under 40, seven of them are aged from 40 to 47 and only one is over 50, namely, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is aged 52&mdash;hardly retiring age. One could predict that he might even feel like keeping going when he gets into his late 50s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to years of election, the longest serving&mdash;since 1983&mdash;are the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and, again, the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Three were elected in 1987&mdash;they have been here for a relatively short length of time. One of these Labor male members from Queensland came in 1988 in a by-election, two came in 1990 and two came in 1993. So they are the 10 male members who are standing again. The longest that any one of them has been here is 12 years. That is hardly a long period of time in parliament. In fact, the majority of them have been here for only a very brief time indeed. I would say that none of them have any intention of standing down before the year 2002. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The New South Wales election has been a distraction for many in terms of what has happened in this place. Being a member from New South Wales, I feel there is a need to draw some attention to that distraction. I would like to congratulate the voters of New South Wales who have elected a Labor government. I would like to do that for a number of reasons. I come from a town called Kiama. In terms of hospitals, our hospital was closed by the Liberals. It is going to be re-opened. Bob Carr is going to attend to waiting lists in New South Wales. He will not have to build new hospitals; he will just have to open the existing beds which are available within the existing structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to education, as I was a teacher, I watched the teaching staff in schools being ripped out of those institutions. We will now see a re-institution of the numbers needed to keep class sizes down to such a level that the children in New South Wales will have the same opportunities as those in other states. In fact, hopefully, they will have a better opportunity. Bob Carr has made a pledge with regard to education. He has shown it to be one of the core areas of concern throughout his whole political career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Roads will be dramatically affected in terms of the outcome of this election. The priorities of the former Liberal coalition government were basically about looking after cronies and mates, so that we had beautiful highways in the National Party seats out west, but in areas such as mine, which have had Labor or Independent members, there has been no level of funding commensurate with the needs of those areas. The Labor government that is coming in under Bob Carr is committed to prioritising regional economic roads. That means that main road 92 and the Princes Highway, the great bottleneck every Sunday which has dramatic effects on the South Coast, will be attended to because there is an economic precedent. And it is not just a case of catering for your mates. Therefore, the new order and the new honesty that Bob Carr will bring to New South Wales politics will be very refreshing in terms of the distribution of road funds in New South Wales. In terms of rail, electrification will finally come down the South Coast line&mdash;a promise by the Liberals for the last eight years which they have not done a thing about. Now it will become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of police numbers, much was said about the law and order debate in New South Wales. It was not so much about what the courts should do or about more severe sentences. That was a distraction. The real issue was about having police numbers on the streets. In New South Wales we had advertisements telling us we had police on beats. But that is all it was&mdash;advertisements. The only policeman who was on a beat was the bloke behind the camera. We need police numbers to be increased in the villages and townships of my electorate. Bob Carr has promised to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Carr made a significant announcement during the election which really went unheeded. He said there would be no new ocean outfalls. For anyone with an environmental conscience, for anyone with a knowledge of what happens around our coastal areas, that one statement should have been enough to bring him across the line&mdash;no new ocean sewage outfalls. I applaud Bob Carr for that and for his commitment to the environment. He said more than that. He said that the water from those sewage management systems would have to be diverted inland and reused. He also put the prospect&mdash;one that is close to my heart&mdash;of forest plantations rising from that so that there would be new wealth, so that we can take the heat out of the war which has raged on the South Coast of New South Wales. His commitment to and his support for his forestry plan means that we will go forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own seat, my work in tourism has been with the RTA bike ride which has been a magnificent success. Sadly, ICM at Berrima has done the most callous thing in terms of pulling apart one of Australia's best abattoirs. We were trying to put together with Wingecarribee council and other concerned people a bid which would save that industry and 180 jobs in our area. Unfortunately, through ICM's belligerence, that is not to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to working with the New South Wales government in my area and improving the services and commitment to the people which have been a hallmark of the Labor Party, Labor Party representation and Labor Party governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I have asked my Department to obtain a copy of the World Watch Institute report and provide appropriate briefing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The situation with fish stocks managed by the Commonwealth is outlined in the publication `Fishery Status Reports 1993&mdash;Resource Assessments of Australian Commonwealth Fisheries' by the Bureau of Resource Sciences. This report classified six Commonwealth fisheries as under exploited, 11 as fully fished and only 4 overfished, with 10 uncertain or unknown. The overfished stocks are southern bluefin tuna, eastern gemfish, school shark and redfish.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Demand for seafood is rising worldwide as a result of the gradual removal of barriers to trade, population increases, demographic and health factors and rising incomes, especially in the industrialising Asian nations.

This compares to the numbers of chicks fledged in the previous 4 years which ranged from 1160 to 1741. The deaths are apparently due to a localised, natural fluctuation in the availability of krill, their major food source.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. A case-by-case assessment is made before deciding whether to remove or deport non-Australian citizens convicted of criminal offences after they have served their sentences in Australia. Relevant factors include the seriousness of the crime, the length of time sentenced for the crime, the possibility of recidivism, the contribution the person has made to the community, the length of lawful residence in Australia and the degree of hardship that would be caused to Australian residents and citizens known to be adversely affected by the deportation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Act 1958 (the Act) provides for the deportation of permanent residents who, in their first ten years of residence, commit an offence which results in a sentence of imprisonment for at least one year. Deportation is not mandatory in these circumstances, but is a matter for the exercise of the personal discretion of the Minister, or his or her delegate. The circumstances under which deportation decisions are made are set out in the Ministerial Statement to the Parliament on Australia's Criminal Deportation Policy, effective from 24 December 1992. If an Australian permanent resident has been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than one year, there is no provision under the Act to deport that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act also provides for the power to cancel visas on character grounds. The Minister may decide that a person is not of good character on the basis of his/her past criminal conduct or general conduct, or their association with another person, group or organisation reasonably believed to be involved in criminal conduct. Upon cancellation of their visa, the person would become an unlawful non-citizen and be liable to detention and removal from Australia.</PARA>
