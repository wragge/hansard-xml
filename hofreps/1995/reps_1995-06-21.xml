<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable? The migration agents registration scheme</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report on the migration agents registration scheme fundamentally derives from a compromise in an area where there are differing views on this scheme. It is fair to say that there is a unanimous view that there have been and continue to be problems in the industry, whether it be the question of unscrupulous operators who exploit an extremely vulnerable group in our community, those who in many cases have minimal chances of succeeding in claims for permanent residence in the country, or whether it be that both the lawyers and non-lawyers, as far as this community is concerned, in this field really lack expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is agreed that there is a need for some controls in this field. The long-term debate is whether it be by government instituted regulation or by a degree of self-regulation. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) asked for consideration after a period of two years of this scheme. The committee had differing views as to the success and the possible future operation of the scheme. The committee has decided unanimously that the scheme should operate for another three years and that it should be reviewed by the same committee at that stage but that, in the interim, objective performance indicators should be developed by the board itself. That is the stage we have reached today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any doubt, as I said earlier, that the industry has problems. I fairly consistently see agents out there&mdash;you really have to have doubts about their presence in the field&mdash;and, on a personal level, I have had to refer at least one complaint to the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that some of the problems in the industry and the operation of this board derive from the fact that it has been, perhaps understandably, preoccupied in the last two years with the registration process. There has been minimal disciplinary action at this stage. But, on the other hand, it is fair to say that the fact that 600 people have either been denied entry or registration or have on their own part decided not to proceed is an indication that something is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee came to the conclusion that lawyers in the field should still be registered. That position has been upheld by the High Court. At the same time, the High Court did say that there were aspects of the industry and the practice of lawyers that should not come within the province of the registration board. Therefore, it has been suggested that a lawyer be exempt from the requirement to register as a migration agent when undertaking preparation or representation in relation to visa refusals or cancellation before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee is concerned that the current processes do not catch up with advice in some fields. Therefore, it is suggested that with regard to advice the legislation cover family members and sponsors in future. There is a major recommendation on the issue of the current different schedule fees. It was thought that, since the inauguration of the measures, too many people were being permitted to take the concessionary fee. Therefore, new provisions have been recommended to overcome those concerns. The committee has recommended that registered agents who live in towns and regions where there is no access to alternative immigration assistance and who provide immigration assistance in less than six cases per year should pay the concessional levy of $100 for agents registering in their own right and $50 for agents registering as employees of registered agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schedule should be modified not to police a system that does a minimal number of cases each year, particularly in areas where there is no alternative, but to make sure that the whole thing is not exploited widely and that a large number of people are paying minimal fees. People who do not have expertise perhaps have to be encouraged to actually continue to be part of the industry. That is a fairly important modification. To give some indication of the growth of the application of concessional fees, in June 1994 39 per cent of agents were paying that fee. This obviously applies to a wider group than was originally intended by the minister or the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains 49 recommendations from the committee. The committee is of the view that the very close relationship that currently exists between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Migration Agents Registration Board should be lessened, and that the role of the chairman should not attach itself to the department. But, at the same time, the committee saw a need for the department to have a representative on the board. The committee has suggested that there be more liberal arrangements for constituting a quorum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important and unanimous recommendation from the committee&mdash;No. 34&mdash;was that the code of conduct for migration agents be amended to provide that a migration agent should not lodge vexatious or grossly unfounded applications. That is a typical aspect of the industry which we are all aware of. In this country the ability to pursue legal claims is very liberal. That can be fairly scandalously exploited by some practitioners who receive a substantial amount of money. As a consequence, people are running through our system for years on end without much hope of a claim and, through that process, slowing down the claims of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was agreed to unanimously. It represents the views of a group of people who have a reasonable knowledge of this field. The people have had a long-term involvement in the field and are aware of the problems out there. The recommendations do represent a reasonable compromise. We will be able to see how this system pans out in the next three years. There will be the opportunity to push for greater training in the private sector and the opportunity to liberalise requirements for community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat and advisers. I have been involved with many committees, but the swiftness with which this report has been compiled and the work that has gone into it, considering the legal problems in the field and the need for international comparisons, has been very worth while. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I draw attention to the cover of the report. It is rather remarkable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS> is the title. You would think there was a message in that that what we were about was protecting the vulnerable. But the title has at the end of it a question mark. That question mark after the title was very deliberate because, while we all want to protect the vulnerable, the outcome of this inquiry shows that there is no clear evidence that in trying to achieve that objective that outcome has been derived. It is a matter of very real concern to me and my colleagues who participated in this inquiry that there was an inability to come to a concluded view about whether or not this registration scheme had achieved its objective of protecting those in Australia who are seeking to remain here and those who want to bring relatives to Australia and are seeking advice to assist those who are very often vulnerable to exploitation by the activities of those who are often seen to be somewhat parasitical in their approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that we have set up quite an expensive registration scheme. We did so after the government had gone through a number of changes of attitude about this matter. We had in place over a long period of time a registration scheme, but it did not work. When Senator Ray was minister for immigration he determined that we would put in place another system which relied more upon consumer affairs principles. When Mr Hand was minister for immigration we developed this comprehensive registration system. We did so in the context of the changes that have been occurring in administrative law in Australia whereby people who are registering and are likely to be struck off have certain entitlements to the administration and judicial review of any decisions taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have set in place administrative arrangements about which we have a great deal of information. We can tell you how many people have registered, how many people have been refused registration, a good deal about the amount of revenue that has been derived and something about the qualifications of the people who have registered. There is a good deal of information on profile. In terms of any statistical analysis of performance which would enable us to evaluate whether or not the scheme has been successful, there is a dearth of information. When we got down to analysing whether or not the scheme ought to be maintained, all we had was a whole lot of anecdotal information from people in the field. Many of the people in the field who can offer advice are highly qualified to give expert opinions that you could rely on. When you look at the nature of their advice, you find that they came down on both sides of the ledger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read out some advice from the Springvale Community Aid and Advice Bureau. The lady from the bureau who gave evidence was Merle Mitchell. She is very well known for her expertise in these fields of the social sciences. The bureau had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The migration agents registration scheme has given extra status to those who are registered and has made it easier for them to attract clients and dramatically increase charges. People believe that those who are registered must have the expertise which is required for a successful application. In fact, there are no checks and balances once registered. Those who are registered do not come under any scrutiny unless complained against. In fact, the quality of the service provided has not improved. We have many examples of inaccurate and inadequate information, poorly prepared submissions and inappropriate representation.</PARA>
<PARA>If there is to be any review of this scheme in the future, people will have to come to grips with putting in place the collection of statistical information that will enable them to come to proper conclusions about the validity of the scheme. That is the message contained in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We deal with a lot of other issues in relation to trying to improve the registration scheme and trying to deal with some of the technical problems that have arisen. My colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has covered most of them. We unanimously support that, but there is this concern that we have gone down the regulatory route&mdash;that is fine&mdash;but, if the regulatory route does not achieve the outcome expected of it, should we keep in place a complex, expensive administrative scheme if it is not going to deliver the goods? That is really the question that needs to be addressed. This report cannot, because the evidence is not available, give us the answer but it does give us a pointer as to what needs to be done in the future to collect the information that will enable valid conclusions to be drawn and for a judgment to be made as to whether or not we still need to have this sort of registration scheme in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleague, I thank the professional staff of the committee. I thank its secretary, Andres Lomp; his research officer, Stephen Boyd; and those who worked with the secretariat. I particularly thank the person who gave the committee over a long period legal advice, Dr Kathryn Cronin. I think we were particularly lucky to have had available to the committee the service of somebody of that competence, background and experience. She is a highly qualified academic who gives of her time. I guess there is a fee, but we were extraordinarily lucky to have had her undertaking that work, particularly given her overseas experience in the immigration area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank Mr Ian Branston, who was seconded from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He had the background in relation to this report. He did not influence the conclusions we came to but he certainly knew the procedures and what had been done and was able to provide invaluable support and advice on the inner workings of the scheme and the department. I commend the report to all those who are interested in reading it. It demonstrates the value of the parliamentary committee system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The fact that it is necessary to have a migration agents registration scheme, to my mind, is a reflection, first, on the complexity of laws affecting migrants in this country and, secondly, on the capacity and the willingness of members of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide what I see as the public face so essential in a civil service to provide advice without fee and without question of a person's integrity. It has long been my concern that in so many ways the federal Public Service extends over an enormous range of disciplines with a large number of individuals, some of whom certainly have a capacity to provide a kind, sympathetic and helpful reaction to public inquiries but too many regretfully the reverse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many aspects in that part which deal with the frequency with which people are moved. I do not think enough emphasis is given to the status of the people who have desk interface with the inquiring public. I commend to senior officers in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the practice that Trevor Boucher, the former Commissioner of Taxation, adopted in the Australian Taxation Office: from time to time he and other senior officers went on exercises to meet the public at the front counter to see the nature and extent of inquiries that are pursued with the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doing that would not mean we would be able to overcome all the obligations that migration agents now fulfil, but I believe there is a singular ineffectiveness in too many people providing help at the public interface within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. On too many occasions I find people come to me and to my electorate office simply because the department has not been as helpful as I wish it could be at that public interface. By the time we get to a more senior officer of course help can be provided, but too often members of the public do not know how or in what way they can find that more senior officer. As a result, we have the extraordinarily complex scheme which this report embraces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to add only briefly to the comments made by previous speakers. As my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who spoke before me in this debate, identified, there is a question mark at the end of the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS> The people about whom this report is really concerned are those who quite often have little knowledge of the English language. If they have the language, they do not have the understanding of the depth of the innuendo and inference of English. As a result, quite often they do need to be treated in a slightly different way from those who are totally familiar with our language and our culture. Too often those who are essentially seeking help in the refugee migration field have also suffered in the countries from which they came, hence their search to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people with whom migration agents deal are vulnerable. There is no doubt that the code of conduct&mdash;and there are some remarks in the report about the code of conduct for migration agents&mdash;is designed to ensure the migration agents themselves do not exploit those vulnerable people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it is true that no final decision has been reached on the validity of this whole process. The first of the committee's recommendations is that the scheme be continued to operate for a further three years with a range of improvements, and they are detailed. But it also recommends that before the end of those three years there be another inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the migration agents scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations that were made in this report have identified a number of improvements. It is imperative that there be a capacity through the Migration Agents Registration Board to supervise the functioning by migration agents of the tasks for which they are paid. There is a question of costs and the extent to which some seem to charge more than others, and that is always a matter for people providing professional advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence tendered to the committee was mixed. The quality of the migration agents themselves also seemed to be mixed. I confess to having come away from the inquiry with doubts in my own mind as to the efficacy of migration agents as they are now structured. In too many instances, a report or the conduct of a particular inquiry is based more on the knowledge that a particular migration agent has particular officers within the department than it is on any particular technical competence they have in their own field. I was pleased that in the report we have included a reference to the form by which future training is essential for migration agents before they are registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to echo my colleagues' commendation of the staff of the committee&mdash;that is, Andres Lomp and Stephen Boyd. I would also echo the sentiments of my committee colleagues in stating that we are extraordinarily fortunate to have the services of Dr Kathryn Cronin. She has been remarkable in the work she has done for the committee. It is a very good example of how the academic interface can be of assistance in a field as technical as this. The committee is indebted to Ian Branston too, who was seconded from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, for his work was very helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report. I also recommend to the government that it take note of that other recommendation that there be a further inquiry into the migration agents registration scheme before the termination of the three years extension, which this committee also recommends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to assist in modernising the law on personal insolvency. Key provisions of the bill include simplified processes for low income minor bankruptcies, the creation of a one-stop bankruptcy shop and the tightening of the provisions dealing with those who divest themselves of property to third parties when facing bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of 1993 the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) released three discussion papers on the reform of the Bankruptcy Act. These papers dealt with the property available for payment of debts, the administration of the states and the reform of part X of the act. They arose out of the Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry. Some of the amendments to this legislation result from those papers and some are designed to improve the drafting of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill covers five major areas. The first is the administration of bankruptcy matters. When an individual becomes bankrupt his or her property and finances are placed into the hands of a trustee in bankruptcy. Usually, the trustee is an accountant or lawyer registered under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Where a registered trustee is unavailable, the responsibility always falls to the official trustee. Official receivers act on behalf of the official trustee, usually on a state basis. The administration and oversight of bankruptcy matters is carried out by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first step in a bankruptcy process is the issue of a notice on the debtor either on the application of creditors or by the debtors own petition. Bankruptcy notices are issued by registrars in bankruptcy who are based in the Federal Court. In each state and territory, the registrar is the district registrar of the Federal Court. The property of the debtor then comes under the control of the trustee in bankruptcy. There is some interaction and overlap between the ITSA and the registrars in bankruptcies in formal record keeping and documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will provide that the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy, apart from the residual jurisdiction of the High Court. The administrative day to day record keeping and documentation procedures will be handled by one agency. The bill proposes a concept of a one-stop shop with the transfer of certain administrative functions from the Federal Court to the ITSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office of the registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy will be abolished and their duties transferred to the official receiver. This will allow an ordinary debtor who files for bankruptcy to deal with the ITSA alone and to have more prompt service from one Commonwealth agency. This will avoid the present exchange of the documentation between the Federal Court and the ITSA and will reduce the cost involved in duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While having one agency to handle bankruptcy matters will be less costly than the current process, the recent High Court decision in the Brandy case raises a number of concerns. While the High Court indicated that it is often difficult to separate judicial and administrative functions, apart from the issue of enforceability which is clearly an exercise in judicial power, it is worth commenting that this is a matter which may only be resolved by litigation. The Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia is concerned at the consolidation of power into the hands of the ITSA. The amendments will further concentrate that power. Serious concerns about the ITSA have been raised by practitioners. They have indicated that they think the ITSA is under-performing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reform addressed by this bill relates to property and other transactions prior to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is said to commence on the occasion of the first act of bankruptcy within six months before the actual date of presentation of the petition. This means that certain transactions are rendered void against a claim by the trustee. In certain circumstances some property settlements, dating back as far as five years, can be challenged by the trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law currently looks at the intention to parties and the nature of the settlements. The bill will change the test for determining whether these prior settlements are immune from claims. The simpler test under the bill will mean that if the bankrupt transferred property to another person for no consideration or for less than the market value those transactions may be subject to a claim by the trustee. The test will be one of whether at the time of the transfer of the property the now bankrupt was `technically insolvent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will place the emphasis on the likely effect on creditors of that earlier transaction. This will attempt to overcome a rort, which will enable the debtor to transfer property to escape a personal guarantee and to then declare bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `technically insolvent' raises a number of concerns as it catches potential liabilities. This definition could technically catch individuals who, under the principle of joint and several liability, are called upon to provide for the entire sum of a guarantee. While the guarantors may have the funds to provide for their expected part of the amount, they may be unable to provide for the entire guarantee and may therefore come under the definition of technically insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All groups consulted by the opposition have concerns with the wording of these provisions, particularly that they will apply to all bankruptcies that are current when the provisions are finally enacted, amounting to retrospective legislation. These provisions should apply only to the transactions which take place after the new sections commence operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area relates to insolvency administrations outside actual bankruptcy. Under the Bankruptcy Act, a person who is facing a serious financial crisis may enter into a part X arrangement, which is a step short of actual bankruptcy, such as an agreement for a schedule of payment by instalments. The bill amends these procedures to make the procedure the same for both solicitors and trustees who act for debtors who enter into assignments, arrangements or compositions under part X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also introduce a new form of debt administration, which will be known as a part IX debt agreement, which will apply to debtors whose level of liability does not exceed $20,000. This will provide for the circulation of a debtor's proposal for payment of less than the full amount or for periodic payments. This new part is an attempt to simplify proceedings for a debtor where the debtor owes a smaller amount, as can be done with the additional requirements for a part X arrangement, such as the necessity to call a meeting, and is done through the official trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are concerns on this side of the House that the legislation will further consolidate the power of the ITSA by casting it in the role as regulator and adviser. Debtors may not get the most objective, best advice and may not seek their own independent advice from a third party but accept the advice of ITSA. We feel the amount of $20,000 may be too low and it may be more appropriate to have a higher amount such as $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of reform addressed by the bill is the income contributions from bankrupts. These amendments are in response to the decision of the Federal Court in the case of Bond v. Ramsay of 1994. In this case, the trustee classified the provision of over $700,000 in housing, office expenses, travel and telephone and legal expenses by Mr Bond's family and associates as fringe benefits and, therefore, income related, attracting the income contribution provisions of the act. Mr Bond was therefore required to make a substantial income contribution to reduce his debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bond challenged this assessment and was successful on appeal to the Federal Court, and the $700,000 was considered to be gifts and not income. While the trustee is appealing this decision in the High Court, the bill attempts to restore what was intended in the original amendments in 1992 dealing with income contribution from bankrupts and will now also cover loans and other benefits to bankrupts. Again, the coalition has some concerns about these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key provision is to amend the definition of income in section 139L, which will include the value of a benefit that is provided in any circumstances and the value of the loan made to a bankrupt. This means that a bankrupt who receives payment of legal fees to challenge a decision of the trustee may be required to make an income contribution on the basis that legal aid would fall within the income definition. The trustee, while having a discretion to exclude certain payments from the income contribution provisions, in reality may rarely exercise this discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council has raised a contrasting concern, indicating that the proposed amendment may not work as, although it attempts to remove the requirement for a benefit to be provided in respect of employment, it may still require an employment nexus, relying as it does on the definition of benefit within the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern about the way the income provision has been drafted in that any provision of the FBTAA can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. We feel that is an inappropriate delegation of legislative power and may be open to constitutional challenge. The Law Council has also indicated that these new sections should not apply to transactions which took place before the commencement of the new provisions, as such retrospective operation would be quite unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth area of reform is to the duties of the trustees. New duties will be introduced which will require a more commercial orientation of trustees. The trustee will be required to report to creditors within three months on the specific issue of whether creditors can expect a dividend and also to administer estates with a view to avoid unnecessary expense. The official trustee will become the sole registering authority for the trustees. The opposition does not consider this to be controversial. Additional comments have been expressed by professional bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern has been expressed by the Law Council and the IPAA that no attempt has been made in the bill to achieve consistency with the relevant provisions of the Corporations Law. A number of practitioners have mentioned the lack of the level playing field between the official trustee and registered trustees. The IPAA believes there needs to be a level playing field between the two. While the official trustee is subsidised, private trustees are not. The bill will allow official trustees to accept appointments under part X of the act, but private trustees will not be allowed to accept appointments in relation to new debt agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of financial impact. The one-stop service will, according to the government, involve the expenditure of $1.04 million in 1994-95, reducing to $125,000 in 1997-98. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) acknowledges in the second reading speech to this bill that bankruptcy laws have been unnecessarily complicated. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of this important bill it is opportune to address briefly some of the recent ill-informed criticism of the effectiveness of bankruptcy law.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister felt that criticism of this law was harsh and the parliamentary secretary quoted in his speech particular examples of people going bankrupt for a variety of reasons beyond their control. Going bankrupt for some people is beyond their control. I think it is a direct function of economic policy in many circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal concern with this bill is that there has been very little consultation with the victims of bankruptcy. The minister acknowledges that business is about taking risks and making profits. Taking risks also means making losses. Government gets involved in regulating small business in many ways: it collects taxes; it regulates business activities to ensure that a set of rules apply that have the effect of law, and the business has to operate within these rules. We also see the government legislating for workers rights, but you cannot legislate for honesty and you cannot make ethics compulsory. So it is necessary for legislation such as this to protect the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that bankruptcy is a matter which has been of major concern to me for the last five years, since I have been in parliament. The engine room of growth in my electorate is the building industry. The ups and downs of the economy are mostly reflected in the building industry. It is interesting to have a look at bankruptcy statistics. They tell a story. It can be said that they are directly a function of the state of the economy. The most recent figures show that the number of bankruptcies in the southern states is declining. As the economies of Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales pick up, the number of bankruptcies as a percentage changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing 1993-94 figures to 1992-93 as a percentage of change, New South Wales has fallen 6.8 per cent, the ACT has fallen 8.8 per cent, Victoria has fallen 5.8 per cent, South Australia has fallen 4.8 per cent, but Queensland has risen by 1.2 per cent. Queensland missed out on the harshness of the recession that the southern states suffered because we had continual growth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make my first speech from this position in the chamber, which is a little more distant from my last spot. I rise, with a great deal of pleasure, to speak on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill and to comment on certain aspects of the recent history of bankruptcy and financial dealings of some of the most notable of our so-called entrepreneurs that have given rise to some of these amendments. I am sure the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, would concede, that there were some quite remarkable loopholes in the legislation. Not the least, of course, was the loophole in relation to the question of income which Mr Bond explored and which in the Federal Court he succeeded in keeping open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would make a couple of comments. First of all, I congratulate the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), who has been elevated by election in the caucus to the dizzy heights of the deputy prime ministership of the country. As a fellow Western Australian, I congratulate him for achieving that office. This, I suppose, in a way reflects the sorts of circumstances that have given rise to these legislative amendments. I suggest that it would be pertinent, or perhaps advantageous, for the new Deputy Prime Minister at some stage in the near future to make a statement to the House on some of the aspects of the WA Inc. years and the involvement of the state Labor Party. Some of the people who have more latterly fallen into disrepute would have been colleagues and associates within the state government. There are aspects of the Western Australian Labor Party state executive's involvement in decision making that may have related to WA Inc. and other ancillary matters relating to some of the advantageous decisions that were made by the Western Australian Labor governments of Mr Burke, Mr Dowding and, more latterly, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), that gave some of these `entrepreneurs' such wonderful deals at the taxpayers' expense. Quite clearly, even though the honourable member has risen now to that particular status, there are still a number of us who would like to see clarified the role and the involvement of prominent members of the Labor Party, of the Labor government and also&mdash;in particular and more importantly in relation to this chamber&mdash;the federal Labor government in those years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, I know of, and have commended you in the past for, the tremendous amount of work you have done on highly technical legislation relating to financial dealings of individuals and corporations. I commend you for that extraordinary amount of work you have done over the years&mdash;something I believe that your constituents would be very pleased with. I am sure that they would reflect, and would probably agree with me, that your contribution to this chamber over the years has been excellent. I am sure that it will continue in the future&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that you have been so savagely disendorsed by the Crichton-Browne faction in the Western Australian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would well know, in recent years and, more importantly, in recent times, I suppose within a question of months, the minds of many people around the country have been focused very strongly on the extraordinary&mdash;almost miraculous&mdash;events surrounding the financial dealings most notably of the failed entrepreneur, Mr Bond, and, in the case of Queensland, the failed now expatriate entrepreneur, Mr Skase. Let us have a quick look at what has really occurred. If we look carefully, both Mr Bond and Mr Skase&mdash;although in particular I am concentrating on the Bond end of this particular argument&mdash;received, I suppose, favourable arrangements and became wealthier and more active and closer, particularly in the case of Mr Bond, to both the state Labor government of Western Australia and the federal Labor government when, as far as the economy was concerned, there were better times. At that time, we saw extraordinary deals both in Western Australia and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All through this period&mdash;from 1983 to the present&mdash;Labor has been in office federally. One has to ask oneself why these changes have taken so long. I am not reflecting on the current minister, because he has been the minister for only a relatively short time. Why has it taken so long for the federal Labor government, which under the constitution has a responsibility to administer the bankruptcy laws, to tighten up something that many people have seen as being a significant problem for a very long time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cynical in the community might say that it has more to do with the extraordinary largess&mdash;the gifts or donations&mdash;donated by some of these entrepreneurs, not the least of whom was Mr Bond himself, to the Labor Party during the 1980s. Others might say that it had more to do with the fact that there seemed to be a close mateship between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, Mr Bond and others. This mateship has been speculated upon in the media and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would all recall in the early days of the Western Australian government that very famous posed group photo of the Sir John Curtin Foundation in Western Australia, which included the then Prime Minister, Mr Bond and others of the entrepreneurial set of the 1980s. I think that photo, more than any photo of the time, represents in an illustrative way the close bond between those entrepreneurs, the state Labor Party and the federal Labor government. The most notable inclusion in that photograph was the Prime Minister at the time, the Hon. Bob Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why people's minds have become focused on these issues is that, in many cases, they have seen the laws as being so obviously deficient. In the case of Mr Bond, we saw him apparently leading a luxurious lifestyle, because he was driven away from the courts in a Rolls Royce and he was able to conduct deals while he was still a bankrupt. On television and in the popular media, his affairs have become a source of constant speculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Mr Skase, he was fortunate enough to escape the clutches of Australian law. We had the ridiculous situation where the Spanish courts allowed him to stay in Spain and quite clearly escape the likely retribution of Australian law should he have been returned to Australia. </PARA>

He is a man who quite clearly appeared to be very sick&mdash;and claimed to be very sick&mdash;but who was able to achieve a remarkable recovery after the Spanish courts made their momentous decision to allow him to remain in Spain and escape the warrants that had been issued to extradite him to Australia to face the Australian courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that, even though some may argue that this is a complaint on the part of the creditors of Mr Bond and Mr Skase, it involves the financial arrangements and touches the lives of other people in the community. It is important to reflect that these days there is a greater sense of closeness&mdash;in other words, these types of arrangements percolate through the entire community. In the 1980s when the foreign debt started to burgeon under the federal Labor government, it used to be the popular myth&mdash;it is not anymore&mdash;that this was not public debt or somehow the result of the federal Labor government's policies: this was private debt. Therefore, strictly speaking, it had nothing to do with the administration of the economy: it merely affected the private financial arrangements of people who had indebted themselves to overseas creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this type of arrangement and the sorts of results that have occurred in more recent times when Mr Bond and Mr Skase have escaped the closer scrutiny of the bankruptcy laws have a percolating effect all the way through the community. With the advent of compulsory superannuation schemes and the like, most people&mdash;very few people avoid this&mdash;tend to be shareholders or have some financial connection to the losses that are incurred. As a consequence, they suffer a loss, however minuscule that might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can reflect back to the 1980s when the debate over foreign debt started&mdash;we saw foreign debt escalate from $36 billion under the last coalition government to $166 billion under this government&mdash;and in particular reflect on that debate as it related to private and public debt. Back in those times, funnily enough, I used to use the analogy of Mr Bond's own situation to illustrate to people who raised the argument how you could separate private and public debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analogy I used to use, which was particularly pertinent to Western Australians, was that every time consumers purchased a can or a bottle of Swan Lager they were contributing to the servicing of Mr Bond's overseas debts. So even though one could argue that a private debt was something that was a matter for a private individual or corporation and therefore unconnected to public debt or the administration of the economy, the effect of the debt and its servicing is passed on to consumers and passed on throughout the community&mdash;there is a percolating effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The point is that this situation has been going on for a long time. The bankruptcy laws have been seen as being deficient for a very long time. It has taken the federal Labor government in the region of 12 years to resolve the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am merely speculating why it has taken so long for these matters to be ironed out. Are we merely shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted? We are in fact seeing the law being tightened now because everybody who was associated with Labor governments back in the 1980s has virtually escaped the clutches of the law, although I must add that some other cases concerning Mr Bond and others associated with the state Labor government in the 1980s are still in process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to reflect on the principal matter raised in the Bond v. Ramsay case in the Federal Court, and that is permissible income. It is important to note that Mr Bond is now no longer a bankrupt, although Mr Ramsay in recent articles has raised the possible resurrection of that bankruptcy if it can be shown that Mr Bond failed to disclose assets that he may have held overseas&mdash;I see the minister nodding to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the income contribution scheme, to which this matter is pertinent, was introduced into the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in 1992&mdash;in actual fact, another piece of legislation passed virtually after the horse has bolted&mdash;and commenced operation on 1 July 1992. Basically, the scheme provides that a bankrupt who, through expertise, professional calling or fringe benefits, is able to continue to receive a comparatively high income and lifestyle while technically bankrupt should contribute some of that excess income to his or her creditors. That is an admirable sort of principle, but it failed miserably through the rigour which was applied to it in the case of Bond v. Ramsay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A formula was applied which established a permissible income threshold, based on 3 1/2 times the basic pension with some increase for dependants or child support, and the amount of excess income above that threshold is divided by two with one half going to creditors via the trustee. As a rule of thumb, once a bankrupt started earning in excess of $24,400 per annum he or she was liable to make an income contribution of half of the amount above $24,400. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Bond v. Ramsay, the trustee, Mr Ramsay, classified the provision of over $700,000 in terms of housing, office expenses, travel, telephone and legal expenses to Mr Bond by family and associates of Mr Bond as fringe benefits and, therefore, income related. An assessment was made by Mr Ramsay of a substantial income contribution to be made by Mr Bond. But, on appeal to the Federal Court, a majority two to one decision found in favour of Mr Bond and the $700,000 worth of payments were held to be gifts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the fact that in 1994 the Minister for Justice announced in a media release that the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy had approved financial assistance for an application by the trustee for special leave to appeal to the High Court. As we all know now with the benefit of hindsight, the decision by the creditors to accept Mr Bond's offer made that irrelevant. But essentially the issue is whether the definition of `income' in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 is adequate to catch payments made by benefactors. The Federal Court decision said that the definition in the Bankruptcy Act is confined to payments made in the context of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had the discontinuation of the High Court challenge, the suggested loophole in the legislation&mdash;the Federal Court and the Bond v. Ramsay loophole&mdash;is now to be addressed by this bill. The bill attempts to restore what was intended in the original amendments in 1992 dealing with income contribution from bankrupts and will also now cover loans to bankrupts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue which will have to be addressed&mdash;and I am indebted to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> for these comments&mdash;is the possibility that certain valid payments, for example legal aid, may fall within the definition of income or benefit. This potential problem was raised by the Hon. Justice Cooper in Bond v. Ramsay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the coalition that this matter should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. It is very important that the citizens of Australia&mdash;particularly, in my case, my constituents&mdash;have an opportunity to have their say and be able to reflect on some of the issues raised in the legislation and, in particular, some of the problems or queries that the Law Council of Australia and others have had with aspects of the technical application of the legislation, not the least of which is the possibility of the changes in the treatment of assets and the disposal of assets in the past becoming retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, in the past there have been some concerns from Western Australians in particular in relation to retrospective legislation, but I think that has to be balanced with the community's point of view that they are aggrieved by the apparent ease with which people like Mr Bond and, more importantly, Mr Skase have been able to escape the more stringent application of Australian bankruptcy law through the use of, in the case of Mr Bond, obviously very expensive and expert legal assistance by beating the federal government in the Federal Court and, in the case of Mr Skase, by running away to Spain and being able to win in the Spanish courts against the Australian government's warrant of extradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are two matters which many people in the community think are highly ridiculous. It seems to them very strange that Mr Bond was able to live this quite extravagant lifestyle while he was bankrupt and that, at the same time, Mr Skase was able to escape the clutches of Australian law, notwithstanding the enormous amount of money and the so-called expertise that was used to try to bring him back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions need to be resolved. This bill raises some solutions to a number of the problems brought up by the cases of Bond and Skase. But, in the final analysis, I agree with the coalition's proposition that the matter be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry, which would give others in the community an opportunity to have their say&mdash;not least the constituents of Moore, a number of whom would be concerned at some of the changes to the opportunities for people to be able to declare themselves bankrupt. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I wish to thank honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. Might I say that many of the contributions drew heavily on the submissions on the bill from the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia. The government is grateful for the interest expressed by those bodies to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I would like to say that those groups are only two of the stakeholders in this particular area of law. They are amongst welfare groups, financial counsellors, the Credit Reform Association of Australia, community legal centres, credit providers and the community generally. Whilst the Law Council and the IPAA's contributions are important, it is the government which must determine the appropriate policy in consultation with them and other groups. The submissions of these two organisations in many ways express disagreement or reservation about the policy, not about the manner in which the government proposes to implement the policy, contrary to what is suggested in the submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that both the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia and the Law Council have expressed their strong support for the majority of the reforms contained in this bill. In that light, it is important to respond to some of the major points made in those submissions and echoed by the opposition. Before I do so, I might refer to the remarks of the member for Moore (Mr Filing). His suggestion that this parliament has not sought to act expeditiously to deal with income contribution arrangements and to ensure that instances like the high profile bankruptcy of Alan Bond were not addressed is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 this parliament sought to enact legislation that would have copper-bottomed legal framework to prevent the passing on of income contributions from anyone to Mr Bond in such a way as to enable him to maintain a standard of living beyond that appropriate to a bankrupt. But, as has been indicated, the specific proposals that were brought forward by the government have been held, in a very technical judgment, in my view and in the view of many other commentators, by the Federal Court not to have covered the specifics of the Bond circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a mark of conspiracy of a federal government unwilling to address the specific issues in the case of Mr Bond and other like cases. Rather it is a mark of the confidence both sides of this parliament had in the passage of this legislation to enact a scheme which would satisfactorily address these matters. The confidence of my predecessor, former Senator Tate, who introduced the legislation, was reflected by similar confidence from opposition speakers at the time, and the legislation passed without any reservation that it would be deficient in the way the Federal Court ultimately found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that this matter has now had to come back to us because of that decision, it does so against a background where its necessity was not anticipated by any of the parties in this parliament. Whilst I think it is not unsurprising that the member for Moore, given the circumstances of his recent past, is a believer in conspiracy theories, I do not think that particular conspiracy theory has any substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can turn to some of the specifics that have been addressed, the opposition has expressed concern that no attempt has been made in the bill to achieve consistency with the Corporations Law. Indeed, in relation to antecedent transactions, the opposition argues that the bill will produce a further divergence between the Corporations Law and the act. The provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with the avoidance of antecedent transactions are simply not capable of being adapted to relate to the situation of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law is premised on the basis that a company must be managed so as to preserve its asset base and to maximise returns to shareholders through profitable activity. Giving away property, of course, is not conducive to that aim. But, when one tries to apply, for example, the uncommercial transaction definition of section 588FB of the Corporations Law to individuals, the results become absurd. An individual could very well benefit from giving away his or her property to a relative, family trust or company. A reasonable person might want to get tax benefits, for example, by asset planning or the person might wish to ensure that most of the wealth that he or she had generated would not be available to creditors in the result of a subsequent financial failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only detriment such a person suffers is that he or she depletes the assets that he or she owns directly. This may be, and frequently is, to their long-term advantage where the assets are owned by a relative or associated entity of the person which he or she is able to control or materially influence or control without having any direct legal apparatus of control. The Law Reform Commission, in its report on the general insolvency inquiry, recommended a provision to deal with transactions that undervalue, and the proposed section 120 provides for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been some comment about antecedent transactions. The opposition does not support the introduction of the new concept of technically insolvent, intended to become the cornerstone of the antecedent transactions provisions. There have been claims that the definition is wide and uncertain and is likely to lead to endless debate. The opposition has provided some hypothetical examples to illustrate the uncertainty permitted by the drafting and has focused on the position of guarantors under a loan. It also argued that the new provisions should not apply to transactions entered into prior to the commencement of the amending legislation. Whenever a new law is introduced, it takes time for case law to settle the meaning of particular expressions. That is not a process of endless debate but rather the traditional way in which the law develops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of technically insolvent is straightforward and requires an individual's entire financial position to be considered. It must be kept in mind that the term `technically insolvent' has no relevance until a person has become a bankrupt and only when the person has entered into a transaction which is possibly void against the trustee. The test requires the person's liabilities to be looked at against their assets and current income position at the time an impugned transaction is entered into&mdash;a balance sheet test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards guarantees, all that falls for examination is the individual's liability determined in accordance with a contract of guarantee&mdash;that is, the maximum potential liability of the individual. The liability of co-guarantors, sureties or the principal debtor are irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is putting a view that the policy of proposed change is wrong, a view which the government does not accept. A person who enters into a substantial guarantee for others' debts should not, in the government's view, be able to transfer assets away from himself or herself and thus diminish the pool of available assets in the event that he or she later becomes bankrupt. What is the meaning of a guarantee if a person can enter into one but avoid its consequences by transferring all his or her assets away, notwithstanding its existence? The proposition becomes laughable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has also attacked the use of market value as a determinant of whether a transaction is possibly void against a trustee as it may adversely affect someone who purchases property at a discount. There is nothing inappropriate about using market value as a determining factor for whether a transaction occurred at undervalue. Opinions will often differ about what is the actual market value of a thing. Opinions will usually give a range of values which may be the worth of a particular item. Whether a transfer of property took place at market value will be determined by inquiring whether the item was purchased below its minimum market value. The difficulty with the existing test is that it frequently allows related parties of a person who becomes a bankrupt to retain the benefit of a transaction even though the consideration given is substantially discounted and much less than the ordinary value&mdash;even returns that might be obtained at a fire sale. It must be remembered that allowing these transactions to stand could have an adverse impact on a person's creditors and a possible insolvency flow-on. I should also note that, while the Law Council has expressed reservations about the concept of market value, the IPAA has expressed strong support for it and has said it is an improvement on the existing law and is both a more readily identifiable and a more meaningful term than valuable consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been some discussion about retrospectivity in relation to the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions because they will apply to current bankruptcies. The explanatory memorandum to the bill makes it clear that a current bankruptcy is one where a final dividend has not been paid to creditors. This may be the case whether or not the bankrupt has been discharged from the bankruptcy. Obviously, the application of provisions is something to which very careful consideration is given. There are three categories that have to be addressed: persons who are not yet bankrupt, persons who are currently bankrupt and persons who have been previously bankrupt but are no longer bankrupt. Further, an estate may be finalised because all available property is realised before a person is discharged from bankruptcy. Equally, an estate could continue to be administered long after a bankrupt has been discharged, because, for example, the estate is entitled to a remainder demand interest in property subject to a life tenancy and the tenant for life does not die for many years after the discharge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions will operate in relation to bankruptcies where a final dividend has not been paid, whether or not a bankrupt has been discharged, and to all bankruptcies occurring after commencement. Having provisions apply to only prospective bankruptcies would have resulted in a system which was administratively complex and burdensome for trustees and creditors. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills noted that, although the amendments have retrospective operation, their purpose is to seek to increase the amount available for distribution to creditors whose rights to be paid in full may be considered to have been trespassed against. That statement encapsulates what the provisions are about and is sufficient justification for the proposed provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some reservations have also been expressed about the soundness of the policy which treats all benefits as income. In so far as the bill attempts to reverse the effect of the Bond decision, the opposition queries whether the proposed amendment will work. It is stated in paragraph 70 of the introduction to the explanatory memorandum that, when the income distribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to or on account of a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, worked for or provided service for or on behalf of a benefactor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Bond case Mr Justice Cooper, a member of the majority, commented that the payment of legal costs by a family or friends of a bankrupt would be indistinguishable in principle from a grant of legal aid. On the other hand, the dissenting judgment of Justice French stated that the provision should not be construed punitively as a matter of general principle and regarding legal aid payments as part of income would be a punitive interpretation. Our consideration will be given to specifying the fact that a person in receipt of publicly funded legal aid moneys is a ground for providing the hardship exemption to making contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bond judgment was closely studied. The decision turned on the use of the definition of `fringe benefit', which is a subset of the wider term `benefit' used in the legislation. It can be confidently expected that the effect of the decision has been overcome. The act provides that any provision of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has asserted that this delegation of legislative power should be condemned and may be open to constitutional challenge. This is a misconception. There is nothing unconstitutional about enabling provisions of an act to be varied by subordinate legislation. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, one of whose terms of reference is to comment on any inappropriate delegation of legislative power, made no reference to this whatsoever in its report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest No. 5</EMPHASIS> of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further concerns are expressed about the transfer of some functions presently carried out by the Federal Court to administrative bodies on the basis that changes may trespass on the judicial power of the Commonwealth as enunciated recently by the High Court in the well-known Brandy case. The bill, for example, proposes that the power to register trustees be exercised by an administrative panel. This is clearly an administrative function and is being done to honour an undertaking given to the former Chief Justice of the Federal Court that the court would be relieved of this particular function. The government is confident that nothing in the proposals could infringe the Brandy principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to debt agreements, it has been suggested that the sum of $20,000 for unsecured debts is too low and the higher sum of $50,000 might be more appropriate. There is a capacity to increase the amount by subordinate legislation. We think it is preferable to see how debt agreements work in practice before changing the monetary threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been some comments about the one-stop shop proposal of Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. Concerns have been expressed about the functions of ITSA being substantially expanded under the one-stop shop proposal. As well as administering bankrupt estates as it now does, ITSA would be able to become a controlling trustee and a trustee of part X deeds. This would further place ITSA in direct competition with private trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed that ITSA take over many functions now performed by the registrars in bankruptcy and that it administer debt agreements, but a concern has also been expressed about the potential of conflict of interests on the part of ITSA if it is to be simultaneously responsible for the administration of estates and the supervision of the conduct of private trustees. The rationalisation of bankruptcy administration is expected to produce resource savings and to provide a better service to the public, who will need to deal with only one administrative agency instead of two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conflict of interest problems are being dealt with by ITSA quarantining the bankruptcy regulation units through its general operations. The purpose of enabling the official trustee to be a trustee under part X is to avoid the need for court appointment of a trustee in the event of the death of the existing trustee or if for some other reason the original trustee cannot continue. No resources have been provided to ITSA to enable it to routinely take on part X administrations. It simply will not have the practical capacity to do so. The claims that these proposals are a grab by the empire builders in ITSA to enable them to take business away from private trustees are groundless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s a system was used to channel as much work as possible to registered trustees. A creditor or debtor had to demonstrate that he or she had taken reasonable steps to secure the consent of a registered trustee to act as a trustee in a bankruptcy. Approaches to three trustees was considered reasonable. It was a time consuming process and did not achieve the intended result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the statistics in the annual report on the operation of the act for the years 1981-82 and 1985-86 shows that a proportion of bankruptcy work taken on by registered trustees did not increase during that period. To make such an amendment would, on the basis of that experience, have no value in increasing the share of work taken on by registered trustees. Registered trustees are conducting businesses and it is up to them to promote and advertise their expertise and services, and by doing so increase their share of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving some minor amendments to the bill to correct some drafting errors which have been discovered, and which also have the effect of requiring information about alternatives to bankruptcy to be given to debtors before bankruptcy petitions are accepted so they can carefully consider those alternatives. Information will also be required to be provided about the services which are available from registered trustees, including their expertise in arranging part X administrations with creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has had the courtesy of advising me it intends to request this matter to be referred to a House committee for further detailed consideration. It is not the government's view to accede to that request. This is a matter which has had very extensive public contribution. It has been the subject of a Law Reform Commission report and extensive consultations. The measures are, in a sense, the result of those very extensive deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is anxious for the very cogent reason that has been addressed by a number of speakers, in particular the member for Moore, which is to make sure that the bankruptcy legislation, which is designed to give confidence to the public, will not only have the necessary teeth to deal with unscrupulous debtors but also be amended and simplified in a way which addresses sympathetically the concerns of small bankrupts who have found themselves in that circumstance because of business risk but without any malice or, in a sense, ill motive on their part. I would not wish to stay those proceedings in that environment when I know that House of Representatives committees are finding it difficult to obtain quorums and to meet and when I believe this legislation should go immediately to the Senate so it can be passed to the benefit of all the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to this matter, I will make some brief observations. I thank the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for his comments in relation to the matters raised by me and a number of my colleagues. The minister suggests that some members of the opposition are against the proposals in the legislation, but I am not sure that that is a fair comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we were foreshadowing was that concerns about a number of issues contained in this legislation have been expressed to us by the Insolvency Practitioners Association and the Law Council of Australia. In our view, that gave rise to the need for a further review of the legislation at this stage. We would be guided by the advice that might come from a committee that is considering the detail of the legislation. It would give those people who have made comments about the legislation an opportunity to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is correct in his observation of the role of the Law Reform Commission. I brought with me yesterday a copy of the report from the Law Reform Commission. That contained a very comprehensive tome of comments in relation to the bankruptcy law and comments about the proposed bill. There have also been additional papers which have ultimately led to the legislation in the modified form that we have before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned yesterday&mdash;and the minister may have had these comments drawn to his attention&mdash;the comments from the Insolvency Practitioners Association were in the hands of the government the day before we started this debate on the legislation. That did not allow an opportunity for detailed and comprehensive consideration of the points that were made. Similarly, the views of the Law Council, while they would have been available earlier, related to a bill that was not available in an exposure draft form. The bill was given a first reading in this parliament in March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise that parliamentary consideration of legislation which is very technical and which requires a good deal of deliberation will not take place in a debate of this sort when there has been short notice and a relatively short time to discuss it. The only way you can develop arguments and get a concluded view on matters of this sort is with a comprehensive committee consideration of the issues with witnesses involved and being heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This usually occurs in the Senate. I take the view that the Senate performs a very useful role in that regard, but I think this chamber is capable of performing the same role. I was alarmed to hear the minister say that committees are unable to get quorums and are unable to meet. Perhaps he might like to elaborate on what he means by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would regard it as a significant reflection on the government and its members if it is not able to ensure that the committee system of this parliament works. That is an extraordinary admission to make. That is certainly not my impression. The committees I am involved in&mdash;including those I am involved in as shadow minister&mdash;meet regularly and deliberate for long hours. Those committees are still undertaking references at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand how a committee of this parliament that is interested in legal and constitutional affairs would not be able to give a report quickly on an issue that is so important to the government. The government is trying to put it off. I will look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to see what other references the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is undertaking, but I suspect that it does not have too many references at this time. I suspect that this matter will come before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, but if the government wants the bill dealt with expeditiously then that is not the way to ensure that it happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has two current inquiries: the first is the interpretation and application of the provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution and the second is the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth. I do not think those two references&mdash;I know one of them is well advanced&mdash;would prevent the committee from being able to deal with this matter promptly and quickly and helping the parliament with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day I read that the Senate has some 80 bills before it. It is in a log jam. What we would be doing is adding to the Senate log jam. If the government wants this bill to be dealt with expeditiously, it seems to me that the best course would be to reconsider the approach that has been taken on this matter to date and to support my motion to enable the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to undertake this inquiry and, as I said, to report as soon as possible. We are not seeking delay. What we are seeking is elucidation and the improvement of legislation that is of importance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with the proposal to refer the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is that, whilst it has been asserted that it is some indictment on government, the committee systems are now working their way into circumstances where members may feel they have higher priorities, such as in their electoral circumstances. That is simply a reality. We are now reaching a time where many members are giving greater priority to their electoral circumstances, with the thought of the possibility of elections emerging.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is intended to allow privileges and immunities to be conferred upon the premises of, and persons associated with, certain overseas missions in Australia which represent self-governing or autonomous foreign territories that are not states and are not recognised by Australia as states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed legislation seeks to accommodate the changing political climate within our region, in which sovereign states are no longer the only players. Self-governing or autonomous foreign territories which are not states and which Australia does not recognise as states, such as Hong Kong, New Caledonia and the Cook Islands, are increasingly taking part in the economic and trade affairs of the region in their own right. This legislation seeks to provide a window of opportunity for such territories to establish official representation in Australia for the purposes of promoting bilateral trade and performing a liaison function regarding multilateral trade and economic issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, privileges and immunities are afforded to diplomatic and consular missions and their staff in Australia. This is done by virtue of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967 and the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1972 respectively, which reflect the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. Also, the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 affords privileges and immunities to international organisations and their staff where they establish a mission in Australia. The current legislation is deficient, however, in that it does not afford privileges and immunities to missions which do not represent sovereign states or international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill therefore flows from Australia's existing obligations under international law which relate to diplomatic and consular missions. It is further intended to fill the existing gap in legislation regarding missions from self-governing or autonomous entities. The privileges and immunities afforded under the legislation would protect the operations of the mission&mdash;thus assisting in the effective performance of their functions. I stress that the purpose of providing privileges and immunities is to facilitate the effective and unhindered operations of the missions. They are not intended for the benefit of individuals but are accorded solely in the interests of the mission, to enable it to perform its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to come within the scope of the bill, two conditions must be met. Firstly, the mission must be declared by regulation to be a `designated overseas mission'; and, secondly, the mission must be authorised to operate within certain capacities as set out in a written instrument signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. These conditions would also be subject to the agreement of the government, in consultation with others concerned. Clearly, however, the bill is not intended to cover missions in Australia representing purely political entities, such as the Palestine Liberation Organisation, or purely commercial entities such as Hutt River Province. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The form and operation of the bill is modelled on the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, in so far as the bill provides the framework and criteria within which privileges and immunities are set out and may be accorded. The bill itself would be given effect by the regulations made under it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedules to the bill set out a broad range of privileges and immunities of possible application to designated overseas missions. They represent the upper limit, so to speak, of the privileges and immunities which might be conferred upon the premises of a designated overseas mission and the persons associated with it. The privileges and immunities listed are along the lines of those conferred by the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. However, under no circumstances would a designated overseas mission or any person associated with it be entitled to privileges and immunities which go beyond those conferred by the Vienna conventions upon diplomatic or consular missions and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be possible for the regulations to confer upon designated overseas missions any or all of the privileges and immunities listed, either unconditionally or subject to limitations or conditions. They would be specifically tailored to provide a precise and comprehensive account of the privileges and immunities applicable in each case. The use of the regulations in this way is consistent with the precedent already set by the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act. Furthermore, they maintain flexibility within the legislation and allow the government to limit or qualify the application of privileges and immunities on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is anticipated that the first occasion for the application of the legislation would arise in the context of the proposed establishment of a Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Sydney in the second half of 1995. A Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office would cover bilateral commercial relations between Hong Kong and Australia and conduct a liaison function where multilateral trade issues, including WTO and APEC, are concerned. The application of the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill may result in a loss of revenue at both the Commonwealth and state or territory levels due to certain privileges of a financial nature which could be accorded to the premises of a designated overseas mission and persons associated with that mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privileges which could be accorded include exemptions from taxation levied directly against the mission regarding its property and personal exemptions from taxation for persons associated with the mission. It is preferable to allow for the possibility of such exemptions from taxation in order to maintain consistency with the application of privileges under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations and to enable missions to operate effectively within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to speculate at this stage on the possible losses to be incurred. Any losses to revenue would be determined by the number of missions which are entitled to financial privileges under the legislation and the extent of the privileges accorded to such missions. However, any loss in revenue would be far outweighed by the potential for economic gain which the presence and operations of such missions would incur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The missions would boost Australia's bilateral trade interests and provide greater scope for Australia regarding multilateral trade opportunities within the region. Furthermore, the bill would create a basis for the reciprocal extension of privileges and immunities, enabling the Australian government to reduce the costs of Australian offices in the territory represented by the designated overseas mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill seeks to provide a framework to enable privileges and immunities to be conferred on overseas missions in Australia and their staff. It is an adaptation of fundamental principles of international law to the reality of our regional environment. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OVERSEAS MISSIONS (PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is intended to make consequential amendments to Commonwealth acts which will enable the effective implementation of the principal bill; that is, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill 1995. As has been noted already today, the principal bill allows privileges and immunities to be accorded to missions representing self-governing or autonomous foreign territories in Australia and their staff. It flows from existing legislation which accords privileges and immunities to diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations in Australia, and their staff. However, the intention of the principal bill is to adapt this existing legislation to the realities of our changing economic regional climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure the effective implementation of the principal bill, the consequential amendments bill would make amendments to a number of Commonwealth acts. In particular, amendments would be made to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act 1978 and the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly speaking, these acts provide protection to the premises of, and persons associated with, diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. The consequential amendments bill would extend their scope to provide appropriate protection to the premises of missions established under the principal bill, and their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Protective Service Act establishes the Australian Protective Service and sets out its functions, which include, among other things, the protection of property in which a foreign country or an international organisation has an interest. The functions of the Australian Protective Service also include the protection of internationally protected persons. The consequential amendments bill would extend this act to protect property in which a mission established in accordance with the principal bill has an interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act enacts into Australia's domestic law the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including diplomatic agents. Under the act, as it presently stands, the Governor-General may make regulations declaring persons who are not specifically mentioned in the convention to be internationally protected persons&mdash;for example, persons associated with international organisations. The consequential amendments bill would expand the application of the act and allow the Governor-General to make regulations declaring certain persons associated with missions established under the principal bill to be internationally protected persons and afforded protection as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act prohibits the improper use of diplomatic and consular signs and titles which falsely purport to represent a diplomatic or consular mission. The consequential amendments bill would expand the protection afforded by the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act to cover missions established under the principal bill. It would also ensure that the authorised activities of a mission established under the principal bill would not amount to prohibited activities in so far as they may overlap with activities carried out by diplomatic and consular missions, and vice versa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act enacts into domestic law Australia's international obligations to preserve public order in respect of the premises and personnel of diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. The consequential amendments bill would extend protection under that act to missions established under the principal bill, consistent with these existing international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment of the Australian Protective Service Act, expanding the functions of the Australian Protective Service to cover missions established under the principal bill and to certain persons associated with it, may require an increase in the resources devoted to the service. The amount of such an increase is not quantifiable at this stage and will depend on the number of missions requiring such protection. However, I emphasise that the economic gain which would result from the presence and operations of the missions given privileges and immunities under the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill would outweigh the costs of extending the protective service to those missions. The other amendments would have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, the consequential amendments bill would facilitate the effective implementation of the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill. The consequential amendments would extend protections afforded by existing legislation to missions and their staff established under the principal bill. I recommend the bill to the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports both the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill and the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) (Consequential Amendments) Bill, and the general notion of expanding Australian commercial and semi-diplomatic ties with regional territories and self-governing bodies. We do, however, have a couple of concerns, to which I will return shortly. I do not want to hold up the House unduly this morning, but there are a few points that this side needs to make in the context of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill 1995 is intended to extend certain consular privileges and immunities to trade and diplomatic missions within Australia from overseas non-state, self-governing or autonomous entities. It is anticipated that a number of overseas trade missions would be established if such a status were available and, as the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) indicated, these would perhaps include Hong Kong, New Caledonia and the Cook Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, the accompanying bill, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities)(Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995 would amend four existing acts so as to provide protection to the premises of, and persons associated with, designated overseas missions in the same way as is applicable to staff and property of diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated, four acts will need consequential amendments: firstly, the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, which would allow for the protection of property by the Australian Protective Service; secondly, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, which would allow for the Governor-General to make regulations declaring certain persons associated with a designated overseas mission to be internationally protected persons; thirdly, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act 1978, which is designed to protect against false representations or unofficial missions. The amendments to this act would ensure that any missions which would come under the proposed overseas missions bill could not falsely purport to represent the activities of diplomatic or consular missions. The final act which will require a consequential amendment is the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971, which would ensure protection of newly accredited missions in line with Australia's obligations to protect existing diplomatic and consular missions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated, the general structure of the legislation is based on that already in place for the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963. It allows the foreign minister to grant overseas mission status to specific missions according to regulation and on a case by case basis, which is very important in the context of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations could be applied so that a designated overseas mission would be entitled to any or all of those privileges and immunities which are listed in the schedules to the legislation, and would be available either unconditionally or subject to limitations or conditions specified in the regulations. In effect, the minister can craft specific privileges and immunities for each proposed overseas mission as it is considered&mdash;again, on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated, there are two schedules, the first of which deals with privileges and immunities relative to the missions themselves. These privileges include inviolability of the mission and mission property, protection of mission communications and documents, including access to diplomatic channels, exemption from taxes on mission property and mission related business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second schedule provides for privileges and immunities of persons associated with designated overseas missions. The list of possible privileges and immunities includes inviolability of designated mission staff private residences, exemption from taxation, exemption from laws relating to immigration and work permits and immunities from arrest, search or detention. There will be marginal revenue losses flowing from the property and personal tax exemptions. There may also be an increase in costs associated with the need for additional resources for the Australian Protective Service. These lead to the coalition's first concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made no estimation of the specific costs other than to note that it expects them to be offset by two factors, which were alluded to by the minister at the table: first, the extension of reciprocity to Australian property and personnel within those overseas territories which would benefit from the bill; and, second, an increase in Australian trade opportunities in those territories which establish missions here in Australia. In the coalition's view, it would be helpful&mdash;and I make this point to the Special Minister of State at the table&mdash;to have a more detailed analysis of the budgetary implications from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second concern is about immunity from criminal prosecution for overseas mission staff. We feel that this point will need to be considered very carefully. It should not be extended as a matter of general right, as with full diplomatic and consular missions. In granting appropriate status under the legislation, we hope that the foreign minister will give special attention to this point in his case by case consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a final and more general note, I make the point that the government has allowed its approach to bilateral relations to be clouded by an obsession with multilateral structures. Undoubtedly such structures are important. However, they are not the be-all and end-all for good international relations. Conflict resolution will rarely be achieved by multilateral structures. In the coalition's view, we need to concentrate all our efforts in effective bilateral relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills represent a perfunctory and overdue attempt to place more focus on bilateral relations rather than on the government's overblown self-congratulations associated with treaty signing. Unlike this government, we will, as the next government, reverse that trend with treaty references, firstly, by providing for significant parliamen</PARA>
<PARA>tary debate prior to ratification; secondly, by establishing a treaties council as part of the COAG machinery; thirdly, by more appropriate use of the external affairs power, unlike this government; and, finally, by the possible formation of a joint treaties committee of the parliament to carry out more detailed analysis of the treaty making process. Subject to the caveats I have outlined, we commend both bills to the House. </PARA>

Essentially, those involved must be declared by regulation to be a designated overseas mission and must, in turn, be authorised to act in capacities as established in written instruments signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of this country. Theoretically, it has a very broad application. We have heard earlier that it will not apply to what are essentially political propaganda operations such as West Papuan organisations, the Palestine Liberation Organisation or north Cypriot information services. Theoretically, it could apply, as I understand it, to federated states within a particular federation. Theoretically, it could apply&mdash;and obviously this is changing every day&mdash;to Ciskei and Transkei, et cetera, within South Africa. It could have theoretical application to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. </PARA>

Despite the fact that the financial outcomes have not been itemised ad nauseam, the reality is that at the moment Hong Kong is Australia's fifth largest destination for foreign investment, we have the fourth largest presence in manufacturing, we constitute over six per cent of total investment there and 300 Australian companies are presently employing over 70,000 people there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the situation in Hong Kong is dramatically changing with the process towards incorporation with China.

If it is not overdue, it certainly is needed. </PARA>

In the year to March 1994 they represented $63 million, and jumped to $84 million in the year to March 1995.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All three cited examples of who might benefit are worth while.

They are largely, as stated earlier, in the area of taxation, protection and immunity in regard to criminal prosecutions, et cetera. It was stated earlier that we should not be too forward in according these privileges to these missions. Essentially, we have to be reasonable about these things. We have an elected government in this country. Whichever side of the House is running the place, it will be sensible about whom these privileges are extended to. It is fundamentally related to Australia's economic needs. There are a variety of government units that do not fall within the normal mainstream of states that Australia recognises as such.

<PARA>The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill contains a number of proposed technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 of a minor or administrative nature. Most of the proposed amendments were recommended for legislative amendment by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election, tabled on 16 November 1994. They are directed mainly at improving operational procedures in the conduct of elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will enable the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate to staff its powers to supply and charge for goods and services and provide that such goods and services may be supplementary or an alternative to those already supplied under joint rolls arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states. The bill will also allow the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate its powers under any law, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act, under which the commission conducts periodic ATSIC elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes two provisions to protect the peace of mind and health of the elderly and infirm. Firstly, it will improve the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee. Secondly, the bill will prohibit canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also allow for electors whose enrolment has been objected to, to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of the rolls. This will help to ensure that only entitled electors vote. The bill will ensure that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes, enhancing the secrecy of the ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use state-of-the-art methods of security printing of ballot papers instead of using outdated watermarked ballot papers. This will result in considerable savings in ballot paper storage and production costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will extend the right to vote to all divisional returning officers and Australian electoral officers and standardise the method for resolving ties during the counting of votes. The bill will also extend the two-candidate preferred count, as conducted in polling places on polling night, to the fresh scrutiny and declaration votes scrutinies, as conducted later by the divisional returning officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three amendments to this bill which are proposed to be moved on behalf of the government which would greatly assist the Australian Electoral Commission's efficiency in conducting the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>1.An amendment improving the drafting of the provision enabling the Electoral Commission to empower its staff to enter into agreements to supply and charge for goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA>2.At the request of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;and I might add with the blessing of the Privacy Commission&mdash;a new provision for gender data on electors for the purpose of medical research and health screening programs. Currently those conducting approved medical research and health screening programs may be provided with names and addresses of electors from the Commonwealth electoral roll. However, some of those programs, notably breast screening programs, require the names and addresses of female electors only. </PARA>
<PARA>3.The third amendment will enable the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct Senate scrutinies by a computer. The computer program will follow the principles of the manual process. It will also allow far better access by scrutineers to information such as preferences on ballot papers, whose details will be stored within the computer system. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">This includes information on informal ballot papers and `wild card' papers that are not formal but not in accordance with party tickets. A record of ballot papers notionally transferred at each count and the progress of the count of the vote will also be available. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">The commission has conducted demonstrations of the proposed system for political party representatives in each state and territory and for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The commission estimates that it will save approximately $370,000 at each Senate election by using this system. However, the greater advantage of the proposed system is that it will reduce the time taken to distribute preferences from weeks to hours and should allow the Senate count to be finalised about the same time as the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) rightly said, some of these proposed amendments were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election which was tabled on 16 November last year. As the deputy chairman of that committee, I have participated in those discussions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the suggested amendments are of a pro forma nature. Some are as simple as removing hyphens from a range of words throughout the legislation. The bill also ensures that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes. Silent enrolment electors do not have their addresses publicly displayed on the electoral roll, on the grounds that this would place the personal safety of the electors or their families at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently had occasion to advise a constituent in my electorate to become a silent elector. That has taken place. This demonstrates that, while we think we live in a free and open society, there are circumstances when one does not have to be a judicial personage or somebody with a major public profile to seek this right. This is open to people generally who feel that the accessibility of their personal details through the electoral roll could, in one way or another, be a threat to their security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation currently provides that the address of a silent enrolment elector be removed from the postal vote application before being made available for inspection. There is information such as phone numbers, postal addresses and the names and addresses of witnesses on the application which could help identify the elector's address if it were available. As the report of the joint committee observed, this clearly undermines the intent of the silent enrolment provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also improves the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee. Section 118(4) of the Electoral Act provides that such an objection must be accompanied by a certificate issued by a medical practitioner which states that, in the practitioner's opinion, the elector is of unsound mind and cannot understand the nature and significance of enrolment and voting procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the act, a challenged elector may answer an objection. This amending legislation allows for electors whose enrolment has been objected to, to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of the rolls. This will help to ensure that only electors entitled to enrol are able to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also allows the Australian Electoral Commission to use a more up-to-date method of security printing of ballot papers for referenda and elections instead of using watermarked ballot papers which will result in considerable savings in both paper storage and production costs. Since 1915, the Electoral Act has required that ballot papers be authenticated by an official watermark, which the AEC believes is both costly and now technically obsolete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the joint standing committee also observed that if the security printing process, as used for chequebooks, was used to produce ballot papers, the AEC would not be obliged to store stocks of watermarked paper to cater for at least two elections. Also as an official mark for identification, security printing would probably prove superior to watermarking&mdash;for example, security printing could be such that erasures could not be disguised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will disallow canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day. Special hospitals are hospitals declared by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. They include convalescent homes and similar institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current act, canvassing near or within hospitals that are polling places and special hospitals is disallowed from the day of issue of the writ for an election until the end of polling day or the expiration of the last day to which polling was adjourned. The bill extends the right to vote in elections to all divisional returning officers and Australian Electoral Commission officers and standardises the method of resolving ties during the counting of votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It extends the two-candidate preferred count, as conducted in polling places on polling night, to the fresh scrutiny and declaration votes scrutinies, as conducted later by the divisional returning officer. Consequently, a two-candidate preferred count will be applied to declaration votes scrutinies in all electorates. In the 1993 election, the two-candidate preferred count was applied to scrutiny of the declaration vote only in those electorates identified as close at the end of counting on election night. The recent inquiry by the committee was advised by the AEC as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is support within the AEC for extending the [two candidate preferred count] to declaration vote scrutinies in all Divisions and reporting those figures through media releases. If the [two candidate preferred] count from polling places was checked, corrected as necessary, and continued as an integral part of the declaration scrutinies, there should be no need to delay the formal distribution of preferences until counting of all first preference votes is finalised. Declaration of the Poll could be based on the [two candidate preferred] figure, except in very close three cornered contests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also ensures that posters and car stickers are included in those forms of advertising which require authorisation. It provides that letters to the editor of a newspaper are exempt from the full requirements of the authorisation provisions in elections and referenda and that only the author's name and suburb or locality are to be shown. This amendment is made to address the security and privacy problems which currently exist as a result of the requirement for full address details to be shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also abolishes the obligation for the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise in two newspapers in a state or territory the receipt and particulars of the writ for the election of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate or for a referendum, as well as notices relating to redistributions and mini-redistributions. It is now proposed that such notices be published in only one newspaper circulating generally in a state or territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As referred to earlier, the government has proposed a number of new amendments to its original bill. One amendment enables the AEC to conduct the Senate scrutiny using a computer process and another allows for the provision of the gender of electors for the purpose of medical research and health screening surveys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fairly non-controversial nature of most of the legislation, the coalition does have a number of concerns. For example, there was some questioning about the need for authorisation of car stickers, in that most people would not be able to read an authorisation on the back of a speeding car at the very best of times. The government, however, claims that car stickers are not only placed on cars, which is probably a valid point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern, particularly for those who object to compulsory voting, is amendment 42 of schedule 1 and amendment 8 of schedule 2, which provides that the divisional returning officer may arrange for delivery of the non-voting penalty notice by means other than the post. The government has argued that the amendment will provide for greater flexibility in remote areas where mail services may be unreliable. The provision will also allow the delivery of notices by field officers in those areas where they operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, some believe that the change from the two-newspaper requirement may disadvantage readers in the larger states, such as Victoria and New South Wales, where there are two daily newspapers. The coalition is looking at moving an amendment in this respect in the Senate as it does not see the change as necessary. In states where there is only one major  local newspaper circulating generally, the AEC can always take out its second advertisement in a newspaper like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, as I am informed has happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also has concerns about age discrimination on the part of the Electoral Commission. Later, I will seek to incorporate a letter to one of my constituents from the local acting divisional returning officer of the AEC on this question. The coalition has been approached by a number of casual employees of the AEC, claiming that they have been told that their services are no longer required by the AEC as they are over the age of 65. The AEC says the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act does not provide cover for people over 65. It is worth noting that the government has been promising to eliminate age discrimination across its departments since 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have continued to oppose this. I moved legislation to the effect of removing age discrimination from Commonwealth employment two years ago. I have a re-run of that legislation coming before the House next week. It is not unreasonable, therefore, that we will be moving an appropriate amendment in the Senate to cover this particular point. I seek leave from the minister to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the text of a letter from the Electoral Commission. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has recently adopted a policy not to employ people over the age of 65 years as it is not able to offer the same terms and conditions of employment as apply to staff under 65 years, particularly regarding workers compensation cover. The recent introduction of legislation which makes it unlawful to terminate an employee's employment for reasons including age does not apply to employees engaged for a specified period of time or for a specified task, for example, as polling officials or electoral roll review casuals. The introduction of this legislation has, however, highlighted our inability to offer similar terms and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEC has received legal advice confirming that the policy is not unlawful and, whilst the policy may appear to be inconsistent with the recent Government initiatives, the issue is a complex one. This has been recognised by the establishment of an interdepartmental Task Force to facilitate the formation of the Government's policy on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEC will be carefully considering any changes flowing from this review of Commonwealth policy so that it is in step with the Government's views.

<PARA>As I noted, letters along those lines have been received by many hundreds of people presumably across Australia. As we all know from our regular dealings with our own electoral offices, a surprising number of staff are involved. Many of them are former teachers; many of them are retired people. They all do an excellent job for Australia in performing a critical series of functions in relation to the electoral process. The opposition believes it is absolutely absurd that people who are perfectly efficient in every other respect should be denied employment and denied a rightful place in the electoral process simply because of their age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three sets of amendments which we will be moving in the Senate. They are designed, as I said, to end age discrimination against Australian Electoral Commission employees over the age of 65, to allow those registered as general postal voters to be sent ballot papers as soon as possible after the issue of the writ for an election, and to allow political parties, members and senators access to the gender of electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to age discrimination, we have been approached by a number of employees on this matter. In view of the type of work they do, I think it is absolutely absurd that a 65 mandatory age be applied to employees of the AEC. It is worth noting in this context that there are in fact only 81 officers of the Commonwealth Public Service employed at the age of 65. Out of the many hundreds of thousands we have, only 81 fit that description. This demonstrates how absurd it is to argue that having older workers somehow removes the opportunities for employment for younger workers, which is a canard which has been used by those on the other side in this debate for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the question of ballot papers for general postal voters. We will be moving amendments to this effect in the Senate as well. They are designed to ensure that declaration envelopes and ballot papers are sent to those registered as general postal voters as soon as practicable after the issue of the writ for an election. The proposal is consistent with a minority report of the coalition members on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which was not included, regrettably, in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the government intends to move an amendment that allows for the provision of gender of electors for the purpose of medical research and health screening surveys. There is a good case for people to have access to the gender of electors as happens in some states, certainly those states which have their own electoral rolls, and it would be useful if it were applied federally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth set of amendments, regarding the two-newspaper requirement, which I have already referred to, will go some way towards solving a problem we see in that area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 contains a number of proposed technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 of a minor or administrative nature. They are necessary to resolve various practical problems which have arisen in electoral administration and to improve operational procedures in the conduct of elections and referendums. For those in the gallery at the moment, this is pretty dry. It is not the most exciting bill that we will debate in this House. Nonetheless, it is a necessary piece of legislation. Many of the bills here are fairly dry in nature but essential for good government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the proposed amendments were recommended for legislative amendment by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election tabled on 16 November 1994. They have been included in the bill as they require early attention to enable the Australian Electoral Commission to be fully prepared for the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major provisions of the bill relate to the following issues: firstly, to enable the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate to staff its powers to supply and charge for goods and services and provide that such goods and services may be supplementary or an alternative to those already supplied under joint rolls arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states; and, secondly, to delegate its powers under any law. At present the AEC can delegate its powers under the Electoral Act to the Electoral Commissioner. The joint standing committee recommended that the commission be permitted to delegate its powers under any other law as well as under the Electoral Act. The recommendation followed a request by the AEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC also has powers under statutes other than the Electoral Act. For example, it conducts elections under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988. An example of a responsibility that cannot at present be delegated but must be exercised by the commission itself is the appointment of polling places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedures exist under the Electoral Act for voters of unsound mind to be removed from the electoral roll. Under subsection 114(1) of the Electoral Act, it is a requirement that a person objecting to a person's enrolment must live in the same subdivision as the voter and must lodge a $2 fee. The joint committee reported that a consequence of these requirements is that voters of unsound mind are not removed from the rolls and that non-voter levels are therefore higher than necessary. The joint standing committee recommended that the Electoral Act be amended so that an elector objecting to the enrolment of another elector on the basis of unsound mind not be required to live in the same subdivision and not be required to lodge a $2 fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended a change in procedures where an objection has been lodged to the enrolment of a voter. At present, subsection 118(5) of the Electoral Act prevents a divisional returning officer from removing an elector's name from the roll between the date on which writs are issued and the close of polling, even where the DRO has already decided that the elector's name should be removed. The Joint Standing Committee dates this provision from before 1983&mdash;that is, when it was possible for the rolls to close the same day the writ was issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint standing committee recommended that the Electoral Act be amended to provide that the period from which a DRO cannot remove an elector's name from the roll following an objection action should commence at the close of the rolls. The committee also recommended that section 209A of the Electoral Act be amended to provide that ballot papers may be printed using either a security mark approved by the AEC or a watermark. In evidence before the joint standing committee, the AEC stated that existing legislation which requires authentication of ballot papers by the use of a watermark is both costly and technologically obsolete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC estimates that approximately $2.3 million would be saved over each three-year parliamentary term if ballot papers were to be produced using security printing arrangements instead of the existing watermarked paper. Savings are attributable to reduce storage, handling and freight costs as well as production costs. The AEC proposed the use of a security mark, such as that used for cheque books. An added advantage of a security mark, according to the joint committee, is that its use would make erasures more difficult to disguise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation of the committee was to increase the protections provided to silent enrolment electors who make postal vote applications. Persons who considers that the appearance of their address on the publicly available Commonwealth electoral roll would endanger their own safety or that of their family may make a request to the DRO that their address either not appear on the roll or be removed from the roll. This is called silent enrolment. The DRO must be given details of the risk faced by the applicant, and a request must be verified by statutory declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications for postal votes are available for public inspection. While postal vote applications available for public inspection do not list the residential address of a silent enrolment elector, they do contain information such as postal address and telephone number. The public availability of this type of information may also endanger the safety of the silent enrolment elector.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint standing committee recommended that, with the exception of the elector's name, all information on postal vote applications for silent enrolment electors should be deleted prior to public inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Electoral Act contains a provision which precludes divisional returning officers who are enrolled in electorates in which they are the DRO from voting in an election for the House of Representatives in that electorate. In the past DROs had a casting House of Representatives vote when an election result was tied. In its 1986 report the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform recommended that, where a tied vote occurred, the outcome should be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns rather than by a casting vote of a DRO. This recommendation was implemented in 1990 by an amendment to the Electoral Act. Because a DRO no longer has a casting vote, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concluded in its 1994 report that it was inappropriate for a DRO to be disqualified from voting in the House of Representatives electorate for which he or she is the DRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another adjustment which will be made through this legislation relates to the counting of declaration votes. The situation at the moment, as it was over the last election, is that on election night there is what is called a two-candidate preferred count. The situation is that in each polling booth in Australia the votes that are cast are counted to primary votes and are then nominally passed across into preference piles towards the likely two major candidates in terms of an election result, which would normally be the coalition candidate and the Labor candidate. In that way we get a fair, reasonable and accurate picture of what the result will be in that electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that does not include those votes that have been cast in other circumstances&mdash;say, postal votes, prepoll votes and other declaration votes. The circumstances are that those votes are counted post-election night and are in a situation where that two-party preferred count is not done until the final distribution of preferences in the finalisation of that particular local election. That, in a close election, effectively ensures that the result may take longer to establish. Therefore, the proposal here is to extend that two-party preferred throw across to those declaration votes and, in that way, help to remove uncertainty about results and therefore, potentially, the result of an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other minor amendments to the legislation. One other one which I understand is being introduced as an amendment to the bill is the allowance for the AEC to conduct computerised scrutiny of Senate ballot papers for the Senate count. The computerised scrutiny process is designed to deal with those ballot papers which are included in the central scrutiny process. These ballot papers are the below the line ballot papers where electors have chosen to number the ballot paper exhaustively for each candidate on the ballot paper. Depending on the size of the ballot paper, this would involve placing a number against, say, 60 candidates, as was the case in New South Wales in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Below the line ballot papers represent about six per cent of the formal vote. The percentage varies from state to state, with Tasmania having the highest. Six per cent of the formal vote does not really sound like a lot of ballot papers, but in fact the buying of paper involved is quite staggering. In the larger states there are about 150,000 ballot papers in the central scrutiny. These ballot papers weigh 1,500 kilograms and require an extremely large space when they are being counted and sorted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, what is involved is the question of those people who have taken the time to vote below the line rather than designate a number in a box above the line for a particular party or slate of candidates. If the voters decide to number it right the way through, the result is that those ballot papers require more detailed scrutiny and counting, and that effectively slows down the overall count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The computerised scrutiny process will be faster than the manual process. In the past, the AEC has been unable to guarantee that the poll would be declared by the end of June should an election be held any later than early May in the year in which a Senate election is due. With computerised scrutiny, it is expected that we would be able to cope with an election called at the end of May, some two weeks later than would normally be the case. This is because we are talking about a process which is significantly quicker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The computerised scrutiny process will be cheaper than the manual system. The expectation is that, by using the computerised system in an election, there will be a saving of around $370,000 nationally. This is because there will be less need for casual assistance and the training of that casual assistance in order to allow the counting to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the computerised system, the requirement will be that the actual ballot paper be entered into a computer on an individual basis. That sounds terribly time consuming and, in terms of an initial count, I guess it is. The fact is that potentially up to 60 candidates can contest a Senate ballot. The result is that those preferences have to be counted for the number of vacancies required, and then almost all those below the line votes have to be recounted and recounted again. Although it may cost some time in terms of the initial development of a process, in terms of conducting a full Senate election it will speed up the process significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also provide a lot of interesting information which can be used for people who have an interest in electoral matters. For instance, some people may wish to look at what the result would have been in a particular state or area if there were more vacancies than already existed. Also, it can be used to look at informal voting patterns to see whether patterns occur and, therefore, whether action needs to be taken to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a casual vacancy which was not normal, in the sense that it was not a candidate from a major party&mdash;for example, the vacancy left in 1990 when Senator Wood, from New South Wales, was determined to have been ineligible&mdash;the recount required in those circumstances would be a lot quicker. It would certainly ensure greater accuracy, consistency and efficiency in terms of the overall process. In that way, it is certainly worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn briefly beyond that to the report of Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters looking into the 1993 federal election. Many of these recommendations have come from that report. I wish to also focus on a couple of other issues which elements of this proposed legislation relate to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key issues which was debated across the table between the coalition and the government during the committee's inquiry was electoral integrity. Essentially, a range of concerns about fraud within the electoral system were raised by some people who had made written and verbal submissions to the inquiry and also by some members of the committee. Some very interesting evidence was taken on those matters. I stress that interesting though it may have been, conclusive it was not&mdash;and in many respects accurate, in relation to the actual situation we faced at that election, it was not. On the question of electoral integrity and electoral fraud, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, all objective evidence indicates that fraud is not a significant occurrence and did not influence any result at the 1993 federal election.</PARA>
<PARA>To quote the AEC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . some of the measures discussed [would] tend disproportionately to affect underprivileged or marginal members of society. The burden of inconvenience on voters could well serve to reduce the high level of voluntary compliance with compulsory enrolment and voting which has largely been forthcoming in Australia. Both of these factors would tend to diminish rather than enhance the legitimacy of Australian election processes.</PARA>
<PARA>That relates directly to proposals made by members of the committee and which are included in the coalition members' dissenting report. This includes potential changes that may be made to the Australian electoral system to address the alleged fraud that some maintain could possibly be occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on the committee changed over time. Initially, we had people being quite forthright with respect to their firm belief that this had occurred. The basic underlying political premise was that the government had stolen the election. But the circumstances are that debate ensued, discussions occurred with the AEC and evidence was produced to refute it. The debate then went along the lines, `We're not necessarily saying this happened, but it could happen in these circumstances in these positions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole range of issues was suggested, to which I think that quote directly relates. One suggestion was the use of a voter card. Voters who attend at a polling booth would be required to produce a card that had been sent to them in the mail by the AEC. If they did not produce that card, they would be forced to do a declaration vote and their circumstances would be checked later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The voter card system was tested in Victoria about 12 months ago at a by-election for the seat of Coburg. There have been elections in Victoria conducted by the state electoral office since then, but it has decided not to continue with that particular proposal at this stage. There is a range of reasons for that decision. For one thing, some 13 or 14 per cent of people did not bring the voter card with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This voter card system was being used on a voluntary basis in the council in which I was a councillor before I was elected to this parliament. In those circumstances, it is of major assistance to people of non-English-speaking background. But it is a voluntary thing: you do not have a situation where your vote is effectively challenged and forced to be a declaration vote in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the system is that people who have mislaid their card may have to go through what could be a daunting process at a booth in filling out a declaration vote. This would mean that the number of declaration votes would increase dramatically. Therefore, the time taken to process the votes would increase dramatically and we could go back to the unfortunate situation of having queues to vote. Essentially, the system would disadvantage people who were not articulate and who were not experienced in dealing with the official processes of voting in the circumstances that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another suggestion was for the closure of electoral rolls as soon as an election is called, thus ensuring that people do not have a chance to `jump' electorates in terms of their enrolment. All the evidence shows that that does not occur. The fact is that there are many thousands of people who, for some reason, did not get around to registering, did not think about it or were unaware of the need to. They do not ensure that their enrolment is up to date prior to an election being called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When an election is called the advertisements go out and the media is full of it. This focuses people's minds on the need to ensure that they can play their part in the democratic process. Closing rolls as soon as an election is called would disenfranchise thousands of people and, in those circumstances, it would be totally unfair and unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposal was the reintroduction of subdivision voting. Essentially, subdivision voting&mdash;which is something we had some years ago in this country&mdash;means that I could vote at, say, only two, three or four booths that directly relate to my residence. If I tried to vote somewhere else outside that area, I would be forced to do a declaration vote and I would have grave difficulty in exercising my democratic right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current system allows people some flexibility in that it allows them to cast votes in different locations. One of the great things about our electoral system is that people are encouraged to vote. It is made as easy as possible for them to be able to exercise that vote while still maintaining safeguards. The system is reviewed on a continuing basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AEC will react and has, on occasions, reacted to examples that have shown through from the operation of this system where there may have been some form of illegality. All the evidence, which particularly relates to multiple voting, is that there are very few occasions where that occurs. It has occurred on a number of occasions in the last election process but, where they have occurred, the circumstances of the margins on those occasions meant that they did not affect any results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often there were explanations for these errors, such as a name having been incorrectly crossed off on a roll or, alternatively, disabled, aged or infirm people who may have gone to vote and then a member of the family has come down later in the day and said, `You had better come down and vote.' So they have said, `Okay, fine, I forgot about it.' Many instances have been able to be explained. In those circumstances, the evidence is not there to suggest anything like the problems that were being suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue raised was compulsory voting. I anticipate that some speakers from the opposition may raise this and other issues in their contributions further in the debate. There are even major disagreements within the Liberal Party on compulsory voting. When this issue was raised by Senator Nick Minchin, who is a member of the committee, former Senator Chris Puplick engaged in radio interviews attacking Senator Minchin's position on this issue as being unreasonable, unfair and almost undemocratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill as it stands is a worthy improvement to the existing system. It is a system, like any system, which has to evolve over time. That is why it requires finetuning. We have an electoral system in this country which is the envy of many parts of the world. It is a system which ensures fairness, justness and equality. It is a system which has served the country well over the last hundred years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the speedy passage of this bill in the lead-up to the next election. I am sure that, as a result of it, we will have a fairer system. I look forward to the results of that system coming forth in the next election with the return of the Keating government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill, as has already been remarked on by previous speakers, involves a series of technical amendments that will finetune the electoral process. There are only a couple of matters that I intend to discuss. Australia's electoral system is important in that it must be seen to work properly without fear or favour if the electorate at large is to have any confidence in our democratic system. Fortunately, to date we have reason to have confidence in our electoral process and the operations of the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need, however, to be constantly vigilant in the protection of our democratic rights and ensure our electoral laws are the best available to us. It is bills such as this one which, though technical, ensure that the best possible electoral laws exist. These amendments have not just fallen out of the sky, as demonstrated by the previous speaker, the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin). Some were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 election. Others, no doubt, are recommendations of the AEC which have arisen through the process of internal reviews, monitoring and evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the rules and procedures of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, it is essential to distinguish between the issues of good law and the type of electoral system we have. There has been some considerable discussion of the type of electoral system employed for Senate elections. This has largely been spearheaded by our part-time Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the New South Wales election, there has also been public comment on the fact that a party which does not achieve a majority of the two-party preferred vote has been able nevertheless to form a majority government. That was not the first time that it happened, though it should be of some concern that the party with minority support in the community is able to form a government. It is, however, a fact that a New South Wales type outcome is possible where single member constituencies form the basis of electoral representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, however, sees the New South Wales result as being a reflection of voter sentiment to tip out the Fahey government. That only goes to show how out of touch the Prime Minister is. Voter sentiment was clearly for the continuance of a coalition government. The fact that 52 per cent of voters voted for the coalition is evidence enough of the true sentiment of New South Wales voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is important in that it also makes minor technical amendments to the machinery for referendums. This is especially important in light of the present debate over the republic. The aim of the coalition is to involve all the Australian people by consultative and constitutional referenda in any change to our constitutional arrangements. We also intend to use the process of a people's convention to decide the questions and options which will be put before the people in a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Our policy direction, which offers the Australian people a real choice, makes full usage of the referendum mechanism, and is the only prescription which gives the people alternatives. The Prime Minister offers the Australian people only his solitary partisan choice&mdash;the take it or leave it option. The best way to involve all Australians and tap a clear consensus for the final question to be put is to involve as many people as possible and use the referendum mechanism to its best effect. That is why the Australian people believe our option is the best way to go and will best prevent the present Prime Minister dictating a partisan approach to the Australian people, which would be defeated in a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to now draw attention to clause 42 of schedule 1 and clause 8 of schedule 2. These clauses deal with compulsory voting and the issue of penalty notices where an enrolled voter is found not to have exercised his or her right to vote. Both clauses have the same wording, but the former relates to the machinery of the Electoral Act and the latter to the Referendum Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these clauses is to provide the divisional returning officer with the option of delivering the penalty notice by means other than post. This is intended to make delivering penalty notices in the bush easier, because mail deliveries are sometimes unreliable, and will allow the AEC field officers to deliver the notices. This is a very reasonable proposition if you support the concept of compulsory voting&mdash;and we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have made it known on earlier occasions in this place and elsewhere that I favour voluntary voting and thereby believe we should not be passing laws to further entrench compulsion. This is especially the case with penalty notices. In my view, compulsory voting is incompatible with a free and democratic society. An essential component of the right to vote is the right not to vote. To force people to exercise the right to vote contradicts the very nature of that right. This attitude was at the heart of the Dutch parliament's decision&mdash;and other parliaments&mdash;to end compulsory voting in 1970. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that election results should be based on the clear choice of voters voluntarily participating in the process, and should not be influenced by votes cast by those who would not bother to vote if they were not so compelled. Voluntary voting is the norm in nearly all Western nations, with Australia being only one of about four countries to maintain compulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be in a minority does not necessarily mean we are in the wrong, but there must be good reasons to coerce people into fronting up at a polling station on election day. In most Western countries with voluntary voting, voter turnout is still substantial. In fact, since 1945, several nations with voluntary voting have averaged higher voting turnouts than countries with compulsory voting. Unfortunately, a coherent case in favour of compulsory voting has not been made, in my view, neither recently nor in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another electoral issue for which a good case has not been made is the government's call to change the voting system for the Senate. This is a typical example of a Prime Minister with imperial ambitions who, having been thwarted on many occasions by the Senate, now wants to change the rules. The Prime Minister has been totally lacking in balance on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has described those in the other place as `unrepresentative swill'. Why would he do that? There are several reasons, but most notable is his frustration with the Senate. The Senate is more representative of Australia's diverse political opinion and is not controlled by Labor. This prevents the executive being able to dictate federal government policy in all areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wants the Senate to be simply a rubber stamp. His threat to change the system reflects his contempt for this parliament. Not only does he treat the Senate with contempt, this contempt has spread to this House, as witnessed by his infrequent appearances in this place. Our part-time Prime Minister thinks it is an honour that he should grace us twice a week with his appearances at question time. When he does, his behaviour in this place is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Alan Ramsey, on 17 March last year, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> said of the Prime Minister's attitude to the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's essentially a political response by a Prime Minister who is sick and tired of having to deal with the Senate, which he cannot control. Nothing in Paul Keating's political career suggests that he has a real concern about the legislative process of parliament. He sees parliament as political theatre.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) said on the same show:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating has a very conservative, traditionalist view of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not agree with my esteemed colleague in that regard. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He believes that we have an election every three years and that's it. In between, the government should govern unimpeded and that parliament exists simply as a talking shop, of which the government may take notice, or may not, at its discretion.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with those latter sentiments. Mr John Nethercote, a senior researcher in the Senate, got it right when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's philosophy is more akin to that of Bonapartisn, where the idea is, once you've elected the leader, the leader goes and does whatever he or she likes. That is not a tradition of government with which we are familiar.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact remains that the Prime Minister claims the Senate is unrepresentative because each state has 12 senators. This means that to elect a senator in Tasmania it takes one-sixth of the voters, or 27,000, whereas, in New South Wales, it takes 318,000. Yet the response of the Prime Minister is not to advocate a change in the number of senators from each state to reflect one vote, one value, because this requires a constitutional amendment which would never succeed, and rightly so. Instead the Prime Minister talks about eliminating proportional representation in the Senate and replacing it with 12-single member constituencies in each state elected by first past the post. No longer would a senator represent a state, but only part of a state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a change to the Senate electoral system would be good for the major parties because they would have a fifty-fifty chance of gaining control of the Senate. However, the 15.5 per cent of voters who voted for neither the coalition nor Labor would be totally without representation in both houses of parliament. That would be untenable. The Senate, as a house of review, should be made up of a cross-section of the voting public, to be thereby competent in reviewing the legislative and administrative programs of an increasingly dictatorial and out of touch executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's talk of changing the Senate electoral system smacks of the anti-federalist diatribe which so frequently flows from our much and deservedly maligned Prime Minister's mouth. We have seen time and again that Labor has no respect for the federal compact upon which this Federation was originally built. If the rules do not suit the present Prime Minister, he just sets out to change them. He is rather akin to the boy who, frustrated by his lack of performance, takes his bat and ball home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government which, nevertheless, claims to be inclusive. It is actually a government which pays only lip service to social justice. The reality is that it is actually a government which pursues exclusivist policies. This can be clearly seen in the increasing gap between rich and poor and in the gradual but relentless destruction of mainstream Australia. It is no surprise that Labor will never be trusted to have control of both houses of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The earlier speakers in this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill gave some enumeration&mdash;it was all right for one to do it; I do not know why three speakers in this place had to&mdash;of what is in the bill. A lot of what is in the bill is technical streamlining, and it does not seem to me that there is any malice aforethought in what is being proposed. The bill is rather interesting, not for what it has in it but for what it leaves out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help but make one comment about the banning of canvassing in and around hospitals. The ALP has a very well deserved reputation for rigging electoral arrangements so that it wins. In Queensland, the Labor Party's record is rather magnificent. In the redistribution before last, it simply took six country seats that it had&mdash;the AWU seats&mdash;and divided them in half. After the redistribution the electorate that I represented in the state house had 3,500 electors&mdash;it was a very strong ALP area&mdash;and the electorate of the National Party leader, or Country Party leader as he then was, north of Brisbane had 20,000 electors. So one seat had 3,500 electors and the other seat had over 20,000 electors. Yet the same people, some 15 years later, were crying and whingeing about one vote, one value. This is an exercise in arch hypocrisy. There are few examples to rival that particular one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I view with some degree of suspicion the banning of canvassing in and around hospitals. On the face of it, this is quite a reasonable proposition. We do not want sick people being worried by people coming around canvassing and oversighting. I registered my first vote at Mosman Hall in Charters Towers which is the big mental hospital for northern Australia. When I, as a young lad of 18, went into the polling booth, I asked the presiding returning officer how I went about voting, and four members of the nurses union accosted me&mdash;not in the sense that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is giggling about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of them put his arm around me in a rather friendly fashion and informed me that the way I should vote is ALP. He said, `Come over here and I'll give you this ballot paper and I'll show you what to do.' He took me into the polling booth. I represented north-west Queensland in rugby league at the tender age of 17 and I was fairly aggressive in nature. I informed him, in a rather unfriendly manner, that my name was Katter and my father was the National Party candidate. I then informed him that he was in desperate trouble, both physical and otherwise&mdash;and there was a mad scramble for the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst one can view that scene with some degree of humour, that is the way the ALP operates. That incident was the subject of a formal complaint and an investigation at the time, so what I am saying is not just a story conjured up in my imagination. The particular incident I am referring to is on the record in the courts in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also thrown out of the Ingham hospital before the last election by an ALP supporter. I was not speaking to the patients; I was going around speaking to the nurses. One particular nurse made me aware of her political convictions and evicted me from the premises. So when I am told that canvassing in and around hospitals is to be banned I view such a proposal with extreme suspicion. I suspect that the very aggressive nurses union, which is one of the bulwarks upon which the ALP is built in Australia, has been responsible for this little manoeuvre and not the welfare of the sick and those needing to be cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reference by the Minister for Administrative Services, who led this debate, was the removal of gender specific language. Truly, in our day and age, with 14,000 bankruptcies a year&mdash;this is according to the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)&mdash;16 per cent of the Australian work force without a job, the highest suicide rate in the world and the worst current account deficit problems on the entire planet, spending the time of this House and the Public Service eliminating gender specific language really deserves the contempt in which the people of Queensland&mdash;I must say I do not know about other parts of Australia&mdash;hold the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP will be taken to the cleaners in the forthcoming Queensland election like no-one has ever been taken to the cleaners before, except when Bjelke-Petersen took Whitlam there in 1975&mdash;and, by the way, the polls were 62 to 38. This legislation is hallmarked by what is not in there rather than by what is in there. Very important principles of the democracy are being turkey trampled by the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The northern weather systems are completely dominated by monsoonal troughs and cyclones. Almost all of our rain depressions come from those two large systems. So when it rains in one place it really rains right across the board. A monsoonal trough normally extends from Queensland across to Western Australia and down to Lake Eyre. If we get a monsoonal trough or a big cyclonic depression, every single person living outside a town that does not have a polling booth will be eliminated from voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP, in its cleverness, believes that this is very beneficial to it because all the country people will not be able to vote. The ALP is moving to save money not to manipulate the system&mdash;it would never do that. Purely to save money, those opposite closed a whole stack of the smaller polling booths so the people in places like Kynuna, McKinlay, Torrens Creek, et cetera, who vote heavily for the National Party, no longer have a polling booth. If we prevent people from postal voting, we will disenfranchise a very large sector of the National Party voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their monumental stupidity, the ALP introduced one vote, one value in Queensland. As it turned out, that system delivered three votes in the state house to the National Party not to the ALP. The deputy director, not the clever Mr Wayne Swan who engineered it, not that imbecile who looks like losing his seat in the forthcoming election&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. N.B. Reid)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX4">Mr KATTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw that remark unequivocally. This particular gentleman very cleverly thought it would be great to introduce one vote, one value. He made two mistakes. He put a man of some integrity in as the commissioner, which is not a mistake that the ALP usually makes&mdash;very seldom does it put anyone of integrity into any position, but it did in this case. He came up with the verdict that you have to have a way to deliver true democracy, which was not particularly outstanding since the Supreme Court of the United States had decided exactly the same thing. As well, every constitution that has been written down in the history of the planet has been based on a similar decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This august body we call the parliament of Australia remains the only body in the entire planet that has a primitive system wherein each electorate is supposed to have the same population size. Without a system of checks and balances, this was introduced into the United States system as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since both state and federal elections are held around the middle of the wet season for northern Australia, a very large proportion of the entire number of people living outside the towns are disenfranchised because it is impossible for them to get into town to vote. Except for our main roads, we have very few bitumen roads in the big and sparsely populated areas such as Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, with the same sort of stupidity that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) exemplified in introducing the one vote, one value system in Queensland where the ALP lost three seats as a result, those opposite got themselves into trouble as well when they forgot about the black vote, the Aboriginal vote, which very heavily favours them. They disenfranchised very large proportions of their own constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They want to play politics but they have not played it very cleverly on numerous occasions, and that was one of them. Maybe there are principles that ride a little higher than those democratic principles. To have a very large proportion of the entire population's right to vote depend upon the vagaries of the weather is anti-democratic in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in fettlers' camps, miners' camps, mustering camps, isolated Aboriginal communities, and those working on station properties, in shearing sheds and in isolated tourist centres such as Undara and Gunpowder, which are in my electorate, are affected by cyclonic depressions and the monsoonal season and will be disenfranchised unless something is done in relation to postal voting. At present, these people in these places are the only ones in Australia who have to have applications for postal votes sent out to them and then have to send them back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is rather curious because people on station properties and those in fettlers' camps, Aboriginal communities and tourist centres only enjoy a mail service once a fortnight thanks to the generosity of this government which removed their weekly mail service. It takes two weeks to send out the application for a postal vote, it takes two weeks for it to be sent back, it takes another two weeks for the ballot paper to be sent out and then another two weeks for the ballot paper to come back. That is how long it takes if it does not rain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For people who do not live in the big towns&mdash;the government has taken away the polling booths from the small towns&mdash;voting is really a game of Russian roulette. The government has got its just deserts in this regard, but, unfortunately, it is the Australian people who have been deprived. The government has, with its one vote, one value principle, taken away the voice of country people in Australia. This is a primitive, simplistic method which has no checks and balances to offset the undemocratic principles contained in it. It has also made some smart manoeuvres like the one in relation to the postal voting system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why in heaven's name if you are registered as a postal voter on the books of the returning officers of Australia do you have to be sent a postal voting application form? Clearly, if you have registered yourself as a postal voter you do not need an application form. The only conceivable reason for the existence of an application form for postal voting is political chicanery by the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot sit down without going sideways for a few minutes and talking about the principle of no taxation without representation. That is what we now have in the bush. I have been told by the electoral office that the electorate I represent now has over 85,000 electors. My electorate extends from Mareeba north of Cairns down to Barcaldine and Blackall in south Queensland which is almost in line with Brisbane. They are too far north of Brisbane. My electorate extends almost the entire length of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes over 20 hours in a motor car&mdash;and there are nearly 200 kilometres of dirt to travel over&mdash;to travel from Mareeba, which is the second biggest town in the electorate of Kennedy, to Longreach, which is the fifth biggest town in the electorate of Kennedy and the centre of the central west. Even in a light aircraft it would take a good half day to get from Mareeba to Blackall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have said that they do not see me. Of course they do not see me. There are over 100 towns in my electorate and after you take out the parliamentary sitting days each town gets two days of my time. If I leave Charters Towers at 8 o'clock in the morning by the time I get to Canberra it is 5 o'clock in the evening. It takes me a full day to get down here and a full day to get back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members who have comfortable city seats in Sydney can jump in a motor car and a few hours later be home. For members like the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and me two days are added to every sitting of the parliament. This limits the amount of attention that the people in my electorate get&mdash;and this would be the same in the electorate of Maranoa. I find that I spend an average of 46 hours a week travelling. We cannot ring people or answer telephone calls; we cannot do anything. We just have to sit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take a quick flight to Sydney, and then the flight is broken in Sydney. We get into another aeroplane to go to Brisbane. We get out and get into another aeroplane to go to Longreach or Townsville. We get out of that and get into a car to go to Ingham or to Innisfail, or whatever the case may be. Although we all try, there is not enough time to do any meaningful work while we are travelling. We have no driver, so we have to drive ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person who is in a Sydney electorate can get the attention of his member of parliament for a 60-hour week. I think a lot of the members of parliament representing Sydney in the opposition most certainly work a 60-hour week. However, to deliver 60 hours to our constituencies, we have to work 100 hours a week. As a second generation federal parliamentarian&mdash;and the sentiments of the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) on this would be similar to mine&mdash;I know that it is not much fun being brought up without a father, and to deprive people of those values puts the sort of person in parliament that I do not think we really want here. </PARA>

The seat of Nunciak has 22,000 electors. In the Orkney Islands in Great Britain&mdash;another great democracy&mdash;there are 21,000 electors. They return a member of parliament.

The great father of democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville, often spoke about democracy not being the tyranny of the majority. It was a phrase that he used continually in his writings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today we are witnessing the crucifixion of the pastoral sector. One in four farmers has been destroyed since 1986. In Queensland it is most certainly another one in four, or arguably one in three, on top of that. I suspect it is probably the same figure for Australia. We are witnessing the complete collapse of the farming sector in Australia, and it is taking the national economy with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our greatest national assets, the beef herd, has lost 30 per cent of its numbers since the late 1970s and early 1980s. The nation's greatest asset by far and away is our wool herd, and half of our sheep numbers have gone. With the wheat industry, plantings last year were 50 per cent of what they were two years before. People may well say, `That was the drought.' We have had three of those droughts in the last 11 years. Is it the drought? The output of three of our six major exporting items has dropped by half. It is not because of the drought; it is because of the continual persecution of the rural sector by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Queensland pastoral sector goes, there are only two representatives in this place&mdash;the honourable member for Maranoa and me. I represent one-third of the pastoral interests. The mining industry is crashing down around our ears for exactly the same reason as the pastoral industry. There are numerous spokesmen here for the environmental industry, there are numerous spokesmen here for the Aboriginal industry; but there are very few spokesmen here for the mining and pastoral industries. That is why the other two sectors are going ahead in leaps and bounds, while agriculture and mining are falling straight through the floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the four years before this present four-year period, the mining industry had a 25 per cent increase, as it had had for almost all of Australia's history. The pastoral industry had a 13 per cent increase in production in that same period. However, in the last four years, mining has dropped from a 25 per cent increase to a 3.6 per cent increase. The pastoral industry has dropped from a 13 per cent increase down to a 1.9 per cent increase. In real terms, both industries have declined in the last four years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to make a contribution to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995. It is interesting to note the background of this bill, which is largely in response to recommendations the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made on the referendum amendment bills, and particularly our electoral laws. It is interesting to note that the bill has made some welcome changes in the area of electoral enrolment and that the joint standing committee also recommended a change in procedures where an objection has been lodged to the enrolment of a voter. I think it is very important that some of these areas were looked at, and it was probably long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Maranoa, I have a distinct interest in general postal votes in remote areas. I think the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) spoke extremely well on some of the problems associated with not only representing large rural electorates but also people trying to cast their votes in the democratic system that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the security marks on ballot papers, I want to put on the public record some of the changes to the electoral roll as a result of an electoral roll review within my own electorate of Maranoa since the last federal election. I think this relates very much to the security marks and ballot papers issue. We live in the real world where we have got to say that the system that is in place in terms of people's eligibility to vote means that being registered on an electoral roll means, when it comes to identifying whether they have only voted once on that day, there are no security checks; there is no system in place which would prevent someone from voting early and voting often, particularly where perhaps there are people on rolls who should not be on those rolls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 there were 83,523 people on the electoral roll in the division of Maranoa. With absentee votes and postal votes, 80,269 people voted. As a result of the review, which was completed only on 21 June of this year, the electorate now has officially 80,287 electors on the roll. Since the last federal election, 4,300 electors who were on the roll in Maranoa have been removed from the roll. This is as a result of a review that was conducted throughout the whole of Queensland's federal divisions, and in fact probably covered the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that there are 4,300 supposedly eligible voters in Maranoa that have been removed as a result of the review who could not sustain the fact that they still lived in the electorate, that they were alive or had moved to somewhere else in the electorate. The possibility does exist for the voting system to be abused to include some of those votes to be utilised, for whatever political reason. Obviously I do not know, and perhaps none of us would know, who those people were, but it does open up the question as to the sort of system we have in place where in my own electorate of Maranoa 4,300 voters were eligible to vote who were ostensibly on the roll, yet were removed within 12 months of the election as a result of this review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is translated into some of the marginal electorates&mdash;my good friend the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) represents a very marginal seat&mdash;and if this system were used by a political party trying to gain power, it could mean the difference between winning and losing a seat. Let us face it, we live in the real world. It is not a fairy world when it comes to gaining power. We are already seeing some of the dirty tricks that are going to be used by the Labor Party in Queensland in election advertising. In the case of the Page electorate on the north coast of New South Wales, the difference was 70 votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Parkes, whom I mentioned earlier, holds a very marginal seat. You have only to use your imagination to see how these people who are not actually living in the electorate could use the system to gain seats for a particular political party. Perhaps these people are phantom voters, and I suggest that they could also be voting more than once. I think we have to look at the issue of identification because when someone goes to vote today all they have to say is that they have not voted and that they are eligible to vote in a particular electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at this issue in the longer term. In carrying out these reviews we are finding more and more that people are not necessarily remaining in an electorate. Perhaps they have moved to other areas for legitimate reasons. However, leaving them on the roll in a particular electorate could lead to some corruption of the electoral system. It is open to any political party or any independent candidate to use the system in this way. I am not suggesting that it has happened in the past, but it obviously does provide an opportunity for the system to be abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on the issue of postal votes with particular reference to remote areas of this nation.

They would have loved to because they were going to protest at the way that this Labor government has treated people in rural and remote Australia. They were desperate to cast their votes. But, unfortunately, they could not do so because, as the member for Kennedy says, this election, as is often the case, was held during the wet season when the rivers were up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the difficulties that people in remote Australia are confronted with when it comes to casting their vote as it is their democratic right to do. That is why we on this side of the House accept the recommendation to adopt the practice of some of the states and territories where ballot papers are automatically sent to those people who have applied for a postal vote. In the Queensland state election such people will be sent the ballot papers automatically because they are registered on the roll for a postal vote. If a federal election takes place within the next two to three months these people will be expecting to automatically receive the ballot papers because it happens at a state level. Unless amendments are passed in this House, that will not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore urge the Minister for Administrative Services to look at what the other states are doing and, in the interests of fairness and democracy, amend the anomaly that exists today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present rule says that you can become a general postal voter for a remote region if you live more than 20 kilometres from a polling booth. That is very important in my area where we are suffering a recession and a drought, and some people cannot even afford the petrol to drive that distance. But what happens when you become a general postal voter? To recap what others have said: as soon as possible after an election is called you are sent the application form without having to specifically request it, you fill it in, you send it back, then they send you the ballot papers, you receive them&mdash;if the mail gets through&mdash;you fill them in, you send them back and, hopefully, your vote will be recorded. The difficulty is that there are four mailings that have to be foolproof if you are to get your vote in on time: a mail out to your property; a mail back with the application form; a mailing out with a ballot paper; and a mailing back to where the vote is to be collected and counted. This is quite crazy indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read from section 6.43 of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on its inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and related matters, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this poses no problem for electors with regular mail delivery, there are electors in remote areas who are regularly disenfranchised by the current procedures. At present, the period between close of nominations and polling day can be as few as 22 days. In many remote areas of Australia, the turnaround time for mail can be a week or more, meaning that the process of receiving and returning a postal vote application and then receiving and returning ballot papers can take up to a month&mdash;too long, in many cases, for electors in remote areas to have their votes counted.</PARA>
<PARA>Something like 10 submissions to the inquiry mentioned this very point, including ones from electoral commissioners in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Electoral Commission itself, based here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many households in Australia that only receive one mail delivery a week. In fact, I have checked it out and the latest official figure shows that 3,157 households fall into that category. There are, of course, other households that receive a less frequent mail delivery than once per week. The member for Maranoa spoke of that. In my own electorate of Parkes, there are 386 households that receive only one mail delivery a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is the solution to all of this? It is very simple indeed: to bring the federal act into line with what exists in the other states and territories. In New South Wales, in Queensland, in South Australia, in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory, if you are a registered postal voter more than 20 kilometre distant from a polling booth, as soon as practical after the writs are issued you are sent the ballot papers. That is, you are automatically sent the papers when an election is called. That removes two steps&mdash;two mailings. It means that, even if you live in a remote area where mailings are infrequent, you still get the chance to vote, which is surely what this country, with its fine democratic system, should be all about. If we did this, it would not only remove those two steps but bring in a uniform procedure right across Australia, at both state and federal level. It would also eliminate confusion, particularly when a state and a federal election are held in the same area in the same year, as is likely to happen in Queensland this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is already a precedent for this federally. People who are infirm and who are unable to sign documents can  register as general postal voters and, when the writs are issued, they are automatically sent their ballot papers as soon it is possible to do so. So, if that happens now for infirm people who are unable to sign documents, why can it not be extended to people living in remote areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read a letter I received from Paul Dacey, who is the Assistant Commissioner for Development and Research at the Australian Electoral Commission. It is dated 17 October 1994, and he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission advises there are currently some 584 registered physically incapacitated electors who are automatically issued with ballot papers for federal elections.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is approximately a 100 per cent response rate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is from these people, when they vote. He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has never been any evidence of fraudulent activity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is worth repeating: `there has never been any evidence of fraudulent activity'. So the precedent is set. It is done in the states. It is done federally for this category of people. Why can it not be extended to this other category?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the latest figures that I have, there are 9,623 general postal voters who live more than 20 kilometres from a polling booth, of whom 6,195 are in Queensland. The figures for the remaining states are 1,075 in New South Wales, 879 in South Australia, 826 in Western Australia, 480 in the Northern Territory, 92 in Victoria and 76 in Tasmania. Those 9,623 people are less than one-tenth of one per cent of Australia's voters. Why is there a section of this small group who are continually disenfranchised? The government has a simple solution and is doing nothing about it. The mind boggles as to why they will not act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are concerns as to the integrity of that solution, it is also worth noting what the Australian Electoral Commission says. I quote again from the letter of Paul Dacey, who wrote to the electoral matters committee. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considers that the checking procedure would essentially be the same as for any other postal vote, except that the signature of the voter on the postal vote certificate would be checked against the Application for Registration as a GPV, rather than the Application for a Postal Vote. This is the system used in those States which despatch ballot papers direct to the GPVs. In order to ensure that all GPVS addresses are maintained as up to date as possible, a review of the Register of GPVs would be undertaken regularly, probably at the same time as an Electoral Roll Review, i.e., at least every eighteen months.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes further comments about the integrity of the system. There is no doubt that this would be a very secure system to put in place. I contacted Paul Dacey directly, and in his reply of 11 October 1994, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no recorded evidence of either fraudulent activity or malpractice resulting from the automatic issue of ballot papers to register general postal voters.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about the situation that exists in every state in Australia which has implemented the decision that should be in operation at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to quote from Brian Cox, who is the Australian Electoral Commissioner, the highest person in the land on this subject, who sent an additional submission to the committee last year. It is dated 7 October 1994 and it says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Distance of residence from a polling place is a relevant factor in determining whether an elector should be eligible to become a registered general postal voter, in that electors in remote areas should not be inconvenienced in voting by having to travel an unreasonable distance to cast their vote. This is recognised in Section 184(A)(2)(a) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act), in its allowing registration as general postal voters to those electors who reside more than 20 kilometres from a polling place or mobile polling station. However the issue with regard to automatic provision of ballot papers to general postal voters in remote areas is solely whether their mail service is frequent and dependable enough to ensure despatch and return within the timeframes specified in the Act, of the two sequential sets of electoral papers currently necessary to cast a postal vote.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be plainer than that. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence from the Northern Territory strongly supports the proposition that the distance of the elector's residence from a polling place or mobile polling station is not a relevant factor in an elector's access to sufficiently frequent and dependable mail services. Of the electors currently registered as general postal voters in the Northern Territory, around 77 per cent are enrolled for residences within 100 kilometres of the nearest polling place or mobile polling station, yet receive only a weekly or less frequent mail service. It is most likely that a large proportion of these electors would continue to be adversely affected if the proposal under consideration were to be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a very plain statement from the Electoral Commissioner. He further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission would also reiterate its argument contained in paragraph 8.3.2 of its "Submission on the Conduct of the 1993 General Election" of 3 August 1993 that: "the situation is exacerbated if electors are working (eg mustering) during this election period and miss the consignment of mail in their weekly service". Again the relevant issue is the frequency of the mail service to the elector, rather than the location of the residence in relation to the nearest polling place.</PARA>
<PARA>He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imposition of an arbitrary 100 kilometre distance of residence from a polling place as the determining factor in whether registered general postal voters in remote areas automatically receive ballot papers would also be likely to add to elector confusion between federal and State voting procedures. No State or Territory legislation includes any similar provision.</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the submission he makes another very telling statement that is worth recording:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee might also consider extending the automatic issue of ballot papers to all registered general postal voters, not only to those in remote areas. The Commission would support such a proposal as it would assist in providing an improved level of service to all registered general postal voters and remove, in the majority of States, possible voter confusion caused by different federal and State electoral procedures. From an administrative viewpoint, there would no longer be the need for the current double-handling process of issuing a postal vote application followed by a postal vote certificate when the required declarations have already been made in applying for general postal voter status. The adoption of such a proposal would also achieve estimated savings of around $40,000 in the overall cost of an election.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, would like to save the taxpayers of Australia $40,000, the Australian Electoral Commissioner has documented a simple solution whereby the system in Australia can be uniform and simple while maintaining its great integrity. </PARA>

<PARA>That is all that needs to be inserted in the act. It is very simple indeed. It works in every other state perfectly well and it should be working here federally. As the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) said, the minister at the table should take up the suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time remaining to me I would just like to mention three or four other things briefly. The minimum election period in this country at present stands at 33 days, and the Australian Labor Party in its submission this year said that this should be reduced by nine days to 24 days. Of course, the Australian Electoral Commission picked up immediately what the Labor Party was up to when it put in that submission, and commented that if this were implemented many postal voters would be disenfranchised, especially overseas postal voters and remote postal voters. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government members on this committee also recommended that prisoners be extended the vote.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that was raised earlier by the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) was that of electoral employees over the age of 65 not being allowed to work at polling booths in future. That is a ridiculous proposal. It has occurred because the Australian Electoral Commission received advice from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that it cannot employ persons who are 65 years of age or over because they will not be covered by the Commonwealth Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, I want to make some brief comments about multiple voting. This is often raised by people who are concerned about the integrity of the electoral system. The extent of multiple voting in Australia, as far as we can detect, is quite low. In 1990&mdash;these are the latest figures I have seen&mdash;there were 377 people in Australia who voted more than once. If you divide that by the 148 electorates that existed at that time, that is about 2 1/2 people in each electorate on average. Nearly all the people who multiple vote only multiple vote twice&mdash;not six or 10, let alone 50 or 100, times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that for the 1993 election in New South Wales, where there are 50 federal electorates, the most multiple votes in any one electorate were in the electorate of Sydney, where 15 people voted more than once. In my own electorate of Parkes, there were only three. These were the people who admitted to multiple voting. The real figure may be somewhat higher than that. However, there is a fail-safe mechanism in place that ensures that multiple voting cannot mean that a person who received a minority of legal votes was elected, because if there are more multiple votes than there is a winning margin, then the election in that electorate is automatically declared null and void, and the election is held again. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to join with other members in participating in this debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995. As has been said previously, this bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and also the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The bill responds partly to a report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The report of inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election and matters related thereto.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very wise that in Australia following every federal election we do have a committee representing all sides of politics which considers the poll and any problems which arose, and makes recommendations for future elections so that any anomalies or any things that have gone wrong can be corrected. But, as so often happens with reports from the parliament, there was a majority report&mdash;and the majority is controlled by the Australian Labor Party&mdash;and there was a minority report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with a very large number of matters and, as has been indicated by prior opposition speakers, the coalition does not oppose the many amendments to the bill, as most of them are non-controversial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are 86 in all. The government constantly brings in bills to amend acts of parliament. It is a pity that the government does not consider more thoroughly what ought to be the law before bringing bills into this place. Then we would not be in the situation of having to amend and re-amend legislation time after time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, most of these 86 amendments are non-controversial. Some of them are being politically correct. For instance, gender specific language is being removed. I think that it is fairly tragic that the time of the parliament is taken up so often with such relatively minor matters. We also notice that the parliament is even being asked to remove the hyphen from words such as de-registered, de-registration, de-registering and de-register, wherever occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But among the major provisions of the bill are those designed to ensure that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes. While the legislation currently provides that the address of a silent enrolment voter be removed from the postal vote application before being made available for inspection, there is other information such as phone number, postal address and witness's name and address on the application, all of which could help identify the elector's address and particulars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to improve the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends of electors of unsound mind who do not live in the same subdivision as those electors to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee. Section 118(4) of the Electoral Act provides that such an objection must be accompanied by a certificate issued by a medical practitioner which states that in the practitioner's opinion the elector is of unsound mind and cannot understand the nature and significance of enrolment and voting. Under the act, a challenged elector may answer an objection. The bill also seeks to allow for electors whose enrolment has been objected to to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of rolls. This will help to ensure that only electors entitled to vote are in fact able to vote on polling day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also seek to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use a more up-to-date method of scrutiny printing of ballot papers for referenda and elections, instead of using watermarked ballot papers, which will result in considerable savings in ballot paper storage and production costs. Obviously the coalition does not oppose this, as indeed we do not oppose many other amendments being suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to disallow canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day. Special hospitals are hospitals declared by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> as covered by section 225 of the act, and they include convalescent homes and similar institutions. Perhaps the government ought to consider issuing a clarification on just what is indeed the polling place. Is it the entire hospital, is it the grounds in which the hospital is situated, or is it indeed the hall or the part of the hospital where the voting actually takes place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases we have hospitals, we have hostels, we have nursing homes and we have independent retirement units all in the same complex. There have been some questions raised as to whether candidates are able to enter other parts of the premises, other than what we would all consider to be the polling place. I must say that obviously it is not the intention of the government or indeed the act to prevent electors in their homes from being canvassed for votes. But I think that the government ought to clarify what it means by a polling place and what is a definition of a hospital as there has been some ambiguity and some angst caused at election time because we have had varying interpretations decided at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill quite sensibly seeks to extend the right to vote in elections to all divisional returning officers and Australian electoral officers and standardise the method of resolving ties during the counting of votes. I think that this is a sensible proposal which is designed to recognise that electoral officers are indeed members of the community, are indeed voters and that they have the same interests as do other people in the community in the outcome of an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to extend the two-candidate preferred count as conducted in polling places on polling night to the fresh scrutiny and declaration vote scrutinies as conducted later by the divisional returning officers. A two-candidate preferred count will be applied to declaration vote scrutinies in all electorates. In the 1993 election the two-candidate preferred count was applied to scrutiny of the declaration vote only in those electorates that were identified as close at the end of counting on election night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also goes on to ensure that posters and car stickers are included in those forms of advertising which require authorisation. Whilst I must say that many people who see cars drive by would not have the quality of eyesight necessary to identify an authorisation on a car sticker on a moving motor vehicle, my understanding is that the government has said that car stickers are often placed on items other than motor vehicles and that therefore it would be wise to include the authorisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to provide that letters to an editor of a newspaper are exempt from the full requirements of the authorisation provisions in elections and referenda. Only the author's name and suburb or locality are to be shown. This amendment is made to address the security and privacy problems which currently exist as a result of the requirement for full address details to be shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to abolish the obligation for the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise in two newspapers in a state or territory the receipt and particulars of the writ for the election of members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or for a referendum, as well as notices relating to redistributions and mini-redistributions. Following the bill becoming law, if indeed it does, it is proposed that such notices be published in only one newspaper in a state or territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been foreshadowed that the coalition will, in another place, move a number of amendments to this particular legislation and my colleagues, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Parkes, have made clear their concern over the situation concerning the position of general postal voters. The honourable member for Parkes has pointed out that only a very small number of voters in Australia are included in this category. And as I interjected, I saw the minister nodding in an optimistic way at the comments made by the honourable member for Parkes. I think that in the interest of equity and fairness the government ought to pick up this proposed amendment and from the minister's positive response one would hope that indeed this has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that in a democracy it is totally unacceptable that people should be denied the opportunity of having their vote counted simply because of bureaucracy or simply because of infrequent mail services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been indicated that the coalition will move to end age discrimination against Australian Electoral Commission employees over the age of 65. I think this is an appropriate course of action on a couple of accounts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would claim to be strong in supporting people of ethnic origin. It also claims to have a good record in relation to gender equity, although that record is open to question. But by not having indicated at this stage that it will accept our amendments, the government is taking an ageist approach to those Australians over the age of 65. The government is saying, `If you are over the age of 65, we are going to throw you on the scrap heap. We do not think that you are fit to cross off names on an electoral roll at election time.' If the government dissents from what I am saying, it has the capacity to accept this very sensible amendment. I do not think that the amendment will disadvantage anyone, but it will benefit Australians who in their working lives have helped to make this country the very great society that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will move an amendment allowing political parties, and members and senators, access to the gender of electors. We will also seek to amend the provision where the government is imposing a requirement for an advertisement only in one newspaper, because in those areas where there are two newspapers, people do not necessarily always buy two. People who are in a major centre of population that has two newspapers ought to have easy and prompt access to the information sought to be disseminated by the government through advertisements being placed in both newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the health of any democracy, no matter what its title or status, depends on a small technical detail&mdash;the conduct of elections&mdash;and that everything else is secondary. It ought to be recognised that Australia is one of the world's oldest democracies and those who seek to tear down our constitution really ought to pause for a moment and consider how fortunate we are as a nation to have the freedom, stability and way of life, and the right to elect or throw out a government, which in many parts of the world could only be a dream. However, it is an indictment that the government has not sought, at this stage, to pick up the amendments of the minority of members who helped to contribute to the report on the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters which really ought to have been picked up by the government. It has been indicated that there is not a lot of evidence of fraud at election time. The member for Parkes has pointed out that there is not a large number of multiple voters. But why would anyone bother to be a multiple voter when the electoral system in this country simply depends on honour? It depends on people doing the right thing. What we really ought to do is to have a situation where people are required to prove an entitlement to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, anyone who is 18, who is an Australian citizen and who has lived at his or her present address for at least one month is entitled&mdash;and, in fact, required&mdash;to enrol to vote. No proof of identity, citizenship or residence is required. Come polling day, at the polling booth, the enrollee is only asked whether he or she has voted before for that election. On being told that the person has not voted, the Electoral Commission marks the person's name off. No proof of identity is required and there are very few checks in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly, the Electoral Commission does, from time to time, do the best it can. It compares enrolment applications against ranges of valid street numbers held on the roll management system. Once every three years, it conducts habitation surveys. But, I repeat, there are no checks on citizenship and age. Following an election, it has an electronic scanning of voter lists to detect multiple voting. I understand that the Electoral Commission does compile lists of those people reported as having died and delete these people from the roll. But we have a situation where any number of nom de plumes could be used to fill in a multiplicity of voting cards. The envelope given to people by the Electoral Commission could be used to send those voting cards off to the electoral office. The person might not exist, the address might not exist, and it would take until the next habitation survey for the commission to determine whether those persons should or should not stay on the roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be borne in mind&mdash;as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, would appreciate since you hold a marginal seat&mdash;that the last election was determined by about 1,000 to 1,200 votes in a very small number of electorates right across the country. It is incumbent on us, as members of parliament, to ensure that the result of an election, as declared, is indeed the collective will of the Australian people as determined on polling day. But, unfortunately, because we have this honour system&mdash;which basically says to people, `Please only enrol if you are entitled to,' but which has no real checks and balances&mdash;it would be very easy for any ill-intentioned person or party to manipulate the electoral result by putting a large number of noms de plumes, non-existent persons, on the electoral roll in key marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to have a very fertile imagination to know that, if these seats were well targeted and well chosen, the election result could be changed and the government of the country might not be the government which the people of Australia voted for on polling day. That is a major problem. It is a problem which the majority of members of the committee did not seem to think was a difficulty, but it is a problem which was highlighted by the coalition members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that the government in office or, indeed, a future government, will address this very major problem. We have to emphasise that, as people who believe in a democracy, we ought to support the principle that on polling day the government that is declared to be elected is indeed the government which the people of Australia want. While it is great to have an honour system, while it is great to assume that everyone in Australia is honourable, honest and decent, it is inadequate to have a situation where one party or the other could have the election result stolen from it through electoral fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been suggested that subdivisional voting ought to be reintroduced. We had subdivisional voting in Australia until 1984. The government abolished subdivisional voting for no real reason. The abolition of subdivisional voting meant that people who were enrolled on a divisional roll could vote at any one of 40, 50 or 60 polling booths within that division, whether or not they were voting within the subdivision where they currently resided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In country electorates in particular, the electoral staff at the polling booths often knew many of the residents, but the abolition of subdivisional voting meant that people could roll up to any number of polling booths and vote, not necessarily in their own name but, if they were involved in electoral fraud, through the placing of noms de plume on the electoral roll, then they could go to 40, 50 or 60 polling booths and vote that number of times in different names&mdash;names which ought not to have been placed on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infamous section 245 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act deals with compulsory voting. I believe very strongly that in a democracy people have the right to vote. I would certainly defend anyone's right to vote. It could even be argued that people ought to be compelled to enrol to vote but, when it comes to an election, people in a democracy ought to have the right to vote for one party, or they ought to have the right to vote for another party, or indeed they ought to have the right to abstain from voting altogether if they consider that no particular party is worthy of their support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that the government has chosen at this stage not to look at voluntary voting. One ought to appreciate that Australia is one of the very few countries where compulsory voting is the order of the day. Until 1924, we had voluntary voting in Australia. It is a matter which I, as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia, believe is very important. I believe that it is absolutely vital. </PARA>

As I said at the outset, we are not opposed to most of the amendments being suggested by the government. However, we are sorry that the government has not gone as far as it could have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will be as brief as possible in conclusion. I thank all the members who took part in the debate for their contributions, most of which were thoughtful. The member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who led the debate for the coalition, voiced some slight concerns, if I could put it that way. The theme of all the speeches of coalition members concerned general postal votes. As the coalition knows, or should know, there are two electoral bills: the first is the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill and the second will be introduced by me next week. That second bill will take up most of the recommendations in the 1993 report which have not been addressed in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was introduced in the hope that we might get some important structural changes through without obstructions in the Senate. I hope this bill is passed so that the important changes will be in place at the next election. The second bill, which will be introduced next week, takes up the proposition about general postal votes, and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters agrees with that. There is no dispute about that. As I understand it, there never has been any dispute about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bradfield had a few other concerns. He was worried that you might not be able to read authorisation on car stickers. I always understood that the purpose of authorisation was to prosecute offenders, not to read the name of the authoriser. In any case, authorisation will be on this sort of material in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is concerned about the non-delivery of penalty notices. These are very difficult practical problems associated with the post generally around the country. In some places it is absolutely necessary to deliver things by hand. That is a reality which, whether we like it or not, has to be faced by the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition apparently wants to move a motion enabling elections to be advertised in two national newspapers as opposed to one. We think that is a waste of money. That is why we are going down to one. Obviously, the newspapers have been lobbying about this. There is not any great deal of money involved in it; it is a small sum of money around the country. But, apparently, it is important to some newspapers that they get the advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Age discrimination has been raised. It has nothing to do with election law or the bill. The Australian Electoral Commission is an independent body. It is not subject to the direction or control of me as minister or the government. It is independent. It has made a decision based on legal advice that it has received; that is, if it employs people over the age of 65 years who are not subject to workers compensation of the federal sort, then it is in serious difficulty. That advice is absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the problem lies not with the Electoral Commission, which should not be abused by the opposition in this regard; the problem lies with the federal act that does not give compensation to people in this regard. It is a matter not for this particular portfolio but for another portfolio. I understand a review of this problem is being dealt with. It really is wrong to criticise the Australian Electoral Commission in this regard. A lot of people in my electorate are complaining about not being able to work on polling booths, and I understand their problem. But, as I said, it is wrong to be critical of the Electoral Commission in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) had a lot to say. His contribution ranged from the results of the New South Wales election to the republic and the opposition's lack of policy in that regard. He and various other speakers, including the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), were concerned about compulsory voting. The big issue, as they saw it, was that we should abolish compulsory voting in this country. I know there is a group of people within the coalition parties that are probably closely aligned with organisations such as the League of Rights and that are campaigning actively against compulsory voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin has been very active in this regard. But I remind the House that when Senator Minchin came out demanding the abolition of compulsory voting he was very quickly brought to heel by his leader, who pointed out to the people of Australia that Senator Minchin, the honourable members for Parkes, Maranoa and Kennedy and others are certainly not speaking for the coalition when they make these calls. That is not the policy of the coalition. It is certainly a very unAustralian policy. We have had an excellent system for many years, and the government has no intention of changing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who would listen to this nonsense about non-compulsory voting ought to read&mdash;I recommend them to it&mdash;a wonderful Electoral Commission publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The people's say</EMPHASIS>, which has recently been launched. In it is the case for compulsory voting brilliantly put, if I might say so, by a Mr Chris Puplick, who sets out in great detail why compulsory voting is absolutely essential. I recommend that all members of the opposition read what Chris Puplick has to say about that, absorb the truths he has enunciated in this publication, listen to their leader, stop raising these furphies and stop associating, I might add, as Senator Minchin did, with the League of Rights. He stood up on a public platform and joined with those ultra-fascist, Nazi-like people in trying to bring down our democratic system. Compulsory voting is one of the key elements of democracy in this country and it should stay that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin had a lot to say about democracy in the Senate. I thought he disproved his own case when he pointed out that 27,000 Tasmanians can elect a senator while it takes 318,000 New South Welsh persons to elect a  senator&mdash;a difference of six to one. I think that answers the question about democracy in the Senate. It certainly is an unrepresentative chamber, its constitution lacking in the essential principles of democracy. There are no present proposals to reform it, but there are a lot of people, certainly within my party, that would like to see it reformed to be a more democratic chamber. Perhaps if it were more democratically elected it might actually deal with a bit of legislation occasionally so that we would not be having these huge logjams that are currently developing in this place. In any event, the fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Curtin has disproved his own case in that regard. I thank the coalition for supporting the various provisions here and I look forward to debating the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2). </PARA>

Without debating the merits of the argument about compulsory voting, which I have only touched upon, let me say that to draw that conclusion is wrong. There can be nothing inferred from my position on compulsory voting or voluntary voting which associates me with the League of Rights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to implement some of the recommendations made in the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. On 17 August 1993, I announced in the context of the 1993-94 budget that my department, the Department of Finance and HREOC would jointly conduct a review of the role and functions and the efficiency and effectiveness of HREOC. It was appropriate to have such a review as the workload of HREOC had broadened since its establishment in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An initial report was finalised so that the need for legislative amendment could be considered prior to the appointment of a new human rights commissioner. The review is examining the appropriate role and function of HREOC and addresses the appropriate structure and operating arrangements for the commission and commissioners in the future, taking into account the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission's performance of its work to date and the performance of the commission to date in relation to financial and resource management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial report examined and made recommendations on resource utilisation, corporate performance and the structure of HREOC. The supplementary report which is still in preparation will deal with three key interrelated issues of cooperative arrangements, complaint handling procedures and possible consolidation of the legislation into one act, including plain English drafting. The supplementary report will also contain a new enforcement mechanism for HREOC determinations following the High Court's decision in Brandy v. HREOC. The initial report recognised HREOC's unique role and structure and made a number of recommendations bringing into line various functions of the commission. These have been accepted and given full effect to in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments to the HREOC Act provide that the responsibility for the management of the commission is vested in the commission as a body corporate with chief executive officer powers to be delegated by it to an executive director appointed by the commission under the Public Service Act. This means that all the powers of a secretary under the Public Service Act will be removed from the human rights commissioner and settled upon the president and commissioners collectively.I would like to emphasise the importance of this first step in enhancing the commission's structure to enable the commission to properly assume responsibility for corporate functions and to encourage commissioners to act in a collegiate manner in the spirit of promoting the indivisibility and universality of all human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends subsection 19(3) of the HREOC Act. This will allow the President of the commission to delegate, all or any of his powers under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 or the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 to a member of the commission or a person who holds an appointment under subsection 24F(l) of the Racial Discrimination Act, subsection 57A(l) of the Sex Discrimination Act or subsection 77(l) of the Disability Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Privacy Act 1988. These were necessitated by the decision of the High Court on 23 February 1995 in Brandy v. HREOC. In its decision the High Court ruled constitutionally invalid the enforcement mechanism in place since early 1993 for determinations of discrimination made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This decision affected all determinations made by the commission since 1993 other than those where the respondent was a Commonwealth agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism for the enforcement of determinations made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988 is similar to that used in the Racial Discrimination Act and, hence, is also invalid on the basis of the High Court's decision. The regime which was ruled invalid was incorporated into the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and the Privacy Act in 1993. As a consequence of the High Court's decision, there is currently no way of enforcing the determinations of the commission. I must emphasise that determinations which were made before the invalidated regime commenced are unaffected by the decision as are determinations in which a Commonwealth agency was the respondent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the victims of discrimination are assured of continued protection, the government has acted swiftly to secure the authority and credibility of the commission. The amendments will reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of determinations made by the Commission which operated prior to the enactment of the invalidated scheme. This reinstated scheme will operate as an interim measure, pending the development of a new mechanism to determine complaints of discrimination that meets the constitutional constraints and is as affordable, accessible and effective as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review which has been examining the operations of the commission for sometime has been expanded in membership and asked to develop options for the enforcement of the commission's determinations. The report resulting from this review is due shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not thousands of cases affected by the High Court's decision as has been reported. The vast majority of complaints made to the commission are resolved by conciliation, and the commission has advised the government that only some 37 matters have proceeded to a determination in favour of the complainant since the invalid enforcement process took effect in early 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to these matters, the amendments make provision for complainants or HREOC to seek a rehearing in the Federal Court to obtain an enforceable determination. Respondents can also seek a review of that determination by the Federal Court if they are not happy with the outcome. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was fascinated by the second reading speech given by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in this matter. I wondered how the government would hide its embarrassment over the real reason for this Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. Therefore, it was interesting to note that the second reading speech started off by suggesting that, really, the principal purpose in relation to this matter was to implement recommendations arising from the initial report of the joint review into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Then, almost as an afterthought, it was mentioned that the legislation contains amendments dealing with the matters arising out of the Brandy decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal matter that we are dealing with really is the correction of a major blunder made by the government because it desired to structure legislation in a particular form. I think the decision of the High Court in Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has clearly demonstrated that the government misunderstood&mdash;and that would be putting it generously&mdash;the nature of the body that we are looking at and the way in which it should function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in 1992-93 the government made amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Discrimination Act as well as the Privacy Act to streamline the enforcement of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations. As a result of the Brandy decision, the procedures that were put in place are constitutionally invalid on the basis that the amendments vested judicial power in a non-judicial body&mdash;namely, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This is contrary to chapter III of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review committee, already examining the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's procedures, has been asked by the government to consider valid enforcement options and to report to the government in three months. These amendments are to provide an interim solution by reverting to the cumbersome pre-1992 procedures&mdash;that is, the government saw them to be cumbersome. They will also facilitate the Federal Court determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission determinations made under the invalid procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments amend each of the relative acts to return to the pre-1992 scheme. They provide that, if a respondent does not comply with a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, an action can be brought in the Federal Court. The Federal Court must hear the matter by way of a complete rehearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also relate to determinations made during the period of the operation of the unconstitutional procedures. They provide that parties to such determinations may recommence proceedings in the Federal Court. Again, such hearings are by way of complete rehearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties to Federal Court proceedings, both in respect of future and past determinations, may apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance. The amendments contain an additional miscellaneous amendment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 relating to the delegation of the president's power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, internal reviews of decisions are conducted by the president of the commission, and the workload is proving excessive for a part-time presidential appointment. The amendment would permit internal reviews to be conducted by other commissioners or one of the part-time hearing commissioners which are appointed. These part-time commissioners will come from the ranks of retired Queen's Counsels, judges and academics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments provide an interim solution and, in that sense, are not objectionable per se. Given, however, that the government has long been forewarned of the likely invalidity of this scheme, it must be asked why consideration of a more permanent solution was not undertaken earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was invariably cooperative in relation to these matters and did not directly oppose the legislative amendments brought forward by the government. These are very sensitive areas. Every time we raise objections, we are characterised in ways which I think are often unkind. People use derisive terms to describe those who raise objections to these matters. You are characterised as being racist or sexist if you oppose or raise concerns about legislation in this area. A great deal of sensitivity is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to give any credence to the view that we have any other agenda on these matters, so invariably we try to be cooperative, but we did raise concerns at that time about the potential constitutional uncertainty. A number of my colleagues who have been shadow Attorney-General did so. I think it is appropriate to look at what some of them had to say. In 1992, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), when he was the shadow Attorney-General, said this in a debate relating to this matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have no enforceable orders in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because of the separation of the judicial and non-judicial power. Whether this proposal gets around it is an open question. I foreshadow that there will be an open argument at one point on the constitutionality of that provision. If it is unconstitutional, the Opposition will not support it but, until it is declared to be unconstitutional, we will assume it is valid and we will support it.</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1993 amendments which applied the mechanism to determinations under the Privacy Act&mdash;which similarly were not opposed&mdash;our distinguished colleague and former shadow Attorney-General, the member for Tangney, Mr Daryl Williams QC, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these provisions . . . may fall foul of the constitution with respect to the separation of judicial and non-judicial power. However, the opposition recognises that these procedures provide a more straightforward method of enforcement and review than those presently contained in the Privacy Act. Consistent with its position with respect to the other legislation mentioned, the opposition will not oppose these measures.</PARA>
<PARA>Although we did not oppose the government's measures, we certainly gave the government a very clear warning that our expectation was that there were potential difficulties with the provisions that the government had brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters were also dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Senators Vanstone&mdash;now the shadow Attorney-General&mdash;Kemp and O'Chee dissented from the majority recommendation that was ultimately taken up by the government. My colleagues then recommended that, where conciliation was unsuccessful in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the matter should be referred directly to the Federal Court rather than allowing the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to make an unenforceable determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The likely invalidity of the procedures has also been raised by legal commentators. As noted by A.J.H. Morris QC in an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> in March 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking [the] risk [that the legislation is valid], the Government is gambling with the money and emotional well-being of those citizens most deserving of its protection: namely the innocent victims of unlawful discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention.</PARA>
<PARA>Even after the legislation had been passed, the government was being warned by distinguished commentators that it was on a difficult path. So it is surprising that, in this sensitive area where there are so many determinations and where the Attorney-General has tried to suggest that there are limitations on the potential number of cases involved, there are individuals who had important claims who have been affected as a result of this decision. The situation is that those matters will have to be put right as a result of the amendments that are now being instituted through this bill and the new procedures that are being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brandy decision does raise the question of the quality of the government's constitutional advice. The government's Chief General Counsel, Dennis Rose, had provided advice that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission mechanism proposed here was constitutional and, obviously, we now know that it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brandy is but one in a series of cases in which the High Court has ruled that this Labor government's legislation is unconstitutional. While I do not have an exhaustive list of Labor legislation that has been found unconstitutional, it is particularly germane to note that we have seen it in the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, the Migration Amendment Act 1987, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Corporations Act 1989 and the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is clear from the government's record on these matters that either the government is going to have to address the quality of its advice or, if the advice is always sound and the government is acting without the benefit of its advisers' views, the government should be held more directly accountable in these matters. It may be that in the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act that the government had been counselled against trying to interfere with freedom of speech and that it was a political agenda that was being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the fact is that we have this very poor record. This case raises it again. I noticed that the Attorney-General, who left when I tried to put these matters in context, feels very sensitive about it, and well he should. The Attorney-General is one of the ministers who have special responsibilities not only as parliamentarians but as office holders. It is a significant matter, when there is important legislation in the area that directly reflects upon him, that there is this clear and abundant evidence that the legislation is being found unconstitutional. It is a very significant matter and it cannot be allowed to pass without comment. Having commented, let me make it clear that, in going back to the pre-1992 position, we will not be opposing this bill, but we will continue to draw attention to the difficulties the government faces with the amendments that it proposed previously that were found so wanting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You take very little seriously. What I am explaining to the House is that this issue involves changes in not only laws but also attitudes and approaches of people. It involves a cultural transformation. We need to look at ways in which we can change the culture of people who still wish to discriminate against other persons on the basis of race, colour, descent or national ethnic origin. It is worth looking at the definition of racial discrimination in the act. The act describes racial discrimination as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . discrimination, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important definition, because it contains certain key elements, such as the notion that rights extend beyond just political rights to also cover economic, social and cultural rights. This means that, in relation to those rights, people have the right to be treated equally irrespective of their background, culture, race or colour. Given that aspect of the matter, this is obviously a very important bill because it now seeks to reinforce the human rights legislation, which, unfortunately, was watered down&mdash;or, at least, potentially watered down&mdash;as a result of the High Court's ruling in Brandy v. HREOC earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we as a nation have strong anti-discrimination legislation and strong human rights legislation for a number of reasons. In terms of our international reputation, we are a nation which is proud of the leadership it takes in democratic ideals. The notion of fundamental human rights is central to democratic ideals. We cannot have a situation in which we claim to be a democracy and believe in democracy without reinforcing those democratic ideals, including those fundamental human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If something happens, such as a court case or anything else, which may lead to a watering down or a potential watering down of the intentions of the government in relation to these anti-discrimination laws, the government must act to reinforce the laws and its intentions in relation to discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the honourable member for Berowra tried to make something of this. We in the government are not in the business of trying to pretend that there are no problems in society. The consultations to which I referred detected that, while progress has been made in this nation and we have become a much more tolerant and understanding nation, there are still situations of discrimination. Therefore, it is incumbent on us as a nation and as a government to deal with these issues. Rather than pretending that the problem does not exist, or that we live in some sort of utopia rather than in a situation in which there are still continuing problems we have to face, we are honest about recognising those problems and tackling them. This is also true in the case of racial discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor governments have been at the forefront on this issue. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was introduced by the Whitlam Labor government. It was considered a revolutionary act. It was one of the few acts of its kind internationally. It has had a very significant impact because it has paved the way for Australia to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That act has reinforced our policy of multiculturalism, especially in terms of its contribution to educating our people about the need for tolerance and the need for the understanding of people of different races and different cultures. That greater awareness and tolerance have been reflected in the development of multiculturalism as a philosophy and a social policy in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As everyone knows, this year Australia hosted the major United Nations conference on global diversity. In a sense, it was a celebration of Australia's achievements in this area. In many ways, we have become a model for many other countries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are systematically trying to identify areas where discrimination may exist either directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally. We have been able to pick up areas where there may be disadvantages for particular groups of ethnic people or for particular groups of Aboriginal people and target programs to assist those groups. We are working on programs in the areas of employment, housing, health, aged care, education and law reform&mdash;a whole range of areas where we are taking very seriously the importance of reinforcing egalitarian principles. This legislation is a cornerstone to our continuing to achieve those results. Without legislation such as this, we would not be in a position to continue to achieve those aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition generally have such an ambivalent attitude and have had such an ambivalent attitude over the years to the key policies involved&mdash;human rights and the support of a multicultural agenda. Over the years we have seen huge fights within the opposition parties about their position on these policies. Only this week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was praising Australia for being such a tolerant society when dealing with the Yugoslav crisis, for example. In 1988 he said that multiculturalism was a highly divisive policy and should be abandoned. That is only one example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is on the record many times calling for either a re-evaluation or an overthrow of the policy of multiculturalism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the latest example. Currently we have a situation in which the Racial Hatred Bill, which has passed through this House, is now not being considered in the Senate. That bill, which seeks to protect groups and individuals from the worst form of racial discrimination&mdash;that which advocates violence and other gross acts against individuals&mdash;and which is intended to reinforce our reputation as a nation that will not tolerate racial hatred, is stuck in the Senate because of the position of the opposition parties. The reality is that the opposition is not interested in achieving real outcomes in terms of issues involving discrimination. That includes the Racial Hatred Bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition is supporting this legislation, its main spokesperson on the matter had nothing to say about the fundamental principles involved here&mdash;that is, the principles of anti-discrimination.

It is scarcely credible that the bill has reached this stage in the House at this time in its present form. The cause of my incredulity will soon become apparent when I explain to the House the history of the events relating to the introduction of the bill to this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 December 1981, the Human Rights Commission was created under the provisions of the Commonwealth Human Rights Commission Act 1981. The act was prompted by the need to implement Australia's international obligations under several international human rights instruments to which we were a party. The Human Rights Commission was empowered to handle complaints, to review legislation and to conduct educational, promotional and research programs in relation to the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations declarations dealing with the rights of the child, of mentally retarded persons and of disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Commission Act included a sunset clause that had the effect of disbanding the commission on 9 December 1986. To replace the defunct commission, the parliament enacted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. That act came into effect on 10 December 1986, the day after the previous act sunsetted, and created the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission giving it functions that were similar in most respects to those of the Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC, is a vehicle for expressing Australia's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations with respect to human rights through complaint handling and education, promotion and policy formulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HREOC is a body corporate and consists of a part-time president, a human rights commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Privacy Commissioner and the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. Each is appointed under a separate act of parliament. The Human Rights Commissioner is the only member required to have legal qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation that was in force for some six years from 1986, the determinations of HREOC were not legally binding. It was necessary for enforcement proceedings to be taken in the Federal Court. Those proceedings were in the form of a fresh hearing, in which evidence was heard and the complaint tried as if it were being brought for the first time. This was a recognition that the commission was not able to make binding, enforceable determinations in matters brought before it. To do so would be purporting to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The Australian constitution provides that only a federal court constituted as such by the Commonwealth parliament can exercise Commonwealth judicial power. The commission is clearly not a federal court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 March 1990, one John Bell lodged a complaint against the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission with the commission alleging that one Harry Brandy had acted in a way that was in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. Both Brandy and Bell were officers of ATSIC. HREOC then held an inquiry into the subject of the complaint. It was not until 22 December 1993 that the commission made a determination in Mr Bell's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this time, the relevant human rights legislation had been the subject of a reference to a Senate committee and had in consequence been amended. On 21 December 1990, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was given a reference to consider the mechanisms available to parties dissatisfied with HREOC determinations. The Senate committee was to consider whether, in view of the constitutional limitations, less costly alternative procedures could be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department made a submission to the committee, the content of which showed that the department was alive to the problem of HREOC's inability to make binding determinations. In its submission dated July 1991, the department stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the power to decide whether alleged conduct in breach of the [Racial Discrimination Act] or [the Sex Discrimination Act] has taken place, and the power to award damages or make restraining orders, are judicial powers and are properly given to the Federal Court. These powers could be given without the need for any prior hearings by the Commission, the functions of which could be limited to conciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, then, as long ago as July 1991 the Attorney-General's Department was well aware that any exercise by HREOC of judicial power in its functions would be unconstitutional and therefore invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee published its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner</EMPHASIS> in November 1992. The so-called majority report was endorsed by four of the eight senators on the committee and a dissenting report was presented by the remaining four senators. The principal recommendation of the majority report was that the legislation be amended to allow a party to a complaint determined by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Privacy Commissioner to register the decision in the Federal Court. After a period of time elapsed the terms of the decision were to become an order of the court with provision for another party to the proceedings to have the matter reviewed by the court. However, in their dissenting report, Senators Vanstone, Kemp, O'Chee and Walsh&mdash;the first three being coalition senators and the fourth a Labor senator&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Privacy Commissioner should have power to inquire into alleged breaches of the legislation and, wherever possible, to endeavour by conciliation to settle matters to which the alleged breaches relate. However, where conciliation is unsuccessful or inappropriate, the matter should be directly referred to the Federal Court for adjudication.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1992, the Commonwealth parliament enacted the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act. That act provided, among other things, for a person to be able to register a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court and for that determination to then take effect as an order of the Federal Court, as the majority of the Senate committee recommended in November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later that year, on 27 August 1993, the Attorney-General announced that his own department, with the Department of Finance and HREOC, would conduct a joint review of the role, functions, efficiency and effectiveness of HREOC. The steering committee conducting the review was to report at the end of February 1994.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question; she is obviously very interested in this. One of the initiatives we have implemented this year as a result of the recent budget is helping to fund the Anzac Health and Medical Research Foundation, which is to be attached to the hospital at Concord, the old repatriation hospital. It is true that the veteran community is ageing at 2 1/2 times the rate of the general community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago I was approached by the foundation, which had been set up, and asked to see whether there was some way that we could supply some help to it in the area of research.  The state government of New South Wales was also approached and asked whether it would give dollar for dollar what we would give. The reason that the Anzac foundation purposes are something which I and the government fully support is that what it wants to do is further the knowledge of medicine, health care and science by conducting research on disease and health care issues that significantly impact on Australians and their families and undertake research to study and improve health care delivery and outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular importance to my department is the particularly strong emphasis that this research will have on the health and well-being of the veteran community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the press release he makes a claim in regard to a particular class of investments, which is quite significant. These are the so-called managed investments in which people invested prior to 1988 and that were, as we said, saved under the changed rules that were introduced in 1988. From 1988 onwards, capital growth on those investments was assessed on an accruals basis. Prior to that they were assessed on a realisations basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have said as part of this new package of arrangements is that, once we are able to get the enabling legislation for the new pension measures through the parliament, when people realise those investments all that capital growth will be written off for the purposes of the social security income test. This is a major and substantial concession that has been welcomed by pensioner organisations and the finance industry. Yet this particular press release from the member for Berowra reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the investment is cashed in and reinvested any income accumulated over the years, which may well be significant, will be counted in one hit affecting the pension over the following year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, one of the things that will impact upon interest rates&mdash;and there are many factors which do, some of them external, some of them domestic&mdash;is the extent to which the government pursues a policy of fiscal tightening. The budget surplus that the government brought down in the statements made by the Treasurer earlier last month are absolutely critical in that regard&mdash;not only in the short term but also in the long term with the position put of achieving a surplus in all of the out years, associated with the budget papers, and with what was done on superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of the legislation associated with the budget, and the achievement over the long term of that improvement in private savings, will have a substantial impact on the environment in which interest rates are determined. That is what is before this House. That is the response of the nation to the situation in which it finds itself and the response of the government to the need to ensure that interest rates operate under the lowest possible pressures imposed by government fiscal policy upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as you are concerned, in your role in your party, what you ought to do is to urge your senators to pass that in toto and to cooperate with us in improving people's long-term living standards and improving our savings performance by adopting a similar approach when the superannuation legislation comes before them.</PARA>

But the task of this parliament, and the task of opposition members in the Senate in particular, is to ensure that that environment persists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, indeed, the government does remain committed to indexation of the social security system. Almost every facet of the system is now subject to indexation, even at today's low inflation rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a rather different situation when contrasted with the record of the Leader of the Opposition. When he became Treasurer in 1978 his first act was to deny pensioners one indexation increase and reduce the frequency of indexation of pensions from six monthly to annually. It had the effect of denying, in real terms, pensioners one full pension payment in the relevant six-month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our commitment to indexation, in a tough fiscal environment, is not a minor or trivial one. Every dollar by which you increase the age pension, with flow throughs, involves an increase in outlays of some $200 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In September the basic rates of pension will be increased quite substantially in response to the CPI movements in the first six months of this year. We will accept that fiscal burden because we believe that the provision of an adequate safety net for pensioners and others has to be a central part of government social policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition started to slide away from that. The justification of the now Leader of the Opposition, then Treasurer, for reducing the frequency of indexation was that the inflation rate had fallen to eight per cent. It had come down to this magnificent figure of eight per cent. Under those circumstances he did not think it was warranted to keep on pursuing full indexation. If we followed that logic, now that underlying inflation is down at about three per cent, we would index every three years or so, wouldn't we? This is the level of the commitment of the opposition to the provision of this basic safety net. On the one hand, it goes on about inequality and poverty. On the other hand, its record is in stark contrast to that of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already made reference to the indexation of the basic pensions and allowances in September. In July a number of other key features of the social security system will be indexed. They include: the income test free area for all pensioners will rise from $90 to $94 per fortnight for a single pensioner, and from $78 to $82 per fortnight for each member of a pensioner couple. Part-rate pensions will now be paid on incomes up to $19,671 for a single pensioner, and $32,822 for a pensioner couple. Likewise, the assets test thresholds will be going up for a single home owner to $118,000, and for partnered home owners it will be going up to $167,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be some quite substantial rises, in excess of indexation, in the limits that will allow people on low incomes to gain access to the health care card. The reason for that is, as well as the normal indexation, the reconfiguration of the allowance income test, which will take place as from July this year. That will raise those thresholds and access to that benefit to quite considerable numbers of additional people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not like to be reminded of these things. The Leader of the Opposition is relying on people not remembering his actions while he was in a position to act and to exercise power. However, the age pensioners in particular have been around for a bit. They will remember his action. They will remember what he did with indexation. They will remember the real decline in pensions under him and contrast that with the real increases under us. He will be judged on that basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, I remind members, was established in 1989 for the purposes of `aiding in the protection of the Australian people and the environment by finding out the risks to occupational health and safety, to public health and to the environment that could be associated with the importation, manufacture or use of chemicals'. I am pleased to say that the review has endorsed the quality of NICNAS's assessments, describing the organisation's assessment capability as a valuable national resource.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago it was put to me by the chemical industry that it was finding that the costs of assessment and the time taken for assessment were acting as a barrier to the importation of safer chemicals into Australia. Our report has found that to be so in some cases and that we ought to take note of that and change the mechanisms of assessment. The 3M company provided a list of 120 products which it claimed were considered for introduction to Australia but had not progressed as a result of the costs and time to be taken for these assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NICNAS has the responsibility for the assessment of new as well as existing chemicals. The review has recommended that the principal costs of NICNAS be linked to the hazard that a chemical poses as a way of creating an incentive for reducing risks from industrial chemicals and of course to encourage the introduction of safer chemicals. The report also states that costs should be spread amongst all manufacturers and importers of existing industrial chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another most important recommendation is that there should be established a project team to develop a preliminary screening procedure capable of determining the level of assessment needed for any given chemical within five days. I think that is welcome news. When I make my response to the report, I hope I can say we can implement that. There should also be a greater use of overseas assessments and mechanisms to identify a more hazardous chemical that is being replaced, which should reduce the assessment fee for both new and existing chemical programs.</PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1983" SPEAKER="Martin The Hon S.P." NAMEID="8I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CUNNINGHAM">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I present the following draft proposals by the working group on the code of conduct for all members of the Commonwealth parliament: a framework of ethical principles for members and senators and a framework of ethical principles for ministers and Presiding Officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will recall that in 1991 the then Prime Minister proposed that a working group of parliamentarians be established to develop a seminar on the standards of conduct expected of members and senators. It is fair to say that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) was instrumental in this development and was probably also a key player in the subsequent decision by that first working group to develop a code of conduct for members and senators and to explore means of disseminating information about the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first working group did not begin its task until late 1992. By February 1993, when the parliament was prorogued and the House dissolved, the original working group had not been able to complete its deliberations. In March 1994, as part of what came to be termed in the Senate the `accountability package' following the resignation of the former member for Canberra from the ministry, Senator Evans wrote to me and the President. He asked us to reconvene the working group and to provide a report on a code of conduct, to include in its consideration of ministerial conduct the issue of the proper extent of ministerial discretion in disbursing funds under discretionary programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President and I sought the assistance of party leaders in nominating members to the working group and by June 1994 the new group was able to hold its first meeting. It consisted of the Presiding Officers as co-chairs and Senator Vicky Bourne, Senator Christabel Chamarette, the honourable member for North Sydney, Senator McKiernan, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), Senator Robert Ray, Senator Margaret Reid, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and Senator Grant Tambling. The working group thus constituted representatives from all parties in the parliament and independent representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working group had firstly to consider some threshold issues, including what the code was intended to provide, what its status should be and how it should be managed. Specific questions considered by the group included: should it contain simply a supplement to existing guidelines as outlined in the constitution, determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal and so on? Should it contain detailed statements of the conduct required of members and senators in all conceivable situations? Should it attempt to address abstract but critical issues such as the difference between representation of interests and conflict of interest? Should it be a general code of ethics outlining values or a general code of conduct with examples of appropriate and inappropriate conduct or a specific code of conduct with lengthy and detailed statements regulating the activities of members and senators? How should a code be managed&mdash;who could formally allege breaches, who could judge them and what would be appropriate penalties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working group was not a formally constituted committee of the parliament and privilege did not, therefore, attach to its deliberations. Taking this into account, and wishing to test whether there were widely shared public views on the matters under consideration, the group decided to place advertisements in all metropolitan newspapers in July 1994. Twenty-six people responded. These were taken into account in the group's subsequent deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group also relied heavily on major work done in this field by the Queensland Electoral and Administrative Review Commission in 1992 and earlier by the committee of inquiry concerning public duty of private interest&mdash;that is, the Bowen committee&mdash;established by the Fraser government in 1978, which presented its report in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group spent many hours in debating the issues involved, in a total of 10 meetings. I will not detain the House with a detailed account of the differences in interpretation amongst members of the group: they will be able to present their views more cogently than I in debate that will follow. It is sufficient for me to say that the principal difference within the group was on the fundamental question of whether the code should consist of a very detailed set of rules and procedures governing all aspects of the behaviour of a member of parliament, or whether it should be an aspirational set of principles or values, within which each member must make appropriate decisions concerning his or her own behaviour. A clear majority of the group felt it should be the latter. The draft codes I have just presented reflect this view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group has decided there was a need for two documents. Firstly, there should be a document outlining a framework of reference for all members and senators in discharging their responsibilities. This is the code entitled, as I have suggested, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A framework of ethical principles for members and senators</EMPHASIS>. It sets out the fundamental principles and the minimum standards of behaviour the Australian people have a right to expect of their elected representatives. It covers such things as loyalty to the nation, diligence and economy, respect for the dignity and privacy of others, integrity, primacy of the public interest, the proper exercise of influence, and personal conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group was aware that there would be inevitable criticism of the code for the nature and imprecision of the language used. But it must be remembered that the group was proceeding from the majority view that there was little to be served by producing a detailed and prescriptive document. In addition, as outlined in the introduction to the framework, it does not seek to anticipate circumstances or to prescribe behaviour in hypothetical cases. While terms such as the `public interest' or `just cause' are not capable of definition in the abstract, over time each house will develop a body of interpretation and clarification which has regard to individual cases and contemporary values. The group envisages that each house would consider matters raised under this code and that a majority of two-thirds of members of a house would be necessary to resolve a matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the group saw a need for an additional framework to cover the circumstances of ministers, including parliamentary secretaries, and the Presiding Officers, in whom there is greater trust placed and by whom substantial power and discretion are exercised. This additional framework includes principles such as impartiality, honesty, the use of influence and the appropriate use of influence, public property and services, and official information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will share with me, I am sure, a concern for the public esteem in which we are held as parliamentarians by the Australian community. In my view, it is only by individually observing the principles outlined in these frameworks that we will begin to redress the public perception. I do not believe that a prescriptive and detailed document would serve that purpose, but I look forward to hearing the views of members on the issues involved. I commend the draft framework documents to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is particularly poignant that when we come to debates on issues of poverty the modern members of the Labor Party largely vacate the chamber and leave the matters of raising issues relating to the plight of poor to members on this side of the House. Amongst the few that remain, I think every one of them should hang their heads in shame at the increasing disparity of wealth between the richest and poorest in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have another report, and a very significant report, revealing that all the government has been saying on this matter is false and that it is obfuscating on these matters, knowing that it has delivered this disastrous situation. We had no better example of that yesterday than the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) himself. I should remind members that when he was asked a question by my colleague the member for Ryan (Mr Moore) about this report he answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this government has put in place a social safety net which has ensured that the poor have been protected and their interests advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have been putting in place for the poor and needy in Queensland&mdash;and everyone else in this country&mdash;is a social safety net which sustains a reasonable life for those people.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no clearer statement that can be demonstrated to be not true than that statement. There is a litany of reports  which we have seen over and over again, statistical and academic, which have outlined in not only anecdotal terms but statistical terms that Australia is now confronted with an increasing problem of poverty and an increasing gap between the richest and the poorest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent notable report on that matter was the Gregory report. Gregory is an academic often very favourably quoted by the government but when he revealed his report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The macro economy and the growth of ghettos and urban poverty in Australia</EMPHASIS> the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) attempted to rationalise it away. The government has repeatedly claimed that its social safety net and social wages are `offsetting the poverty problems and reducing the inequality gap'. I guess we will probably hear that argument from this minister again today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, the latest, prepared by the Council of Social Security, the Social Action Office, the Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes, Brisbane Lifeline and the Sisters of Mercy of Rockhampton entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drawing the line on poverty</EMPHASIS>, is more evidence that the government's argument is not sustainable. More importantly, it demonstrates that it is not just this opposition that is making that charge; it is every substantial and creditable body that can comment on these matters. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary says, `You can do better than that.' I agree. We can do a great deal better because we are going to go through and reveal the facts that demonstrate beyond doubt your record. This report looked at all of the arguments of definitions of poverty and disadvantage and looked at issues such as how many people are disadvantaged, who is disadvantaged, the geographical factors affecting poverty and disadvantage and the material circumstance of those who are disadvantaged&mdash;that is, what it is like to live on a low income in Queensland, in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the report, we see that it contains many poignant facts and statistics. I want to let those statistics speak for themselves. They show that sole parent families, couples with three or more children, and young single people have the greatest chance of being in poverty; that one-fifth of the Queensland population live in poverty; that Queensland's poverty rate is two per cent greater than the national average; that 18 per cent&mdash;that is, 350,000 people&mdash;live below the poverty line; that 26 per cent&mdash;that is, 136,000 people&mdash;of those who live in poverty in your state of Queensland are children; that 27.2 per cent of elderly people live in poverty; and that two in every three sole parents exist below the poverty line. These are the statistics. This is the record of Queensland today and the problems faced by Queenslanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the government's argument about the social wage and the safety net because this is the excuse; this is the way in which the government tries to rationalise it out of the way. This government minister regularly claims that in respect of the social wage&mdash;that is, non-cash benefits such as health benefits, housing and education&mdash;the government is acting to improve the position of the needy and bridge the poverty gap. That is the argument advanced by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument is not reflected in this report's statistics which show that vast numbers of people living in poverty are not assisted in that way. I will go through the findings&mdash;and I hope the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is a Queensland member, has read these matters himself. On the issue of housing, on page 81 of the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout every section of the findings from this research, the issue of housing has emerged as a central issue impacting on poverty and disadvantage . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The report has found that public housing plays a critical role in providing assistance to disadvantaged households. However, the report says that Queensland is suffering from a growing demand which is not being met by supply and that new strategies providing low cost housing are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that say? It says that, where you have a state government of the Labor persuasion which has been in power for six years and a federal government of the Labor persuasion which has been in power for 13 years, these matters have not been addressed. On the issue of the inadequacy of housing which is there to address the needs of the most vulnerable, there is nobody else whom those opposite can blame except the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go on to other matters. On page 84, the report has this to say on health:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is consistent evidence arising from this research and other studies which indicates the strain put on low income families by the need to meet extra expenses in addition to basic costs of education.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also says that there is a need to improve assistance to low income families so that they can deal with additional school and school related expenses&mdash;costs of uniforms, excursions and other activities&mdash;which place a burden on them and can result in their children suffering both educationally and socially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 55 of the report, there are examples of concerns relating to quality and range of services available at public hospitals and problems of access to health services arising from the need to travel large distances on public transport. The most major health issue identified was the lack of access to quality dental services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the better off you are economically and socially, the more healthy you are likely to be. We have a situation where the poorest do not benefit by those programs. In other words, the problem of ill-health is greatest amongst the low income group. These are the people, as we are told by the government, who are being addressed through its social wage initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that these non-cash benefits act to bridge the gap; yet there is this evidence which shows that that gap is widening and not narrowing. That is substantiated in this report by the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the likelihood of a single person being in poverty in 1990 was almost double that of a single person in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Gregory&mdash;another source&mdash;found that from 1976 to the present the absolute gap in the university degree distribution between areas has widened and increased the incidence of degree qualifications being disproportionately spread in areas of high socioeconomic status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available to me, I want to pick up one other issue in this report. It relates to the most recent statistical evidence resulting out of a study. An argument I hear coming from government members is that some of the government statistics that were relied upon are dated in the context of Queensland. It is important to look at what the government was doing in relation to emergency relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Emergency relief was the subject of a specific study by the government. The government had a number of things to say about the distribution of emergency relief in Queensland at the time. The study showed that, of all household units with children presenting for assistance, the largest group was sole parent families&mdash;totalling 54 per cent. Couples with children were highly represented among applicants for this form of assistance, and single people were also highly represented. Young people aged 15 to 24 years constituted 28.9 per cent of all applicants in the survey. Indigenous people made up 20 per cent of applicants, far higher than their representation in the wider community. By far, the largest group of applicants received a government pension or benefit as their main source of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the point I come to now. Here we have people who are supported by the government's safety net, yet the great bulk of them are those who proportionately constitute claimants for emergency relief. On page 41 of the report, there is an analysis of that. It said that by far the greatest proportion of all applicants were in receipt of government pensions and benefits. In other words, 82 per cent of all the people who receive emergency aid and support in Queensland were already reliant upon government pensions and benefits. They needed supplementation. The largest group were those who were on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Gibson" NAMEID="ST4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is to assist those people in this case who have needs that are not being addressed by the programs that your government has put in place. That is the point, and it is beyond doubt. It shows that you put these programs in place and claim that there is not only direct assistance but also supplementary assistance in the form of a social wage, but it clearly is not enough to address their needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report demonstrates that you are more likely to want that assistance if you are on unemployment benefits or you are a sole parent or disability pensioner. That is the important point that needs to be understood. It demonstrates, more clearly than any other statistic or report could do, the failure of your government and its policies. I want to put it in the context of unemployment, because that is the area that demonstrates more clearly than any other why, under your regime, some people are getting increasingly poorer while the small number of people at the top are getting increasingly wealthier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's emphasis on the social wage forced me to look at this issue. I think it is vital to understand what has happened: if an unemployed person had a job previously he may have been in receipt of a significant income. When he goes on to unemployment benefits, he will have a marked reduction in his overall standard of living. The statistics bear this out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people who fall into the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent between 1989 and 1993. That is the record of a Labor government in Queensland and the record of a Labor government here in Canberra. Even if you take into account social security payments and the social wage, the inequality is only marginally alleviated. The recipients do not enjoy a standard of living which is comparable with the rest of society or a standard of income that they would enjoy if they were in employment. That is the major issue that faces this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few weeks, I have had an opportunity to visit significant parts of Queensland. I have also met with groups of independent retirees. What you find in relation to the studies that have been undertaken is that, as a result of the policies of the government, these people have suffered significant reductions in their income level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are unemployed, you have lost your job, where you were on a reasonable income and you are now having to exist on unemployment benefits, of course you are part of the new poor. If you are an independent retiree&mdash;you would have planned for your future and would have expected to be able to survive on an income earned from assets that you had set aside&mdash;and then you see your assets ripped away from you and you see interest rates being reduced, you become part of the new poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister keeps on saying that these people are able to go on benefits. Of course they are, but at a much reduced standard of living for the family that is involved. That is why they are joining the ranks of the poorest. This is another report, another statement, which is a clear indictment of the policies of Labor in Queensland and Labor in Canberra. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just make the initial point that the purpose of this is to score a few points against the Queensland government. But, in fact, the ABS survey on which some of these claims are based was conducted in the 1989-90 year&mdash;that is, less than a year after the Goss government was elected. If those opposite are attempting to suggest that, somehow, the relatively worse position allegedly shown in Queensland is as a consequence of Goss government policy, the timing of that survey belies that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could go on to the substance&mdash;if you can call it that&mdash;of the matter of public importance put forward, the issue of poverty and the right policy measures to alleviate poverty is a central element of concern by this government. But the sort of treatment that you get of this important issue from the opposition certainly does not deserve serious consideration. I will go to some of the major reports and studies that have been done. One that has received quite a degree of attention in recent weeks has been the report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council on the growth in inequalities in earned income that has taken place in this country, as it has throughout the developed world. This EPAC report, while making that point, also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government policies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Australian government policies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have played a significant role in ameliorating the effects of changes in market income distribution. The policies include progressive income taxation, targeted social security benefits and the health, housing, education and other community services which comprise the `social wage'.</PARA>
<PARA>The EPAC report, on which a lot of this discussion is based, explicitly acknowledges that this government has been benign in acting to offset those trends towards greater market income and equality that are being driven&mdash;I think this is accepted by most experts&mdash;by structural changes in the global economy, the effects of technology and so forth. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, levels of taxation and social welfare arrangements appear to be sustainable over the medium or longer term, unlike in many other developed countries.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many positive features of the Australian standard of living, in terms of leisure enjoyed, levels of home ownership, standards of private and public infrastructure, and a well developed welfare system targeted at those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that EPAC report reflects very favourably on the achievements that this government has made in the area of social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to changes in earnings, under Labor real wages and household incomes have increased substantially. Since June 1983, full-time adult ordinary earnings have increased in real terms by 8.7 per cent. We need to emphasise the strength of employment growth, and I have a few statistics relevant to Queensland that I will quote in a minute. With rising employment, social security improvements and tax changes, total real household disposable income has increased by around 40 per cent. That is what has been happening to disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to the issue of poverty in particular and look at those who depend on the social safety net and contrast what has happened under this government with what happened under the coalition government, we will see that there has been a real increase of 12 per cent in the base pension rate&mdash;I emphasise that these are real increases&mdash;and that contrasts with a two per cent decline under the coalition. There have been real increases of between 75 per cent and 150 per cent in payments for children, particularly those payments targeted to low income families, and that is a huge change. Going back to the period when the coalition was in government, we find that the equivalent payments were vastly less and that only about one-tenth of the people who should have been receiving the payments were covered. So in those terms the improvements have been dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition spokesman referred to people on low incomes who are outside the public housing sector. There have been real increases in payments to private renters of between 75 per cent and 135 per cent under the rent assistance scheme. Again this is targeted to low income people, people on the social safety net or on low wages and who are living in private rented accommodation. I stress that these increases have occurred not only in real terms but also against the so-called Henderson poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a few examples of what I mean. The income of a single pensioner renting privately has increased from six per cent to 13 per cent above the Henderson poverty line, the income of a sole parent with two children renting privately has increased from nine per cent below to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line, and the income of an unemployed couple with one child and renting privately has increased from 11 per cent below to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted by EPAC, the social wage measures are also very important, particularly when you are talking about health, Medicare, increased education participation, expanded superannuation coverage and improved child care. If you can put it all together, Commonwealth social wage expenditure is up by 73 per cent in real terms per person, after falling by 33 per cent under the coalition. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra estimates that in 1994 social wage benefits from health, housing, child care and education were worth an average of $195 a week for a two-child family. So these are very significant things. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling also shows that these benefits are worth far more for the lowest income families than they are for higher income families and they reduce inequality in Australia substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question in the House the other day I made the point that, when you look at income inequality between the top quintile and the bottom quintile, the ratio of inequality falls from 13 to one to four to one when you add social wage expenditures to people's cash income. Other measures to help people to help themselves include the child support scheme; the jobs, employment and training program for sole parents; and the new bank deeming arrangements for pensioners. These are some of the reforms the government has introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important issue of all is employment. We have had a period of obviously unacceptably high unemployment, and that is obviously a phenomenon that is prevalent throughout the developed world. But, if you look at the overall picture under this government, you will see that the total number of jobs is up from six million to eight million and there has been a 663,000 increase since the last election. In that respect, we are outperforming all the world's major economies in employment growth. The opposition loves to try to find areas where it says we are worse&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Queensland in a minute. Employment growth is an area where a great deal has been achieved, particularly in the last two years. Our objective is to bring unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000. We obviously want to get it below that, but that is the realistic objective we have set ourselves and we are on track to do that. The new measures, including the job compact, are specifically focusing on the needs of the long-term unemployed to make sure that they have an opportunity to participate in the labour market and society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to Queensland, since Queensland has been mentioned in this context, I will give a few numbers that give some idea of the contrast between government and coalition performance. During Mr Howard's period as Treasurer, which was 1978 to 1983, jobs grew by an average of only 20,600 in Queensland. Under the federal Labor Party, from 1983 to 1995, jobs grew in Queensland by an average of 43,600 a year&mdash;more than double the number a year under the coalition. In the last 12 months, there has been an increase of 91,200 jobs in Queensland, including a 6.2 per cent increase in Brisbane, a 13.3 per cent increase in north and west Moreton, an 8.7 per cent increase in Mackay-Fitzroy in the central west and a 12.9 per cent increase in Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no doubt that a comprehensive strategy to address poverty has to have creating employment growth as its centrepiece. We are delivering on that and we are rapidly overcoming the difficulties that have stemmed from the last recession and the high rates of unemployment that resulted from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, when looking at poverty, you need to factor in a range of things. As well as cash income and social security payments, you need to factor in the so-called social wage&mdash;health, housing, education, child care, et cetera. No academic study has totally comprehensively taken these into account. But the important issue is policy. We have done something about poverty. The opposition does not care. The opposition wants a US or UK style labour market deregulation. The EPAC report shows clearly that inequality in the UK is 50 per cent more than in Australia, in Canada is 75 per cent more and in the USA is 150 per cent more&mdash;more than 2 1/2 times what it is in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks about the growth of earnings inequality. Yes, it has gone up nine per cent from 1981 to 1991 in Australia, but compare that with 15 per cent in Canada, 17 per cent in the USA and 27 per cent in the UK. Labour market deregulation opposition-style means more working poor. In the United States, for example, 14 per cent of the US work force earns less than the commonly used poverty line of 50 per cent of median earnings, and that is more than three times the Australian proportion. This government has acted to ameliorate market income inequality. Governments in the USA and the UK have exacerbated that inequality. This is the key point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just good enough to talk about levels of inequality; you have to look at what the impact of policy is. There is no doubt that countries that have gone down the route of wholesale labour market deregulation, as proposed by the opposition, and countries that have gone down the route of cutting the social wage, as proposed by the opposition, are precisely the countries where you find the most severe trends towards greater inequality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition continue to quote the Gregory and Hunter study as if it indicates growing poverty. They distort the Gregory and Hunter study. What it does indicate to a very substantial extent is that public housing policies have become better targeted over the last 15 years or so. The honourable member for Berowra asked me for information on this a couple of days ago. Well, let me provide it to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland study quoted by the honourable member for Berowra demonstrates the point. That study shows that the proportion of public housing in the lowest income areas is up to 88 per cent&mdash;we are talking about census collection districts&mdash;compared with the state-wide average of four per cent. Improved targeting of public housing is demonstrated by the fact that the proportion of public tenants receiving rent rebates has risen from 52 per cent in 1981-82 to 81 per cent in 1991-92. As I said, there has been a conscious and deliberate policy by all the state authorities to sharpen the targeting of public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that there has been a compositional change in the nature of the poorer suburbs. The individuals in those suburbs who are dependent on the social safety net are clearly better off because of our social security and other policies. But there has been a greater concentration due to that increased targeting of public housing. Professor Gregory's study says nothing about the substantial degree of mobility in Australia. For example, between 1986 and 1991, 30 per cent of public housing tenants moved out, largely to purchase their own homes. That is relevant to the point that the member for Berowra made about the proportion of people with higher education in low income areas. The fact is that, if you gain a higher degree or a degree and you come from a low income area, you will tend to move out of it and out of public housing. It does not mean that the degree of access of people in those areas to those education resources has diminished. The direct contrary is the case. Professor Gregory has also given very strong support to the white paper initiatives, the Working Nation initiatives, designed to reduce disparities in both employment and wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the report quoted by the member for Berowra. The most obvious point to make it that it is absurd to use this report against the Goss Labor government in Queensland. As I have pointed out, the data for the poverty estimates were collected in 1989-90, the year the Goss Labor government came to power. To the extent that poverty estimates have any meaning, then that meaning is confined to the legacy of 32 years of coalition National Party rule in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The report uses the Henderson poverty line and the 1989-90 survey of income and housing costs and amenities. Since then there have been a range of initiatives from the government in the areas of family payments, child support and so forth. But it must be understood that the Henderson poverty line is updated according to changes in household disposable income per person. This has increased in real terms by nearly 20 per cent since 1983. So an income on the poverty line today would buy much more than it did when the government was first elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a conceptual flaw in the way these poverty lines are constructed. There is quite a debate about this, but there is a sort of moving goal post. The movement in the poverty line&mdash;that 20 per cent real increase&mdash;is to a significant extent driven by the increase in the number of dual income households that has occurred under this government's&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member was desperately trying to protect his own hide and the hide of his colleagues in the National Party, because they are the ones who have been exposed for being so bad at administering the state of Queensland. Heaven help us if they were ever to get on the treasury bench of the Commonwealth of Australia. He dared to talk about what the Goss government has done. You failed to talk about the fact that when the Goss government came to power Queensland's record was that it had the lowest level of expenditure on education, health, housing and roads. On every measure you want to talk about, the National Party government in Queensland had the lowest levels of expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened since the Goss government came to power? We have had a 64 per cent increase in expenditure on the public housing stock in Queensland, a massive increase in health expenditure in Queensland, a massive increase in education expenditure in Queensland and the largest growth in jobs in this country. That is the legacy that the Goss government is giving to the people of Queensland, and that is why the Goss government will be returned on 15 July with an increased majority. The people of Queensland know that, when it comes to a fair distribution of the wealth of that state to the people of that state by means of a social wage and by means of expenditure in those areas of government which benefit the people directly, it is the Goss Labor government, as it is the Keating Labor government, that expends money on people and on assisting people. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the cant and hypocrisy of those opposite in this debate will be ignored by the people of Queensland, as it has been ignored by the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra tried to discount totally the social wage. He said, `Whenever the government gets into this debate, it starts talking about income levels and about the social wage. We can discount the social wage. That does not have any real impact.' That is because people like the member for Berowra and his comrade in arms, the member for Kennedy, do not even understand what the social wage is about. Do you know what the social wage means? Do you understand what expenditure on the social wage is about? It means talking about expenditure across society which benefits all members of society. It is talking about expenditure on health, education, jobs and housing. That is where the government of Australia, the Keating Labor government, has a proud record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that those opposite do not like seeing graphs. We have two very good graphs that they need to look at. Firstly, let us look at the value of pensions and benefits during the last period that the Liberal and National parties were in government in Canberra, compared with what has happened in the 12 years that the Labor government has been in power. On the graph, those figures below the line show the constant decline in pensions and benefits that was the legacy of the Fraser-Howard government. What is the legacy for Australia of the Hawke and Keating governments? A massive increase in the real value of pensions and benefits. </PARA>

It shows what this government has spent on expenditure that benefits all Australians, including their children, compared with the legacy of the last Liberal-National Party government, and that is that the social wage expenditure under the Fraser-Howard government from 1977 to 1983 resulted in a 17.5 per cent cut in expenditure on health, education, social welfare and housing. What has been the experience under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments? A real increase over and above inflation of 73 per cent. That is what they do not like to hear about. They do not like to hear about the fact that Labor is committed to helping those people in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th and 12th reports of the committee for 1995 relating to redevelopment works for the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Gungahlin, Australian Capital Territory and the RAAF Base Richmond replacement medical centre, Richmond, New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The subject of the committee's 11th report for 1995 concerns the redevelopment works for the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Gungahlin, ACT. The proposed works will include the replacement of existing temporary and substandard accommodation and the provision of additional facilities to meet expanded functions of the division. The new building complex will incorporate research laboratories and data collection areas, offices, stores, seminar rooms, staff amenities and a central resource facility for graphics, information technology and library. The estimated cost of the proposal is $7 million at January 1995 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Division of Wildlife and Ecology has occupied the Gungahlin site, a semi-rural site located on the Barton Highway approximately seven kilometres north of Canberra's central business area, for over 40 years. The 36 buildings, which mainly occupy the eastern part of the site, are of diverse age, merit and condition. Three of the buildings and their surrounds have a heritage listing including the Gungahlin Homestead, which was constructed in the 1860s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for redevelopment at the Gungahlin site results from a requirement to replace temporary and substandard accommodation and to provide increased facilities to meet expanded functional needs on the site. Overcrowding exists in some laboratories leading to potentially unsafe working conditions and limitations for research usage. Many of the temporary buildings need to be replaced with permanent facilities more appropriate to the needs of the division, providing long-term flexibility, adaptability and ease of maintenance consistent with master plan principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In submissions to the committee the Australian Heritage Commission and the ACT Division of the National Trust of Australia expressed considerable concern regarding the mass and scale of the proposed building A and its form and architectural detail which were not seen as being sympathetic to the adjoining heritage listed Gungahlin Homestead. The placement of building A within the heritage precinct was also of concern. Given the ad hoc developments that have taken place on the site in the past, the Australian Heritage Commission believes that this proposal provides an excellent opportunity to establish a precedent for a more sympathetic design on the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a public hearing, CSIRO indicated that discussions had been held with both organisations and also the National Capital Planning Authority in an attempt to alleviate these concerns. The committee was assured by CSIRO that it will continue to work, during detailed design development, with these organisations to ensure that the design is sympathetic to and respects the prominence that should be afforded to the homestead and the historic nature of the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the Barton Highway entrance should continue to be the main entry point to the Gungahlin site and that the CSIRO should continue discussions with the ACT Department of the Environment, Land and Planning, to resolve issues relating to site entry and the impact on CSIRO activities of proposed roadworks in the vicinity of the Gungahlin site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee is aware that a possible reorganisation of CSIRO's administrative structure is currently under consideration. However, the committee was assured by CSIRO at the public hearing that any reorganisation of administrative structures will not impact at the divisional level and will not affect the proposal being considered by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject of the committee's 12th report for 1995 is the provision of a replacement medical centre and associated medical facilities at RAAF base Richmond, New South Wales. The proposed works consist of a medical centre complex, an operational health support and training facility and associated engineering services. The estimated cost of the project when referred to the committee was $11.4 million at July 1993 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major features of the medical centre are that it provides the Australian Defence Force with a unique aviation medicine service, it has air transportable medical equipment and its staff are trained and exercised to deploy and operate anywhere in Australia or overseas as a complete air transportable hospital. The staff, and allocated reservists, receive specialised medical training as well as the normal range of military training to allow them to provide health services in the field under operational conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The medical centre currently occupies a conglomerate of interlinked buildings in the centre of the base. The main building is of brick construction dating from the mid-1930s and houses an operating theatre, administrative areas and several wards. Ancillary buildings are of timber framed, asbestos clad construction with galvanised iron roofs dating from the early 1940s, and are used for wards and ancillary medical functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The condition of the buildings can generally be described as being decrepit and incompatible with the performance of contemporary medical procedures. They present a high maintenance commitment and a fire safety problem and, despite the best endeavours of the base medical staff, compliance with statutory requirements for occupational health and safety is questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee raised with Defence the question of the long-term future of RAAF Richmond and also the impact of the development of the Badgerys Creek airport on flying operations at RAAF Richmond. Defence assured the committee that the RAAF will occupy the base until at least the year 2015. The development of Badgerys Creek will require careful liaison between the RAAF and the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to airspace management. Defence believes that the impact on flying operations from RAAF Richmond will be manageable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing, the committee sought advice from Defence regarding what appeared to be a high usage rate of medical facilities at RAAF Richmond. Defence advised that the usage rate resulted from a combination of factors which stemmed from the fact that essentially military activities are significantly different from civilian life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service personnel are required to present early with their conditions so that their fitness for operational service can be maintained. Because of the fundamental requirement that service personnel become physically fit, a great deal of the outpatient usage results from sporting injuries. Also, as a significant number of single people live on base in barrack accommodation, there is a high incidence of common colds and upper respiratory tract infections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outpatients statistics include immunisations, for which there is a high demand at RAAF Richmond as it is the third busiest airport in Australia for international movements. Service in Cambodia, for example, required some 12 immunisations not all of which could be given together. In addition, aircrew require hypnotic medication to allow them to sleep in adverse circumstances&mdash;a bit like this place!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the high incidence of sporting injuries at RAAF Richmond is of concern to the committee, and it is a trend which the committee has noted at other defence establishments. The committee has decided that it is an issue on which it will be focusing during its forthcoming inquiry into the 1st Field Hospital at Holsworthy, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee obviously recognises the need for service personnel to become and remain physically fit, the methods by which they reach that exalted state&mdash;to which I have long aspired&mdash;may be open to question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was interrupted I was giving an account of the history leading to the introduction of the bill. In August 1993, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) announced that his department, together with the Department of Finance and HREOC, would conduct a joint review of the role and effectiveness of HREOC. The steering committee was to report at the end of February 1994. The steering committee's terms of reference were broad and invited consideration of fundamental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was happening to Mr Bell and Mr Brandy at this time? It was not until December 1993 that HREOC made a determination in Mr Bell's favour. Under the new legislative provisions the commission lodged the determination in the Federal Court on 23 December 1993 and it was registered the same day. On 20 January 1994, after receiving notice of the registration of the determination, Mr Brandy applied to the Federal Court for a review of the determination. He also began proceedings in the High Court claiming that sections of the Racial Discrimination Act providing for registration and review of a determination are invalid by reason of the requirements of chapter III of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eight months later, on 19 September 1994, the initial report of the joint review of HREOC was published. The initial report deals principally with structural matters, issues of management and the use of resources. The initial report gives no detailed consideration to the important question of how human rights functions could or should be performed by the Commonwealth and the state or territory governments on each other's behalf. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues surrounding these co-operative arrangements are complex and closely associated with the performance of HREOC's complaint handling functions. Consideration of these matters has been deferred to a supplementary report, to be produced shortly, in order to have the benefit of the results of HREOC's concurrent review of complaint handling.</PARA>
<PARA>This review of the complaint handling process deals with a fundamental issue. A crucial part of the commission's work is its investigation, conciliation and determination of complaints. Obviously, it is impossible to assess what will be the most suitable management structure for the commission until the review of complaint handling is completed. Nor is it possible to make an informed judgment regarding the best use of the commission's resources until the review of the commission itself is complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional difficulties with the enforcement of determinations were well known to the government and, as I have mentioned, certainly to the Attorney-General's Department before the review was commissioned. The Brandy case was begun in the High Court earlier the same year as the initial report was published. It is quite beyond me to understand why the review of the commission was not finished before any report was issued or recommendations made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not appropriate to be introducing legislation based on an incomplete review. Why then was this bill introduced into the Senate on 7 December last year? Why did not the government, or at least the Attorney-General, do the sensible thing and take a step back and see this matter in its proper perspective. It seems that no-one in the government is doing his or her homework properly. Legislating on the run is no way to make a coherent, cogent system of law that will enhance the citizen's access to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is anxious to appear concerned that all Australians have equal access to justice and to the justice system. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission occupies a particularly important place in the justice system. It is often the only avenue for the poor, for the less advantaged, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, for women and for the disabled to seek redress for unlawful discrimination against them and to enforce their human and civil rights. I reiterate a citation from Mr Tony Morris QC in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> in March 1994 which was referred to by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking [the] risk [that the legislation is valid], the Government is gambling with the money and emotional well-being of those citizens most deserving of its protection: namely the innocent victims of unlawful discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention.</PARA>
<PARA>For the same reason, if HREOC is to work to the best advantage of those who need to have resort to it, it is important, if not vital, that we ensure that the commission is structured and operates properly. It is for this reason that the government should have instructed the steering committee to complete its full review of the commission before it made any recommendations, and certainly before the government introduced legislation to implement any recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also have instructed the steering committee to complete its full review as quickly as possible. A full review would have taken account of the need for a constitutionally valid means of making and enforcing binding determinations on complaints brought under the human rights legislation. Only then would the government be in a position to draft an informed and appropriate legislative response to the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 February 1995, the High Court handed down its decision in the case of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. In that decision, the court found in Mr Brandy's favour. The court held that in seeking to make enforceable determinations the commission was purporting to exercise judicial power in breach of section 71 of the constitution. The effect of the decision is therefore that the commission cannot make a binding, enforceable determination after hearing a compliant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the Brandy decision, the government circulated amendments to the bill in the Senate. The amendments effectively reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of the commission's decision that operated prior to the 1992 amendments&mdash;that is, prior to the inquiry by the Senate committee. The supplementary explanatory memorandum states that these amendments are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an interim measure pending the development of a new mechanism to enforce determinations of the Commission to replace that which was held to be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that a solution is needed in the light of the Brandy decision, but it is not readily apparent why a permanent solution is not being introduced. It is not clear why, given that the government had been warned for so long of the likely invalidity of the scheme for the enforcement of the commission's determinations, it did not consider a permanent solution to the problem earlier. My colleague Senator Vanstone was quoted in the Senate during the committee stage of this bill as saying about the legislation `it is not a question of getting it quickly; it is a question of getting it right.' I endorse Senator Vanstone's comments and add that the government has plainly done neither. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told by the government that the Attorney-General has expanded the review committee which has been examining the role and structure of the commission and has given it the additional task of considering the options for a new permanent scheme. It was to report to the government by June 1995. The committee chaired by Colin Neave in the Attorney-General's Department was expanded to include Mr John Basten QC, Dr Sue Kenny and the Law Reform Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the committee has considered several options and developed a draft proposal, holding consultations with a wide variety of interested groups. The committee has apparently received a range of written submissions and will shortly finalise its proposal. It is now due to provide a report to the government by July 1995, next month. That report could have been commissioned a long time ago and dealt with a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now debating a piece of legislation which will inevitably be recommended for redundancy in several weeks, and possibly even before it receives the royal assent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the comments of the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) in relation to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. I certainly have no quarrels with his historical rendition of the facts. They are, as always, accurate. Certainly in the best of all possible worlds, one that he might inhabit, we would always get these things right. It was obviously a requirement for the government to act speedily in light of the Brandy case to protect complainants who had received a determination from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and were now in a position where those determinations were unenforceable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not always possible to have it all sorted out at the beginning. But, as the member for Tangney has indicated, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has moved to obtain a more effective answer. If you look at the history of the discussion of this very complex legal matter, you will see that the Senate standing committee had a number of different views put to it. Obviously, there was a range of opinions in both the majority and minority report. I suppose parliamentary processes are not always perfect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite legitimate for the government and the Attorney-General, having requested a review of the administration of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, to bring forward some new organisational arrangements. That has been required due to the huge increase in the responsibilities of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission since it was first brought into being in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to go back in history. The member for Tangney referred to the history of this matter, but I wish to go back to when this original bill was being debated. My colleague the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), in his second reading speech on 14 November 1985, reminded the House that the development of our concern and commitment to human rights in this country had considerable bipartisan support even then. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we need to understand is that there have been at least four governments&mdash;three conservative governments and one Labor government prior to this Government . . . which have themselves played a very significant role in the development of an Australian attitude towards the introduction of a Bill of Rights . . . and associated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>He reminded the House:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was elected a member of the United States Nations Commission on Human Rights in the 1950s under the Menzies Government, encouraged by Mr Menzies himself, and as a result it participated in the work of developing and negotiating what became the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to indicate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Fraser Government was responsible for ratifying the Covenant in 1980 . . . the Whitlam Government on 18 December 1972 which signed the Covenant.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the covenant was very important. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 is designed to provide for the coverage of our international treaty obligations, specifically the external affairs powers of the constitution. It has responsibility to give effect to seven of the significant international instruments to which we are a party. One of those instruments is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which deals with a range of human rights that all Australians and all citizens around the globe should be entitled to, including freedom from torture; equality before the law; humane treatment if deprived of liberty; freedom of thought, conscience and religion; peaceful assembly; the ability to stand for office and vote by equal suffrage; marriage and family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second instrument, the Declaration on the Rights of the Child, provides a range of rights, including the right to a name and nationality; adequate nutrition, housing and medical services; education; special treatment and care where a child has a disability; protection from neglect, cruelty and exploitation; adequate care and affection; and security. Other instruments include the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, the Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 111, and the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These have been enshrined in law. Because of the Labor governments and the support over time from conservative governments, this parliament has seen fit to make sure that we did not assume these rights existed and operated in our community; the government gave a legislative commitment to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill which we are considering. From 1986 there has been a huge increase in the responsibilities of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There has been a response to the government on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There has been the development of the Social Justice Commissioner under the same legislation. The Racial Discrimination Act was a key act in relation to this matter, as was the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. There has been the Privacy Commissioner, who is a member of HREOC. So it has now grown considerably in its responsibilities, and that has necessitated various administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) suggested, moved away from the fact that there was a difficulty in the High Court's decision in Brandy v.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What were members of the opposition saying in 1985 when debating the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, some of the attitudes are still very prevalent in the opposition to this day. You only have to look at recent debates on the Racial Hatred Bill to see that. There is not too much that is new in the opposition speeches. If you go back and look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, you can pick this up. This fairly significant member of the opposition at that time said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate that at the very time the Government is celebrating the Whitlam years this House should be debating one of the Whitlam Government's grandest, silliest and potentially most dangerous ambitions. This Bill and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that it creates are in the grand tradition of the Office of the Status of Women, the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations and the various anti-discrimination boards, commissions and tribunals of Australia's thought police who so zealously are determined to change the free and tolerant way of life of ordinary Australians. This Bill and the proposed Commission are more than another example of the thought police at work; they are their corner-stone.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this is the sort of attitude that we hear again and again whenever we are debating issues of human rights in this parliament. In his contribution, the member for Berowra mentioned that, whenever we criticise the opposition for its policies in the area of human rights, we are attacking it as being racist or sexist. But that is not the case. We are talking about the policies of the opposition that do not confront these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at what the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said in his headland speech on 6 June, which was not too long ago, in response to the proposal by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Australia become a republic. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Coalition Government will itself propose to the People's Convention an amendment to the Constitution to re-define the external affairs power.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the very external affairs power which is the basis of much of the position of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in terms of protecting the human rights of all Australians.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know there have been considerable backflips on exactly what is going to be in this people's convention, but there is the hidden agenda of the opposition. As always in these matters, they are more interested in states rights than in human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the people's convention, I refer to the referendum of 1988. This was the referendum that covered a significant number of issues pertaining to human rights. Of course, the opposition opposed these referenda and without opposition support the referenda were lost. In his speech during the second reading debate on the Constitutional Alteration (Parliamentary Terms) Bill 1988, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1985 the then Attorney-General abandoned that sensible idea and set up his own hand-picked Constitutional Commission. It has been an extravagant waste of $6m. Some of its members are eminent Australians, and I do not question their motives. However, the whole exercise has been based on a wrong premise.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that this new idea of the people's convention, which I think was the policy on the run of former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has now been picked up and at least half of the members will be appointed by the alternative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did certain commentators say about the lack of support by the opposition of that referendum in 1988? I quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 8 September 1988. Jim Dunn of the Human Rights Council of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History will record the defeat of the referendum questions as a dismal day for Australia, for it discourages not only reform of our outdated Constitution but also future efforts to upgrade basic human-rights awareness and protection.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was undoubtedly the campaign conducted by the Opposition that ensured the failure of a worthy attempt to make our Constitution more relevant. This campaign was clearly an exercise in shameful opportunism, aimed at fomenting distrust, and creating fears and suspensions that a hidden agenda lurked behind the innocuous referendum proposals. The hidden agenda that now needs exposure is just where does the Coalition leadership stand in relation to those human-rights laws and standards acknowledged to be essential to an effective democracy, and to which past and present governments have committed themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record is not encouraging. Mr Howard's call for oneness and social cohesion is mere jargon, more appropriate to non-democratic states. His negative stand on international humanitarian issues, as well as multiculturalism, immigration, and the enforcement of human-rights protection, is placing at risk Australia's image as a humane, tolerant and concerned member of the democratic world, where these considerations are being taken more seriously.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the opposition's policies have been updated, but I fear that we have yet to see any effective policy from the opposition. All of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> debates on Mabo and on the land fund legislation, and more particularly and more recently the scurrilous campaign on the Hindmarsh Island affair, expose not only key members of the opposition but indeed the lack of leadership from Mr Howard on these matters. It should be a cause of great concern to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Racial Hatred Bill because the Racial Hatred Bill, which is currently log jammed in the Senate, will be under the same provisions as exist in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are currently debating.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of the matter with the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill is that the government moved to have the houses of parliament pass an absolutely unconstitutional process. The government was caught out by the High Court, despite many warnings that what it proposed to do was unconstitutional, and now government members are trying to paper over the fact that the government was caught out with cries of emotionalism and racial discrimination and a whole lot of airy-fairy thoughts that, in fact, have marked all discussions on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is simple. The government was warned that it was doing unconstitutional things, and it proceeded anyway. I contend that as far back as 1992 it was the intention on the part of the government to proceed along unconstitutional lines. One can see the germ of that process in November 1992 in the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee where government members&mdash;Senators Cooney, Giles, Schacht and, surprisingly, Walsh&mdash;and the Democrat member, Senator Spindler, agreed that there should be a new process adopted by the parliament and new powers given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Senate committee recommended that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission be given powers equivalent to the Federal Court and that only in certain cases should matters flow on to the Federal Court. Not surprisingly the High Court of Australia recently found that the government and the senators were wrong. I would like to point out the government's unprincipled behaviour through all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had a course of action before it and pursued it, regardless of what was legal or constitutional because ideology overrode commonsense. Its ideological pursuit of this matter has destroyed the opportunities of many people they sought to protect. It just goes to prove that where the government, regardless of legality, proprietary and constitutionality, seeks to assert its power over the rights of the individuals and the proper processes of courts it will be pulled down and so it should, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Across the whole use of international treaties this government has sought to centralise power in a most improper manner. I agree with Dr Colin Howard when he says that the external affairs power has now become a source of power to legislate upon an ever widening variety of topics, the significance of which is overwhelmingly domestic, not external. He, and others with him, advance the proposition supported by Peter Walsh that legislation or regulation is required by Commonwealth law to delist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He asked the question: what legislation or regulation is required to delist Commonwealth world heritage declared areas which have previously been listed? The reply from the minister indicated that for Australia to delist areas in which it has been entrapped into international treaties would require a two-thirds majority of approval of the United Nations World Heritage Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the most free nations on earth. The fact that the United Nations declares us to be so does not mean that we have a rest from having discrimination dealt with and further freedoms advanced. But we should not have to rely, as some teenager does, on an authority vested in the United Nations. That is juvenile behaviour. The government seems to rest on this juvenile process rather than having confidence in its own ability and in the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A people's convention, according to members, is the last thing that this government wants to do. It would rather pass laws, unconstitutional laws, in secret and hope that its ideology will be carried through by people improperly appointed to carry out an ideologically qualified process which has the power of the courts. That is a wrong process and is a denigration of the freedoms of Australians. The fact of the matter is that if it can be done by the Left it can be done by the Right, too. It is a most dangerous precedent to set, to build ideological bias into the legal processes that denigrates the rights of Australians. That is what would have happened under the government's proposal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member would know&mdash;he is trying to argue that there is limited access&mdash;that 95 per cent of cases are settled by conciliation. It is a largely successful and very proper process under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The fact that a few cases need to go on to court is proper process also. How else do we get exactitude in this matter? We have changes in commissioners and imprecise process before the commission. You get bad law, bad results, inconsistent results. So the court must stand behind the commission in relation to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to the coalition's dissenting report to the proposal of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The dissenting members of the coalition were Andrews, Bailey, Cadman, Costello, Ronaldson and Sinclair. A spectrum of views across the coalition cannot endorse what the government then at a later point proceeded to do. At this stage I need to point out that the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives at that time was the current Attorney-General. He pursued this course, despite having had advice that the process was wrong and likely to be challenged at some point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those dissenting members of the coalition said that, as far as the Sex Discrimination Act and the Racial Discrimination Act are concerned, complaints should first be dealt with by the process of conciliation. We said that, although there were some inadequacies about the process which had been noted in the submissions, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the conciliation process. There were 634 submissions&mdash;the inquiry went for over two years&mdash;and yet the Attorney-General ignored those and proceeded with the legislation which was overturned by the High Court and which is now being amended today. So it was the role, the function and the proper approach of coalition members to oppose those recommendations in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the government achieved in this process? We have a coalition that wants to endorse the proper processes and ensure that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission does properly cover the areas of racial discrimination, sex discrimination and disability discrimination&mdash;and it has generally supported the government in this process. But here we have an area where the government was determined to proceed against advice, and we have a mess on our hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government has had to come back and say that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission needs to be a process of reconciliation and, where there is dispute, it should go on to the Federal Court. Ninety-five per cent of the cases are settled by conciliation. That is a great record. This is the way these matters should be settled&mdash;not by black-letter law processes. They should be settled by conciliation because in that way we build up a process of learning and understanding in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the proper reports, despite the warnings from the coalition, on 7 December 1994 the government pursued a decision that it knew to be doubtful. It gambled with the lives and feelings of those who most needed its support, including those associated with the cases which were heard in the period between 7 December 1994 and the present. The government was prepared to take a risk it should not have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed that in the explanatory memorandum there is a proposal that there must be some compensation for those people who have been disadvantaged by the government's inadequacies in this process. The government wanted to pursue a course which was untested and ideologically warped&mdash;and it has been found to be wrong in doing so. Now we come back to legislation that is before the House which rectifies those shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area the government claims to stand for people. It claims that it is not for states rights or any structural rights or institutional rights. But really, it claims, it stands for the rights of people. Just see how fair the government is in matters of access and equity. I refer government members to the statement of the federal Attorney-General made on 20 June 1995. Referring to the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), the Attorney-General said that the Western Australian government had `an obligation to pay Dr Lawrence's legal costs' and if it refused to do so, `the Commonwealth will provide appropriate financial support'. Is that equal opportunity? How many Aussies have that chance, which was extended to a favoured friend of the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that the government's Justice Statement was assessed by the government on the basis of what federal electorates it most advantaged. I believe that the details of that Justice Statement were pored over in your party back rooms and in ministerial offices and that the Justice Statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Justice for all</EMPHASIS>, was assessed on whose electorate it advantaged. That is the way in which the Labor Party does things: look after your mates first and blow the rest of Australia. That is the cavalier approach of the Australian Labor Party to what should be an equal opportunity for all. It has disregarded that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter whether it is in the jobs area, employment programs, new work opportunities, job clubs or any other of the employment programs, the way in which this government works is first to assess the impact on its own seats. It does not care or give any consideration to Australia as a totality. Government members come in here and talk about the Racial Discrimination Act. I heard the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I think it was, raving on here and the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) saying that the Racial Discrimination Act is the core of what the government is doing today. That is just sheer bunkum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was caught out. It did the wrong thing. It was ideologically warped in the way in which it wanted to approach these important issues. Now it tries to tag this matter with a political edge against the coalition. The government is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer government members to what they are doing in that legislation. I do not know whether they have really tried to assess what they are proposing to do. With this legislation, despite warnings from all legal sources, despite what the Americans and the British have done, the government has built into the process of racial discrimination and racial hatred terms that will be impossible for the court to determine. Yet the government proclaims the fact that it will be fair and equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the communities of Australia&mdash;whether they be migrant communities or non-migrant communities, whether they be English speaking or non-English speaking&mdash;want to have circumstances where considerations of such indefinite terms become a matter for courts; where it is a requirement where `hurt feelings' and `injured sensibilities' and the word `offend' become matters for courts. That is what is implied and what is part of the racial hatred legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the incitement to racial hatred and the racial hatred process is deplored by every member of this House, if the government entangles it with such an indeterminate process that with the enactment of this legislation it becomes impossible for a normal citizen to feel safe, and if the government entangles it in a process that has been rejected by the courts of Great Britain and the United States, it runs great risks with the freedoms and opportunities of Australians. Instead of giving freedoms, human rights and equal opportunities, the government is destroying the process that it claims it is standing for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in the same way as the government is able to give extraordinary legal aid opportunities to the member for Fremantle, despite the needs of hundreds of Australians, it is pursuing here an argument that it should acknowledge was wrong in the first place. It should gratefully accept the decision of the High Court that makes the process more sure, more accurate and more exact for every Australian. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It does not take long to get beneath the surface in some of these debates and discover what the attitudes of our colleagues opposite really are to some of these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell suggested that the Labor government is ideologically biased when it sets up these commissions and legislation of this kind. Yes, I am very ideologically biased, and I admit it. I am very biased in favour of equity and equality of opportunity, and I am very biased against discrimination.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell also cast aspersions on the Labor government's commitment to equal employment opportunity&mdash;EEO.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TU5">Mr HAVILAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are very few exceptions, and I will outline them later. The acts to be amended by this bill include the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988. All of these acts have two things in common. The first is that they deal with important areas of social justice: the protection of people from discrimination and the protection of human rights. The second is that, as I have already said, they were all passed by federal Labor governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Racial Discrimination Act was passed by the Whitlam Labor government in 1975. The Sex Discrimination Act was one of a number of landmark acts passed in 1984 by the Hawke government, and the Disability Discrimination Act was passed by the Keating Labor government in the previous term of this parliament. Even the Privacy Act was passed by a Labor government. Like much of the other legislation that covers equal opportunity and discrimination, these acts were passed by Labor governments, and this is the case at both Commonwealth and state levels. There may be one or two obscure exceptions, but I cannot think of them. The only exception I can think of is that the Greiner government, to its great credit during its term in office, passed racial vilification laws in New South Wales. That is the only exception I can think of in this area. This legislation seems to always be the work of Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that reflects the difference between Labor governments and the conservative side of politics. Labor governments believe in social justice, equality and equity of access. We are against all forms of discrimination, whether it be racial or sexual&mdash;any form of unjustified discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equal opportunity act that I am most familiar with through my previous employment is the federal Public Service Act. Section 33 sets out the discrimination that is illegal in Commonwealth public sector employment. I believe that those grounds should be illegal everywhere and, in most cases, they are illegal under our current laws in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of politics, the Liberal Party has opposed many of these pieces of legislation over the years. It opposed the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. It opposed the Native Title Bill in 1993, and we all remember debates about the native title legislation. In fact, the Liberal Party has opposed almost every piece of legislation relating to Aboriginal affairs, including the ATSIC enabling legislation in the early 1990s. It got itself into an awful tangle about the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill last year when the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was the Leader of the Opposition. It is still having problems with the Racial Hatred Bill, which is before the Senate and yet to be passed. The Liberal Party opposed the racial vilification bill, but opposition members are now telling us about discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has two main purposes. The first is to implement some of the recommendations made in the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The initial report recognised the commission's unique role and structure and made a number of recommendations to bring into line various functions of the commission. These have been accepted and given effect to in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act provide that the responsibility for the management of the commission is vested in the commission as a body corporate, with chief executive powers to be delegated by it to an executive director appointed by the commission under the Public Service Act. This means that all powers of a secretary under the Public Service Act will be removed from the Human Rights Commissioner and settled upon the president and commissioners collectively. Importantly, this step will enhance the commission's structure to enable it to properly assume responsibility for corporate functions and to encourage commissioners to act in a collegiate manner in the spirit of promoting the indivisibility and universality of all human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second purpose of this bill&mdash;and it is very important&mdash;is to respond to the consequences of the High Court's decision of 23 February 1995 in the case of Brandy v. the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. In its decision, the High Court ruled constitutionally invalid the mechanism in place since early 1993 for determinations of discrimination made by the commission under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This decision affected all determinations made by the commission since 1993, other than those where the respondent was a Commonwealth agency. I might come back to that a bit later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism for the enforcement of determinations made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988 is similar to that used in the Racial Discrimination Act; hence, it is also invalid on the basis of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. The regime which was ruled invalid was incorporated into the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and into the Privacy Act in 1993. As a consequence of the High Court's decision, there is currently no way of enforcing the determinations of the commission. Determinations which were made before the invalidated regime commenced are unaffected by the decision, as are those determinations in which a Commonwealth agency was a respondent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will ensure that the victims of discrimination are assured of continued protection and will ensure the authority and credibility of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The amendments will reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of commission determinations which operated prior to the enactment of the invalidated scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision in the Brandy case caused a lot of concern in the community and, of course, received considerable media attention. Unfortunately, the decision brought out some of the worst prejudices and the more outrageous pontifications of some of the more rabid, right wing zealots who masquerade as media commentators, particularly in the weekend media. It also sparked the usual pious opportunism from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seemed that the opposition and those right wing commentators could hardly contain themselves and could not wait to jump on the bandwagon and gloat about the damage which they said had been done to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I searched for some of the examples of these outrageous media articles by some of our rabid, right wing commentators that I recalled from the time and I found a couple. The one and only Paddy McGuinness wrote an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I believe in various Sydney papers&mdash;on Saturday 25 February. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one thing to have a properly constituted court, where the judge has a prior record of political activism&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>We have had plenty of examples of that over the years, have we not? He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is another to have a tribunal where ideological commitment and activism are part of its everyday diet, and appointments seem to be merely a continuation of that.</PARA>
<PARA>While, as he said, he was not casting doubts on the integrity of Ron Castan QC, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it does look peculiar to see a person who one day acts as an advocate for particular causes on another day acting as a judge in such causes. This does not look like justice being done, even if it is in fact done.</PARA>
<PARA>I make no apologies for my ideological bias in this matter. I believe in equality. The role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is to ensure that we have equality and that ordinary people&mdash;who are usually the less well-off and the disadvantaged in our community&mdash;have access to justice through such a mechanism and do not have to go through the expensive process of hiring barristers, QCs, et cetera. That was the idea of the commission, and these amendments hopefully will fix that so that those people still have that right. Mr McGuinness also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it surely goes to prove&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the decision&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the rights of everybody, regardless of race, are best protected by real courts.</PARA>
<PARA>We know about that, do we not? Real courts are where you have to pay to have representation unless you can get legal aid. Of course, this once again reinforces the whole problem. Real courts, as Mr McGuinness called them, are not as accessible as they should be for those people who cannot afford to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is usually the case that those who suffer discrimination are individuals such as workers. They are usually people who do not have a lot of economic means and who are amongst the more disadvantaged in our society, whereas the respondents&mdash;the people who are often accused, rightly or wrongly, of discrimination&mdash;are organisations, employers or other more powerful individuals or groups within the community. That is why it is so important to have access to justice through these tribunals and commissions. Mr McGuinness went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But of course the professional advocates of rights tend to become authoritarian in their cast of mind, and they want to impose rather than persuade, punish rather than correct. Thus the upholding of rights easily slides over into a new kind of politically correct oppression and censorship.</PARA>
<PARA>That just goes to show the attitude of the rabid Right, the political Right, in this country towards equality and towards bodies like the human rights commission. They see them as being politically correct oppressors, being authoritarian and being out to punish rather than correct. Of course, that is entirely not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole basis of the legislation we are talking about&mdash;the various acts that have been passed by Labor governments&mdash;and the role of the commission is to educate, to dissuade and to prevent discrimination before it happens, rather than to punish and to get people who are guilty. Obviously there have to be penalties in place, but that is not the main thrust of these pieces of legislation. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it will clearly require a rethinking of the status and operations of a wide range of tribunals that, like the commission, have taken on the forms and behavior of kangaroo courts.</PARA>
<PARA>Heavens above! He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it will force a fundamental reappraisal of the increasingly oppressive direction that the whole human rights and anti-discrimination industry has taken in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA>That reminds me of the redneck comments from Western Australia about the so-called Aboriginal industry during the Mabo debates&mdash;pretty disgraceful stuff, I would put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Then we had Peter Robinson who wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> on 26 February:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first glance, the High Court did us all a favour last week by extracting the quite unpleasantly sharp teeth of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, fancy having a commission that has some clout to enforce some measures against discrimination and to actually protect people! I mean, we cannot have that. Mr Robinson also used the term `politically correct' commission to try to put down the role of these very important social justice and human rights bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That is just a small example of some of the redneck comments that were made in the media after this unfortunate&mdash;although, I guess, understandable in legal terms&mdash;decision by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What does all that say about the debate about human rights and people's access to justice? We are told that people seeking redress against racial discrimination or harassment, or against sexual discrimination or harassment, should have to prove their claims in a real court. As I have alluded to, this is a typical response from those representatives of the privileged and ruling classes in Australia, those who would preserve the status quo and maintain and uphold existing inequalities and the privileges that those people have enjoyed over the years. It implies, not by accident, that to get justice you have to be able to afford expensive lawyers and QCs and have your day in court. This is a totally unsatisfactory situation for those of us with a passionate commitment to equity and social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission were established&mdash;to provide a mechanism for redress for victims of discrimination. In most cases, the complainants are individuals, often employees, while the respondents are employers or other organisations, which are much more able to afford legal representation in court. Hopefully, the amendments in this bill will overcome some of the problems highlighted by the High Court decision in the Brandy case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The commission deals mainly with complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. As I have said, these are all very important pieces of legislation passed by Labor governments. The Racial Discrimination Act was passed in June 1975 during the term of the Whitlam government. Two weeks ago, on 9 June 1995, I had the very great pleasure of attending a function at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne to mark the 20th anniversary of this act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This function was attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who made the keynote speech; the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch); the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus); the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner); and the leader of the Victorian opposition, Mr John Brumby. Other notable guests included the Race Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Zita Antonios; Mr Al Grassby, a former immigration minister in the Whitlam government and former Commissioner for Community Relations; and Dr Kep Enderby, who was the minister responsible at the time of the passage of the act in 1975. I could be wrong, but I did not notice anyone at the function from the federal opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speeches and presentations at this function were thoroughly inspiring. Australia has come a long way in terms of multiculturalism and racial tolerance in the 20 years since this act was passed. This was no better exemplified than by a video&mdash;I think it was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Great battles and small</EMPHASIS> and produced by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;which showed a bit of the history of the drafting of the Racial Discrimination Act and events since that time in this country. It served to remind me of, amongst other things, the reason why people like me and so many of my colleagues on this side work so hard and with so much commitment to elect Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Act is also a very important piece of legislation which, in my previous working life, I had a fair bit to do with&mdash;in particular, section 28 which deals with sexual harassment. Under that legislation sexual harassment is unlawful and employers are liable for the conduct of their employees who might be guilty of behaviour that constitutes sexual harassment in the workplace. In my previous working life, I was an equal opportunity officer in a federal government agency&mdash;</PARA>

One of my roles was to run a program to discourage sexual harassment, to counsel victims and to train staff to be contact officers for sexual harassment. I have dealt with a number of cases and incidents of sexual harassment. I can assure you that it is not a very pleasant thing. Certainly, sexual harassment is amongst the lowest forms of behaviour that I know. That is why this sort of legislation is very important. That is why it is so important to have bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that can provide a strong and fair avenue of redress for victims of sexual harassment, of racial harassment and of all forms of discrimination. To me, that is why this legislation is so important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I did mention earlier that, in these cases, things are slightly different where a Commonwealth agency is involved. I had a case of a constituent who came to see me, a young woman who was and still is an employee of a federal government agency. I will not name the agency or the person at this stage, because there are still matters outstanding. This person had suffered sexual harassment in her employment with the federal government agency and she was not getting very far with the complaints she had raised about it, as often happens in these cases. Fortunately, in the first instance after I managed to raise this through my office with the minister's office, the government agency involved did act with very impressive speed to try to resolve this situation. In fact, as not very often happens in these cases, the person responsible actually ended up being dismissed from the Public Service. That does not happen every day. That appeared to resolve the situation at that level. </PARA>

I caught some of what the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) said and I have just been listening to the honourable gentleman from Macarthur (Mr Haviland). I want to make the point that there very clearly is bipartisan support in this chamber for human rights and social justice issues, but there is not bipartisan support for incompetence. There is a difference. A lot of the argument on the legislation before us at the moment is about incompetence&mdash;not the motives of the legislation, but the fact that it has been mucked up in its execution.

I remind him that the reason for a large chunk of this legislation is not some mythical ruling class in the coalition wanting to impose its standards; it is that the High Court found that the government, which he is a member of, was incompetent in the presentation of its legislation. That is one of the reasons why we are here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is clearly in two sections, if you like. One deals with relatively routine restructuring matters concerning HREOC and the other deals with this problem of enforceability, which a number of my colleagues have already covered some ground on. There is little doubt that we all share the high objectives set for HREOC, but we also need to look at its effectiveness. It is no good just having ideals. You have to be able to give some effect to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the main purpose of this bill is to amend the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, firstly, to allow for the day-to-day management of HREOC to be undertaken by an executive director, who it is anticipated will be a public servant; secondly, to transfer the responsibility of the corporate planning and oversight of the commission's operations from the human rights commissioner and settle it on the commission collectively; and, thirdly, to codify the powers of the president of HREOC, making it clear that he or she is to be the senior member of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to a number of structural changes to HREOC as recommended by the review conducted by the Department of Finance, the Attorney-General's Department and HREOC; in other words, the interim report of the joint review of HREOC which was completed in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation when it was first introduced almost stopped at that point. But it now deals, in its amended form, with amendments that have come to us as a result of the enforcement of the decision in the famous Brandy case in the High Court; hence the change of name from the original legislation to what it is now and the tripling of the thickness of the legislation from the form in which it was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put the legislation in context, perhaps it would be helpful to go back a little and have a look at the structure of HREOC. Through the use of the external affairs powers of the Commonwealth, we have undertaken in this country certain obligations in relation to the protection and promotion of human rights. Those obligations arise in part out of an ever expanding range of international treaties and agreements. HREOC is the Commonwealth agency charged with the responsibility of giving effect to seven of the more significant international instruments to which Australia is a party: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Declaration on the Rights of the Child; the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons; the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons; the International Labour Organisation Convention 111, which is concerned with discrimination in employment; the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which confirms that children are entitled to the full range of human rights recognised at, or by, international law; and the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HREOC started on 10 December 1986. It provides an administrative structure to coordinate complaint handling, advisory and research tasks. Its powers and functions are delineated in four major pieces of legislation: the HREOC Act 1986, which established HREOC and sets out its general functions; the Racial Discrimination Act 1976; the Sex Discrimination Act 1984; and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. In addition, the Privacy Commissioner is a member of HREOC, although the Privacy Act does not confer any related functions on the commission. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is appointed under the HREOC Act, although his or her role is advisory and does not extend to receiving complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the commission has seven members: a president, and commissioners for human rights, race discrimination, sex discrimination, privacy, disabilities discrimination and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice. As I understand it, at June 1994 HREOC had a staff of about 190 and the commission's budget in 1995-96 is approximately $19 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are talking about does not propose significant changes to the powers or functions of HREOC. Likewise, this bill will not directly affect the tenure of existing commissioners or office holders, but it will affect substantially the matter of enforceability of decisions. In broad terms, HREOC inquires into acts or practices that may infringe human rights or that may be discriminatory. In the event that infringements are identified, HREOC recommends action to remove them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members in this place will know, not all has run smoothly for HREOC and also circumstances change with the passage of time. So in August 1993, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) announced the joint review&mdash;which I and others have referred to earlier&mdash;to look at the role, functions, efficiency and effectiveness of HREOC. The review reported in September 1994. I understand that a supplementary study examining the appropriate role for HREOC and its relationship with other bodies is currently in preparation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial report, whilst recognising HREOC's unique role and structure, made a number of recommendations which we have been told have been accepted by the government and basically form the basis for the first part of this bill. The review also foreshadowed a number of matters to be dealt with in that supplementary report, and the Attorney-General mentioned those in his speech today. They include: the ongoing cooperative arrangements with states and territories; complaint handling, including multiple complaints and the possibility of forum shopping; and the perceived need to rewrite all human rights legislation in plain language, which I am sure we would all say, `Amen,' to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the recent Brandy v. HREOC case, the High Court struck down the enforcement provisions for determinations made by HREOC under the Racial Discrimination Act. This obviously came as a heck of a shock to the government. The Racial Discrimination Act had given the commission the power to conciliate complaints of racial discrimination. Originally, this was its only power and, if conciliation failed, an action could be brought in a court for a court order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, however, the commission has been given powers to make determinations that unlawful acts of discrimination have occurred and that the respondent must pay compensation, employ the complainant or perform some other act to redress that discrimination. Such findings are judicial in nature, but until 1992, when amendments were made to the act, the commission was not considered to be exercising judicial power because its determinations were not binding and enforceable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person refused to comply with the commission's determination, then the complainant had to initiate an action in the Federal Court and the matter had to be heard all over again before the court, which would exercise its judicial power and make an order. In some cases, when the matter was brought to the Federal Court, the court would make a different finding from the commission, because different evidence was presented before the court and different rules of evidence applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unsatisfactory nature of the system, which often required a complainant to endure three full investigations, led to an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The commission made a submission to the committee that its determinations should be registered with the Federal Court and take effect as if they were court orders, subject to the ability of the respondent to apply for a review by the Federal Court. The validity of this proposal was supported by an opinion by the Chief General Counsel and the majority recommendation to follow this course was adopted by the government. Legislation implementing these recommendations was enacted in 1992 and came into force in January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994, the legislation was challenged in the High Court in the case of Brandy v. HREOC. On 23 February 1995, the High Court unanimously held that these registration and review provisions were invalid. This was because they breached the constitutional separation of judicial power and executive power. The court held that the legislative provisions purported to give the commission, which is an administrative body, power to make binding and enforceable judicial decisions and that this is contrary to the constitution, which exclusively confers judicial powers on courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of the High Court's decision is that the commission's determinations under the Racial Discrimination Act are unenforceable. As the same provisions apply in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act 1988, any determinations made under these acts will also be unenforceable. Other bodies may also run into similar sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the functions of the National Native Title Tribunal, for example, are arbitral in nature and will not be affected by the Brandy decision. However, one of its functions, which is to make a determination that native title exists, where all parties consent, may well be considered to be an exercise of judicial power and may, therefore, be unenforceable. What all this means is that the immediate problem faced by the government is to amend the discrimination legislation in a manner which will be both effective and constitutionally valid. We have now seen the government's response in this bill by way of amendments to the bill as it was first drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum tells us what the bill is all about. The first few paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum go through a number of effectively mechanical structuring items. I will not go into them because of the time factor, but they talk about the powers of the president, appointing a chief executive officer, corporate plans and things of that sort. But the later parts of the explanatory memorandum go into some detail to explain what has to happen as a result of the Brandy decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum talks about the need to amend a number of the acts I have already referred to because of the enforceability problems. It also talks about the fact that anything that occurred before the changes were made in 1992 is okay. It covers interim arrangements and effectively says that the legislation now before us will actually put us back to the status quo before the new provisions were applied in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have deliberately gone into some detail in spelling out the background to the changes that are proposed for HREOC. I acknowledge, in a lot of the work that I have been able to lay before the House, the efforts completed by the Parliamentary Research Service. However well intentioned, this government seems to have been simply incompetent in this area of endeavour, as it has been, unfortunately, in so many areas where it has had good intentions but has undertaken legislation in a hurry and not really thought through its ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that happens, the trouble is that unscrambling the mess afterwards often causes much more damage and hurt than was caused in the first place. We on this side of the House agree with the amendments. We agree that the amendments provide an appropriate interim solution, and they are not objectionable as such. However, given that the government has been long forewarned of the likely invalidity of the scheme, it must be asked why consideration of a more permanent solution was not looked at earlier. Why do we have to go back to some interim solution while we now take a few more months to look at a long-term solution? The government knew it was coming but actually did not bother to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition did not oppose legislative amendments that altered the operation of HREOC in the manner that the High Court has now found unconstitutional, as we did not want to, at that stage, obstruct its worthwhile objectives. However, the constitutional uncertainty was highlighted by successive coalition shadow Attorneys-General. As some of my colleagues have already said this afternoon, when the issue of HREOC enforcement procedures was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, coalition Senators Vanstone, Kemp and O'Chee dissented from the majority recommendation that was later taken up by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recommended that, where conciliation is unsuccessful in HREOC, the matter should be referred directly to the Federal Court rather than allowing HREOC to make an unenforceable determination. The likely invalidity of the procedures has been raised by legal commentators. In an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> of March 1994 A.J.H. Morris QC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking [the] risk [that the legislation is valid] the Government is gambling with the money and emotional well-being of those citizens most deserving of this protection: namely the innocent victims of unlawful discrimination. It is difficult to conceive of any more urgent instance calling for prompt legislative intervention.</PARA>
<PARA>The previous government speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur, was going on about the need to give people access, the fact that we cannot just have rich men's courts and the fact that those who are discriminated against need assistance. Passing legislation that turns out to be constitutionally invalid is hardly looking after the best interests of those sorts of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brandy decision again raises the question as to the quality of the government's constitutional advice. My colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) mentioned earlier that the government's Chief General Counsel, Dennis Rose, has provided advice that the HREOC mechanism was unconstitutional. The Brandy case is but one in a series of cases in which the High Court has ruled the Labor government legislation to be unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the Labor government's legislation, which the High Court has recently found, at least in part, unconstitutional over the last few years. It includes the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, the Migration Amendment Act 1987, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1981, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Corporations Act 1989 and the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. It is a pretty sorry tale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we must note the situation in terms of the native title legislation. Justice French, as the head of the National Native Title Tribunal, wants it changed because it does not work in a practical sense. But the Brandy decision might well require that that be changed on a constitutional basis as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position on this matter is very clear and very straightforward. The amendments will not be opposed; however, we do criticise the government for not having formulated an alternative plan for immediate implementation, given the likelihood of a High Court finding of invalidity. We are very concerned about the quality of the government's constitutional legal advice. I would suggest that the Attorney-General cannot afford to continue to have major hiccups like the Brandy case, and the others I have mentioned, in his future legislative program. It seems to me that this area of government administration, like so many others, amply demonstrates why we need a new government in Canberra. This government is clearly not competent to carry out its good intentions. </PARA>

What do the citizens do in the meantime? Citizens are entitled to expect that this parliament will produce accurate and constitutional legislation that is reasonably easy to understand. After all, when you are bringing to this parliament legislation that includes penalties of a criminal nature, it would not be a bad idea to let the citizens know when they are breaking the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a situation in Western Australia at this very moment that is a classic example of how this very imprecise legislation called the Racial Hatred Bill might work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of failed cases is an indictment of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, the government went to the High Court and stretched its credibility by using its constitutional arguments before the High Court. I refer to the government's actions in signing overseas conventions, particularly of the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) quoted that authority this afternoon at question time. Most importantly, the government was saying that these conventions gave it special&mdash;and I underline the word `special'&mdash;responsibility to legislate outside the constitutional rights of various state governments. It has caught up with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the list of failures of the government before the High Court is the well-known Teoh case. This was a very interesting case. The arrogant response I got from the minister at the table a little while ago is typical of what happened when I approached Mr Speaker and asked him whether or not our whole structure of responsibility as law makers had gone out the window on account of the original Federal Court decision in the Teoh case. Let me remind the minister of the Teoh case. He does not need reminding. It must be one of the major embarrassments for people in this place who have a legal background. They have been telling us for years that they could go off and, with a warm inner glow, sign these conventions that have no real effect in Australia. In the same breath, they were running off to the High Court and saying, `When the states take matters to the High Court we have an obligation to legislate over the top of state governments. We have an responsibility under the external affairs power because we have made a commitment to the international community.'</PARA>

They did. At the time I said, `What arguments are you going to use this time?' You have been back and forward to the High Court for almost the entire period of your incumbency, arguing your responsibility. Now you want to go back and say, `Not this time, not in Mr Teoh's case.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Occasionally the High Court believes in that and ensures the rights of people are protected. But what was its decision on this occasion? Its decision was pretty simple: the constitution lays down the rules by which people can litigate and by which people can be found guilty of a crime. That can be achieved by applying the proper principles of law, which require that, first, people are innocent till they are proven guilty and, second, there be a proper process in the giving of evidence, which should be subject to cross-examination, et cetera.

Unfortunately, in an attempt to find solutions to the cost of and particularly access to a justice system for all Australians we, the parliament, have taken a bad decision. In fact, the High Court is now coming back to tell us just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation still does not completely overcome the problem. We have gone back to an arrangement which the last amendment, which has been found unconstitutional, tried to change: having a dual court process.

But, if either side is dissatisfied with that, it can go on to the Federal Court. It may as well go to the Federal Court in the first place because all it can get out of the other arrangement is conciliation. Conciliation is something that does not require the structure of a tribunal.

I draw the parliament's attention to one such case. It happened to a person living in Perth whom I know. He owns a licensed premises in Kalgoorlie which has a motel with a bar. He thought it would be a good idea during the local racing round, which is a pretty big event, to put on some entertainers in his bar. These apparently consisted of a musician and two women. They had an act which, I gather without having seen it, was a little lewd.

I do not know, but some of the customers might have called out, `Get yer gear off'. There was a considerable degree of dispute as to what the customers did, but in the tribunal that could not be established because of the very relaxed attitude to the taking of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was quite a bit of argument as to whether or not some of these gestures were as bad as was suggested by the women, but it appears their evidence was accepted because they could not be properly cross-examined. They also claimed some activity went on across the bar which involved a barmaid who was in some rather skimpy attire. The fact is that that particular activity was physically impossible due to the width of the bar; nevertheless, that claim was accepted as evidence. Evidence was given that immediately after the performance and upon complaint by these ladies the manager asked the customers concerned to leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal ordered the guy living in Perth to pay $40,000 in compensation to the ladies. They had not lost any work.

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the amendments. Section 3 of the bill will have effect from 7 July 1994. Item 63 in part 3 of schedule 4 provides for the duty-free entry of certified reference materials. Reference materials are mainly metallic compounds with accurately known compositions which are used as a standard against which like materials and processes are compared and apparatus calibrated. The amendment contained in this bill will allow certified reference materials to be used in a broader range of industrial and scientific processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 operates from 18 November 1994. In February 1994, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from 81 per cent to 94 per cent were wholly of viscose. This decision reduced the government's intended industry assistance rate from 27 per cent to free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this schedule redefine the description of goods for the subject tariff items by replacing the word `wholly' with the phrase `of 100 per cent'. This action will reinstate the level of assistance for goods of mixed fibre content by excluding them from tariff items which require 100 per cent content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 3 and schedule 2 of the bill give effect to the government's decision on the Industry Commission's report on the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries and came into force on 1 January 1995. The overall effect of the tariff changes will be that all imports of unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will be free of customs duty. Manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will still attract the excise equivalent duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of duty, the concessional schedule 4 items 35B and 35C become superfluous and have been omitted. Consequential amendments to item 53A in schedule 4, and to the table in section 26, of the principal act are also necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable members to the joint ministerial statement of 13 December 1994 by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Minister for Trade (Senator Cook), and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), which sets out the main elements of the package of measures taken by this government and the state governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales to assist tobacco growers and manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 also contains an amendment consequential to the world trade agreement coming into effect in Australia. The change is necessary to maintain the intended rate of duty for parts of regulating and controlling instruments of tariff heading 9032 which are not goods of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles. Schedule 3 contains a similar amendment to burglar alarms for the same reason. This change is operative from 1 January 1996. Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the bill to the house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition does not intend to oppose the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 which, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) has just pointed out, is legislation that is of a routine nature. It is a bill that deals with certain adjustments to tariffs including those on textiles and textile articles where it is provided that, where products of chapters 56 to 63 of the Customs Tariff Act 1987 contain two or more materials, the predominant material by weight is to be considered the only material for classification purposes. The note provides that in these circumstances the goods will be treated as being wholly of the predominant fibre. Where there are specific references to actual percentages, these take precedence over subheading note 2(A).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two matters relate in particular to a new treatment for the tobacco industry. That is a matter of considerable debate but seems to be the only solution that is available in the present circumstances where the industry within Australia has always struggled without protection and will continue to do so. There is a note in the summary of amendments which is worth repeating. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 29 October 1993, the Assistant Treasurer asked the Industry Commission to inquire and report on the Australian Tobacco Growing and Manufacturing Industries. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 December 1994, in a joint ministerial statement, the Ministers for Primary Industries and Energy, Trade, and Industry, Science and Technology and the Assistant Treasurer announced the Government's response to the Industry Commission Report No. 39 of 29 June 1994. The statement outlines the main elements of an industry package, which embodies all key measures within a proposal submitted to the Australian Government and the State Governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales by tobacco growers and manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement announced that the customs duty on all imports of tobacco leaf, manufactured tobacco and tobacco products would be free commencing 1 January 1995. This means that manufactured tobacco and tobacco products will only attract the excise equivalent duty.</PARA>
<PARA>In doing this, the government has proposed some assistance measures to the industry. Some of my colleagues might be of the view that these particular measures are inadequate but, on the other hand, the coalition is accepting the proposals. As a result of unmanufactured tobacco becoming free of customs duty, the concessional schedule 4 items 35B and 35C have become superfluous and are omitted. A consequential change is also necessary to the table to item 53A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see there is an amendment related to burglar alarms. If I wanted to take up considerable time of the parliament, I might say that there are other issues relating to burglar alarms that should be addressed. One of those issues is to make an alarm that cannot be knocked to pieces by the fellow who has just broken into your premises before it does its job and alerts the police, or whatever it is supposed to do. I will not go further on that point in this particular technical piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Trade Organisation agreement came into effect for Australia on 1 January 1995. Because of the tariff bindings agreed to by Australia, it was necessary to legislate many phased reductions of tariff rates. These amendments were legislated in the Customs Tariff (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Act 1994&mdash;that is, act 152 of 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As changes made in that act lowered the rate of duty for some tariff subheadings below 15 per cent, importers have been prevented from claiming their intended phased reductions for certain goods which are not of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles. This amendment provides a new tariff subheading 8531.10.19 to allow those purchasing burglar alarms which are not of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles to claim the intended duty rate and the duty phase down to five per cent by 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, these matters are purely of a machinery nature. Whilst I repeat my remarks that in relation to the tobacco industry it is going to cause some hardship for tobacco growers, we acknowledge that there has been some attempt to ameliorate that with some financial assistance between state and federal governments. It will still pose difficulties for those producers and we are hopeful that they will have the opportunity to move to grow other products which will give them a viable financial return. Other than that, there are really no issues arising from these amendments. We give them our support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has said, the amendments in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 cover a range of issues and they are supported by the coalition. They include changes to the duty on crude oil; the duty on avgas for air safety regulation; tariffs on motor vehicles, as outlined by the member for O'Connor; and the arrangements for developing country preference, which are as a result of the World Trade Organisation and the negotiations we entered into as a country as part of our original arrangements under GATT and our ongoing obligations as signatories to the World Trade Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to the question of the changes under the World Trade Organisation, our obligations there and, particularly, the impact of developing country preference that I want to address a few remarks tonight. Initially, in 1993 the government, supported by the opposition, chose to change the developing country preference arrangements that we had with Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines by phasing out textiles, clothing, footwear, chemicals, sugar, canned food, fruit juice and dried fruit from the DCP arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now before the House goes a little further. It includes all exports from the countries I have mentioned, except, as the member for O'Connor mentioned, cheese, unmanufactured tobacco, sugar and replacement components for motor vehicles. I do not have a direct involvement in the tobacco industry and I do not have a contribution to make in that regard, except to say that I endorse the remarks made by the member for O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for the rural electorate of Wakefield, I have a number of industries that are directly affected by the change to the developing country preference arrangements. The industries in my electorate compliment the government for the action it has taken in changing the DCP arrangements, particularly for Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. They recognise that in many cases developing countries&mdash;not necessarily these countries&mdash;have enjoyed a preference that should no longer be extended to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic example of this sort of preference is that extended to the dried fruit industry, particularly the dried apricot industry in Turkey. For a time the Turkish industry enjoyed a developing country preference. The changed arrangements mean that dried apricots now come into Australia on a fairer basis than when Turkey enjoyed developing country status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is important to all the industries that members of this House represent. One of the most labour intensive industries is the dried fruit industry. In recent years, this industry has been faced with a shortage of quality Australian dried apricots. A large number of dried apricots have been used in canning and for juice. There has also been a shortage of quality dried vine fruit, principally because of the surge in the Australian wine industry. This surge in the wine industry has meant that the Australian dried vine fruit market will not be able to satisfy the demand of a number of export markets. As a result there is likely to be an additional import of dried vine fruit, and there has been for some time a growing level of Turkish dried apricots coming into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the developing country preference arrangements have meant that Turkey is now being treated as a trading neighbour and not as a developing country. This change in relation to Turkey reflects precisely what is being done in this bill to the developing country preference arrangements being enjoyed by Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. As the member for O'Connor said, this legislation spells out even more clearly our obligations under the World Trade Organisation and it allows us to meet those obligations. For that reason, the opposition supports this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very conscious of the fact that this particular trading arrangement will make both the government and the opposition rethink their trading policies and obligations under the World Trade Organisation. I refer specifically to the arrangements we are currently facing as a result of the changes in the Australian pork industry and the difficulty Australian pork producers are having in competing with the subsidised Canadian product coming into Australia, principally in the form of leg hams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some concern expressed by the pork industry that the present level of pork imports, while not dramatically high, is growing at a rate that is having a real impact on the Australian domestic pork market. Subsidised pork coming into the country is suppressing the demand for Australian pork and suppressing the price the Australian pork industry can obtain. The arrangements under GATT make it increasingly difficult for us to face the subsidised product coming in from Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the pork industry have expressed a great deal of concern not about the quantity of pork coming in but the fact that it comes in as a subsidised product. It is arriving in Australia at a time when Australian pork producers are facing the increased cost burden for grain for feeding pigs. The increased price for grain has come about solely as a result of the drought. That is something which the member for O'Connor is very familiar with. This increased grain price has simply meant that the costs for Australian pork producers have risen dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, Australian pork producers face increased costs of production, and competition</PARA>
<PARA>from overseas which further depresses the Australian pork market. The pork producers have also sought a reassurance from the government that there will be a change in labelling that will let Australian consumers know that the pork that they are buying is Australian and not Canadian. They are anxious not only to have a change in trading arrangements but also to have a change in labelling laws to enable domestically produced pork to be clearly labelled as such as opposed to the imported overseas pork. This will allow consumers to purchase pork from the Australian domestic market and avoid purchasing that which comes from Canada. The bill before the House deals specifically with the question of world trade and our current trading arrangements and, as the member for O'Connor has indicated, it has the support of the coalition. </PARA>

The leaked documents were the crown jewels of Australian intelligence classified `Top secret', `Oyster', `Austeo' and from ASIS, ONA, DSD, ASIO and the most sensitive sections of the Hope Royal Commission into Intelligence and Security. The then Labor government was so concerned that it sought a High Court injunction at 11.15 at night to prevent further publication of documents. </PARA>

<PARA>It was not. Why not? Can we seriously believe that the combined forces of ASIO and the AFP could not identify the source of the leak of the Austeo papers after an investigation lasting six months? Of course, they could and did. </PARA>

For investigations had revealed that the source of the leaks known as the Austeo papers was a senior DFAT officer, Mr John Holloway. It was Mr Holloway who, in a fit of pique concerning failure to obtain a diplomatic position he sought, passed the Austeo papers to a leading newspaper editor and it was Mr Holloway who had been placed under surveillance by police during visits to two capital cities. </PARA>

They are Kerry Gorski from John Willcock Senior High School in Geraldton and Michael Parnell from the Cunderdin Agricultural College. Michael is a resident of the Perth suburb of Melville. Both Karen and Michael have written short speeches about the area in which they live and/or the school they attend.

Situated in the mid-west, it has a thriving sheep and wheat industry. Due to its proximity to the coast, it is the centre for Western Australia's fishing and crayfishing industry. The famous wreck of the Dutch ship the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Batavia</EMPHASIS> in 1629 has led to the coastal regions surrounding Geraldton being known as the Batavia Coast. </PARA>

The region is well known for its abundance of wild flowers throughout July and August. Many people also visit the area to see the Greenough Hamlet, a national heritage site which comprises restored buildings dating from the first settlers to the area. The high winds that have given Geraldton an international windsurfing reputation are the cause of the remarkable bent trees that one sees in this Greenough region. The annual sunshine and performing arts festivals are held in September and November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Established in 1975, the John Willcock Senior High School has approximately 750 students and was named in honour of John Willcock, who was Premier of Western Australia between 1936 and 1945. The school motto is `enlighten' and the purpose of the school is to develop fully a student's academic, social and personal skills, enabling them to become a more productive member of society. The school caters for years 8 to 12 students who have the opportunity to study a range of subjects. Theatre arts is an important aspect of the school, with a production held for the public each year. The school offers a variety of career pathways, with the introduction of skilling through enterprise programs two years ago. Annual events include participation in WA Country Week where sporting and debating teams are sent to compete with other country schools. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight on Lebanon. Lebanon is a small country far away from Australia geographically but very close to us in our hearts. Over 100,000 Australians are descended from Lebanon and they have come to Australia to make homes and lives and to contribute. Due to great problems in the Middle East, Lebanon, being basically small and defenceless, has been victimised and made the butt of other people's problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, Lebanon is substantially occupied by the Syrian army. The Syrian justification, in their own eyes, is that Lebanon is part of Syria. This claim is rejected by almost every other nation and Lebanon is a country in good standing and legitimacy within the international community. Lebanon is a member of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 July, the Australian government will be reopening its embassy in Beirut. It should never have been closed. I am aware that a fierce civil war raged from 1975 until recently; however, nations cannot turn and run as soon as problems arise. This has caused severe hardship for the citizens of Lebanon. When they have wanted to get visas to visit Australia, they have had to travel to Damascus. Not only did they often incur physical risks, but guards often had to be paid off to ensure safe passage. This situation is intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Israel also has troops in southern Lebanon. This occupation is due to the use of southern Lebanon to shell towns in northern Israel. This shelling was carried out not by forces of the Lebanese government but by Lebanese agents of Iran and other nations in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lebanon itself has never engaged in warfare with Israel or any other nation. The Lebanese themselves are not aggressive or warlike. War has been introduced into their country as a result of various serious political crises that have beset the region for the past 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the reopening of the embassy in Beirut will come the reopening of the immigration department office in Beirut. As I have previously said, all Lebanese migration matters have gone through Syria. This situation was always unsatisfactory and I trust it will not be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite recent carping about immigration, the cold facts are that, without immigration, Australia's population will decline and age very rapidly. Who will pay for the costs of the retirees and who will provide the domestic market? I notice that in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the Australian Bureau of Statistics remarked that the number of those who are 65 years and over will have doubled by the year 2041 and will represent 22 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, the Lebanese have proved to be excellent migrants and their pride in this country is boundless. The reason for this is that we took them in when they were in difficulty and they have repaid the debt with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new immigration office will see a renewed interest in immigration. I recently met Dory Chamoun on his recent visit to Australia. He spoke passionately of his belief that Lebanon as we know it may cease to be a nation within 15 years if things continue as they are. He spoke of the desire of many people, especially Christian Maronites, to leave Lebanon. When I asked what Australia could do to help Lebanon, he said that education and skills training were the very important areas where he felt our expertise could be contributed and very much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to represent an electorate like mine without understanding my constituents' genuine concern for the country of their birth, although they now reside in the country of their choice. The Lebanese who have come to Australia have contributed mightily to our national welfare and if we had more of them Australia would be better off. As any observer of the Middle East will realise, the situation there is very volatile and security is a problem that is very serious for many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The talents of people from the Middle East run very strongly to business and commerce and our Australian business presence in the Middle East, especially Lebanon, is minimal. This is unacceptable and, given our large business community of Middle East origin, it is a mystery. As a matter of priority and urgency, the government must engage more rigorously in commerce with the Middle East. Austrade, an excellent Australian instrumentality, should be encouraged to be more active and more aggressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lebanon is a very modern and Westernised country. The capacity for successful Australian-Lebanese business is very high. We also should be involving more Australians of Lebanese  descent in this bilateral growth. Australia cannot lose by the ideas I am proposing. Australia should be very grateful that so many Lebanese have come here and are available to help us return to the Middle East for commerce and cultural ties. Australia has a great future, but we must build it and we cannot do this without the help of the Middle East and the people of Lebanon. </PARA>

Take your ordinary household, which used to run with such a profit that you were able to buy shares here and overseas and lend money to others. Then within a few short years your house got into such extraordinary debt you could not even pay the interest on the debt. Every month your debt grows and your children are suffering, but you tell them that they have never had it so good.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) has earned herself a spot on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS> without doubt and will probably get the nuttiest speech of the week award. I am here to speak about youth training and labour market programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill in the last sitting week, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) expressed the view that he did not think the youth training allowance was going to do anything for young people, and he was particularly critical about the government's labour market programs. In my speech which followed his, I obviously disagreed with him, particularly on the labour market programs, and cited as an illustration the young people who have been through LEAP, the landcare and environment assistance program, in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the great privilege last week of attending one of many LEAP graduations that I have attended in my electorate. They have all been greatly successful, but this one was of particular gratification to me. In some programs, as with all labour market programs, all training programs and I guess even university degrees, a number of people enrol, start the program and some drop out. In this particular program 11 young people were involved and they were all from the groups known as long-term unemployed or at risk. At the graduation it was a great delight for me to see that 10 of those young people had permanent jobs to go to after six months in that training course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may not think that is amazing, but normally you are lucky if half of those young people get jobs. Others may have training opportunities or other connections that they can build on, or they have gained enough self-confidence to go for something else, but 10 of the 11 young people had received jobs. I thought it was eight when I got up to give my speech, but before I left I was told that two more of them had got jobs. Some could not get time off from their jobs to come to the graduation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular young woman who gave what I thought was an excellent thank you speech on behalf of the students&mdash;she wrote it herself, showed it to the leader of the group and he thought it was fine&mdash;had been unemployed for some time, came from a broken family and had a great deal of difficulties. But she was working and she was proud of the fact that she was working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think LEAP is one of the best labour market programs this government, or even previous governments, has ever initiated for three fundamental reasons. Firstly, it gives young people&mdash;I know it is a cliche to say that young people are our future&mdash;some work training. Secondly, and more importantly, it gives them confidence; it gives them a boost to their self-esteem. I was told that when some of the people first came to the group and had to stand up and say their names and where they were from one of them was so nervous she just rushed out of the room, and there she was at this group&mdash;very confident and very self-assured. The third reason why LEAP is so successful is that it deals with the environment. It is providing job training, self-confidence and helping the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate the environment is extremely important. As most members will know, the area in my electorate covers the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury area. We have the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system, which is in need of a great deal of care. We have national parks, bush reserves and areas that need assistance to regenerate, to remove weeds and so on. Some of the programs that have been carried out under LEAP are under the auspices of Greening Australia. I pay great tribute to Greening Australia as a wonderful organisation that does a fantastic on-the-ground job with the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">LEAP has done such things as removing weeds and creating, out of an absolute mess, a reserve and walking track along the banks of the Hawkesbury River at Swallow Rock Reach reserve. It has cleaned up a lagoon in the Blue Mountains and created a reserve. The latest program that I mentioned created, out of a swamp, a recreational lake with picnic areas and walking tracks. It is a wonderful place for people who live in the Bligh Park area, which is a huge new housing estate, to go to and enjoy themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">LEAP and also REEP, of which this latest project was a part, are highly successful. The pilot REEP project in New South Wales is based in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment. I am very proud that that was chosen in my electorate and several other members' electorates to be the first to deal with that sort of work. I commend the program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)For many years it has been acknowledged that departments rarely have the capacity to deal, in a professional and coherent way, with the range of problems which affect staff and their work performance. Although some larger departments have employed welfare officers/counsellors, this is not a viable or cost efficient and effective option for an agency the size of the Department of the House of Representatives. Moreover, staff often doubt the confidentiality of the services and the welfare officer/counsellor can have difficulty in reconciling his or her management advising role. The Employee Assistance Service was seen as providing effective, cost efficient, responsive and minimum intervention services to staff for work and family related problems. The service also reinforces one of our departmental values that the staff of the department are its most valuable asset.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has pointed out, the Commonwealth Authorities (Australian Capital Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill 1995 applies to Commonwealth authorities that were registered or had application to be registered as employers under state, territory or Commonwealth payroll tax acts prior to 1 August 1987. The bill provides that such authorities are subject to the ACT Payroll Tax Act which came into effect on 1 August 1987, even though their establishing acts may confer a general exemption against state or territory taxation. It provides that, where regulations made pursuant to the act establishing the authority have the effect of making it subject to payroll tax of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, it is subject to the ACT Payroll Tax Act 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to one qualification where we seek further clarification, the coalition is not opposed to the bill. The ACT Payroll Tax Act commenced operation on 1 August 1987 and the bill is designed to make it clear that it applies to Commonwealth authorities as defined in the legislation. As the Assistant Treasurer pointed out, apparently some Commonwealth authorities operating in the ACT paid payroll tax to the Australian Capital Territory government assuming that its payroll tax legislation applied to them, even though they might have been entitled to a general exemption on state or territory tax. The effect of the bill is to preclude them from recovering these moneys.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 of the bill provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Commonwealth authority that has paid tax payable under the Payroll Tax Act 1987 of the Australian Capital Territory cannot recover those payments if they were made before the commencement of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The aim of clause 6 is to protect previous collections of payroll tax by the ACT government and avoid the adverse impact that refunds would have on ACT revenues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is necessary to implement the power of the ACT government to levy payroll tax on these Commonwealth authorities. The bill affects only government authorities and I am informed that no private company would be adversely affected by this legislation. The adverse impact of the revenues on the ACT government, if it had to repay the payroll tax to certain authorities, could be considerable, especially as this is a situation which the current government of the ACT has inherited from its predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If tax were refunded, the ACT would lose, Commonwealth authorities would gain, and no doubt a claim for the reimbursement would in turn be made by the ACT on the Commonwealth. Our query with one aspect of this legislation is with the use of the words `tax payable' in clause 6 of the bill. It may be argued that&mdash;and it has been suggested to us&mdash;although the authorities paid tax, it was not tax payable by operation of law prior to the commencement of this bill. Therefore, a legal question arises as to whether a reference in this bill to tax payable has the effect, which is intended, of precluding the recovery of moneys if it was not tax payable under an authorised legislative instrument prior to the commencement of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to stand in the way&mdash;even if we could&mdash;of the passage of this bill through the House. However, I have raised the matter with the Assistant Treasurer. I expect that it is not a matter to which he can give an immediate answer at this stage. If it cannot be adequately answered, we will seek to ask the Senate standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs to look at those particular words and that particular clause. We share the concern of the government that the bill, which purports that the money should not be recoverable, will be in fact a binding legislative instrument in the sense that it will not be challenged in the courts in any way and that the spirit of what the government intends is carried into operation. Except for the qualification that I have alluded to, the coalition does not oppose this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the opposition supports the Commonwealth Authorities (Australian Capital Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill 1995. It is an important minor piece of legislation for the ACT to guarantee the legislative framework for its revenue base. It makes sense that the Commonwealth, as well as the private sector, should pay these kinds of taxes. In fact, the private sector sometimes complains that Commonwealth instrumentalities are not covered by tax provisions but this legislation will ensure that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is entirely non-controversial and does not deserve debate for more than a moment or two. I would like to use the opportunity to talk briefly about payroll tax in total. Payroll tax is really quite a perverse tax at a time when we have high unemployment. It is a tax on employment. Payroll tax is a discouragement to employment at a time when one of the government's highest priorities, and, I do not doubt, one of the opposition's highest priorities, is to increase employment. We should be aiming in every way possible to reduce or even eliminate payroll tax. Of course, it is a state and territory tax, as is now quite clear from this legislation, so it is not something over which the Commonwealth has direct control. However, the Commonwealth could create conditions under which it was possible for the states and territories to reduce or eliminate payroll tax if other revenue sources were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very speculative to talk in these terms, but it is important to speculate because we have to try to find ways of consistently and comprehensively creating the conditions in which growth of employment could be maximised. The elimination of payroll tax would be a very significant contribution to that goal. In order to eliminate payroll tax, we would have to find some other comparable source of revenue to replace it. It is a major source of revenue for the states and territories but there are other such sources available. If payroll tax were eliminated then corporate tax collections would rise and they would go to the Commonwealth. That would give the Commonwealth the capacity to increase direct payments to the states, which would, in part, offset the consequences of abolishing payroll tax. I understand that that might offset about a third of the loss of revenue but it would still leave about two-thirds to be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way in which that could be done and which has a lot of appeal to me is the idea of the introduction of some kind of greenhouse gas emission tax. That is a complex, even controversial, proposal because it involves issues relating to the incidence of such a tax which have distributional consequences. But if we want to adopt the general principle of taxing `bads' and reducing taxes on `goods' it makes sense to try to tax greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage those emissions and their polluting effects, whilst reducing tax on employment, which we want to encourage. So I think there is a strong case for a more detailed exploration of the possibility of some kind of greenhouse gas emission tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well not be a tax that Australia should do alone. It could well be done in conjunction with other industrialised countries and with developing countries as well. That is on the agenda of the European Community, and it may well be on the agenda of other countries as well in due course. I do not think it is an idea that will disappear. It is one that will continue to be explored because there is so much concern about greenhouse gas emissions and that concern is certainly growing. So this possibility is one that we could well explore rather more thoroughly than happened at the beginning of this year. It is certainly one that I would like to see encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I think it is very important that we absolutely minimise payroll tax. While it is right, of course, to apply it to the public sector as well as the private sector, we should be aiming to reduce it so that employment growth is encouraged. </PARA>

At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to those members of the committee who hung in during the length of this inquiry. It was not easy but I thank them for seeing this report through to the end. I would also like to pay my tribute to Bjarne Nordin and Peta Fitzgibbon for their tireless work during the inquiry and also for their help and guidance so freely offered to committee members. The sheer size of this report would hopefully suggest to those who see it that the committee has come up with a comprehensive and definitive statement regarding this vital issue which now impacts on so many families throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's terms of reference are worth repeating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To inquire into and report to the Parliament on the provision of assistance for homeless youth requiring income support, with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. the availability of family support and welfare services (including mediation services), their role and effectiveness in reducing homelessness and in resolving differences before young people leave home;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. the integration of income support provisions for homeless young people with services that assist with family reunion, transition to stable independent living, and opportunities for education, training and employment; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. the appropriateness of income support arrangements for homeless young people, noting the need to not create undue incentives to leave home or school.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue of youth homelessness is a very emotive one. Stories abound across the length and breadth of this country which highlight the inadequacies of the system which is supposed to strengthen rather than weaken the roles of families in nurturing and supporting their children. The roles of state and federal governments and their various departments have been examined in great detail in this report. Parents, young people and service providers have all given us examples of where the system has failed, and failed dismally. The committee has come up with 129 recommendations for the government to consider. I would like to highlight some of these recommendations and speak briefly to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I would like to say that we are facing two problems: firstly, the problem of dealing with the current crop of homeless young people, and, secondly and to my mind a far more important issue, the way in which we must cut off the supply of potential homeless young people by instituting a range of effective programs across state and federal departments to provide support for families and their children. In our report we cover the whole spectrum of homelessness: the historical development of youth income support, the current services for homeless young people and the current income support arrangements for this group. I do not wish to tackle that in my speech here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to focus on some of the other aspects of the report. I see these areas as the key to really addressing this vital issue. These areas are: the housing needs of homeless young people; family mediation and counselling services; youth and family policy initiatives; Commonwealth-state responsibilities for the care, support and protection of young people; the role of education; and parental roles and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would like to mention the issue of family mediation and counselling services. This is an area in need of vast improvement across Australia, and more so in the rural and regional areas of our country. It really concerns me that our society still has not come to grips with the realisation of the importance of these valuable services and the need for them to be integrated into all aspects of the life of a family. Like most community services which operate in our country, they are poorly equipped to deal with their case load, are underresourced with staff, usually situated away from their client base, and are the subject of disputation between various state and Commonwealth government departments. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note the comments of the Institute of Family Studies concerning an evaluation of the 11 pilot projects for family mediation set up by the Commonwealth government recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study supports the view that early intervention in situations of family conflict may prevent seemingly ordinary problems from escalating into crisis situations and leaving home with little or no support.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General's Department's comments are also of interest:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preventative nature of the adolescent mediation and family therapy program means that it is more successful at reaching those clients who have not already left home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The target population is therefore potentially greater than the number of clients currently receiving homeless rates. Clients attending services are still at home and school and are experiencing difficulties which may eventually result in homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the use of setting up excellent services if they are hamstrung, unable to cope with their case load, and raise expectations within the community only to let these people down through no fault of their own?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nationally we have an expectation that, irrespective of where we live in this great country of ours, we can equitably access telecommunications, postal and educational services. When it comes to health and community services, it is a real lottery. It all depends on where people live. Our recommendations 7.19 and 7.20 are vital if we as a country are ever to develop an effective and responsive network to support all families. Recommendation 7.19 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments immediately establish funding arrangements for the extension of Adolescent and Family Therapy and Mediation Services in a national program as a preventive measure for young people leaving home prematurely.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7.20 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recommends that targets be established for ensuring the establishment of adequate coverage of mediation and family therapy services in all States and Territories within the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that, as well as doing this, we establish an effective linkage between other services offered and operated by the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Attorney-General's Department, the Family Court, and state education, housing and community services departments. At present, there is no such linkage, no effective network, no safety net. There is enormous duplication and an ineffective response to this vital issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of Commonwealth-state responsibilities for the care, support and protection of young people, it was interesting to read the initial knee-jerk response by all states and territories to the release of our report, and more especially to the nine recommendations in this section of the report. Put the states under pressure and they trot out all the defensive cliches to try to deflect any blame. States are hopelessly blinkered into a departmental territoriality syndrome. When it comes to young people, examples of interagency cooperation are a rarity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All states have youth affairs departments, and they are almost exclusively located in the premiers' offices. They are all token efforts, having no effective liaising role, no resources, no clout when it comes to decision making. State and territory governments are responsible for child welfare but, because of Commonwealth involvement in a number of programs for families and their children, the states have sought to relinquish their responsibilities under the claim of fiscal incapacity. Services offered by state governments have been pared to the bone in the name of fiscal restraint and responsibility. Staff in these areas are inadequately trained and resourced and families in need have been extremely disadvantaged. It is interesting to note the comments in the 1989 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report in this area which concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of State welfare and health authorities both to provide appropriate and timely assistance to families in need and to provide appropriate nurture and support to children committed to, and leaving, their care, is a serious indictment on the willingness and capacity of those authorities to properly discharge their legal and social responsibilities . . . The States are ill-equipped or unwilling to offer appropriate services . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing, I would venture, has changed since this damning statement six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now been offered the magic word `protocol'. A federal-state government case management protocol for young people has been agreed to and signed by all parties. It acknowledges a shared responsibility for the welfare of children. It sounds fine in theory, but in practice out there in the real world it is a hopeless mess. It has been operating for close on a year. Our committee members were told of the following concerns in relation to the effectiveness and implementation of this protocol: the inability of state governments adequately to respond to the demands of the protocol in major cities as well as in regional areas of Australia; an increased workload generated by the protocol placing an unmanageable burden on a service already unable to meet its statutory responsibilities to young people; young people becoming further disadvantaged as a result of the cumbersome bureaucratic procedures in operation; the inadequacy of state and territory welfare departments' financial support during the risk assessment period and beyond; the lack of accountability of the states and territories for the actions taken following referral; and, lastly, the failure of the protocol to include access to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of parental roles and responsibilities is the area of our report which produced the most angst from the members of the public who made submissions to us and from members of our committee. Of course it is controversial. When state and federal government policies and programs impact on family relationships and arrangements, of course you will upset some people in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most contentious issues are access to income support and the extent to which it acts as an incentive to young people to leave home, and the supremacy of children's rights over the rights of parents. It is interesting to note that there is consensus between parent groups and community and welfare organisations on a range of other issues dealing with young people. These are: the lack of preventative and early intervention services for families and adolescents; the inadequate support offered to families by state welfare authorities; the lack of responsibility and accountability of both the Commonwealth and the state governments for the welfare of young people receiving the homeless rate of income support; the need to improve and increase the training and the skills of people working in the youth field; and the absence of adequate and accessible family support services for families and adolescents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues and the other issues mentioned today are not barrows which the committee members are pushing for their own political advantage. Unless the Commonwealth and the state and territory ministers responsible for these areas bite the bullet and seriously look at the recommendations contained in our report and work tirelessly to implement them, we will end up with a situation which is evident in many other areas of the world where youth is out of control and where the services are inadequate. The punitive measures which are being forced upon these governments are far more costly and far more divisive than anything that we could ever envisage in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of the committee worked tirelessly to produce this report, and I thank them. It is a bipartisan report with a few exceptions towards the end. I can understand the concerns of members opposite, but we can work together to implement the many recommendations in this report. I trust and hope that the families who put submissions in, the service providers who are working tirelessly for young people and the Commonwealth and state government agencies who have the responsibility to ensure that these programs work effectively will examine the recommendations so that we can come to a sensible and effective conclusion in resolving this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to talk about the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which has recently been tabled in the parliament, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A report on aspects of youth homelessness</EMPHASIS>. I think it is a very significant report and one to which a lot of members should address themselves, if they have a caring position for the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we have a serious problem with some of our youth, although not with all of our youth, because most of our youth are quite well regarded and take their positions in the community. But we do have a serious problem with some of our youth in Australia at the moment. The facts speak loudly. The number receiving the youth homeless allowance has risen from 950 recipients to almost 10,000 in recent times. There are estimates that approximately 40,000 young people are considered homeless. This report investigated these issues and it is quite significant in some of the issues that it discusses and in its recommendations. It does not really try to seek solutions. Rather, it allows for further discussion on the whole matter of youth homelessness. It is a very important issue and is something that we, as parliamentarians, should be considering very urgently because, in my view, we have an urgent problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people have a right to a future and to have some hope in our country, and it is a major problem for a country as rich as Australia to have young people, without much hope and without much future, seeking some respite from their own family home through no fault of their own. We should be nurturing our young people, who are really the major asset of our country. We should be trying to look after them and provide a future for them. Yet we have an estimate that some 40,000 young Australians are considered homeless. I do not think it is because of poor parenting, although I believe that a lot of parenting skills are not inherent: they have to be developed and taught. Perhaps we should be considering the teaching of parenting to classes in the community. It is not that we are trying to protect these young people by institutionalising them&mdash;I do not think we should be doing that either. We should be trying to protect them, giving them some opportunity for the future, some choices that they can be making to provide a future for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report discusses a lot of recommendations. However, there are a couple of things that I should comment on. One is the role of the states. In my view, in most states that we visited, not enough attention is being paid to our youth in this particular area. The particular area of 15- to 16-year-olds is a very grey area of responsibility at the federal level, and at the state level it is very grey indeed. A lot of these people who consider themselves homeless fall into this particular age group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also strongly suggest that we look at early intervention measures. A case recently which related to community services in New South Wales is a typical example. Unfortunately. a young child, six years of age, was beaten by his parents and died. Two weeks prior to this event, the mother contacted community services and asked for help and gave them an early warning signal, but no-one took appropriate action and we lost a young child. In this report we have identified a number of people who asked for early intervention, for some help, and the help was not available. It really is a tragedy, when families in Australia are asking for help to be able to overcome some problems they have within the family, that we are not responding quickly enough. I ask the state governments to review the whole process of how they respond to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Melbourne, I was impressed by a parent who gave some evidence; I think she was from the Geelong area. She spoke of three types of children who are homeless. One type was the child that is abused&mdash;physically, sexually, emotionally or mentally. The second group includes the children who do not know what is going on. To use her description, they have `storms in their head'. They are going through a difficult period of growing and they are not necessarily overcoming some of the challenges facing them. Of course, the third group is those that fraudulently take advantage of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with youth homelessness, I believe, is the perception in the community; and perceptions are reality as it is seen. The perception is that most homeless youth are troubled, they are taking advantage of the system, and they should go home to their parents. I have been to a public meeting and listened to parents quite dramatically and emotionally express their feelings towards government department officers. A lot of parents out there would like to have their children back. But the problem is deeper than people taking advantage of the system. There are children who are abused, and we should be responding to that. There are young people who do have problems with their families. They may perceive problems with their parents, while the parents do not perceive any problems with their children. Some do have these storms in their heads, and some are children who are defrauding the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has a problem in dealing with those three separate areas. It is very difficult to differentiate between them; and when we consider youth homelessness as an issue, too often we try to put all three groups into one bracket. It cannot be done: we have to address them as separate issues. Frankly, this particular report does not have any solutions to that, but it again reinforces the point that this whole issue needs further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I went to a public meeting at which parents were really grieving for their children. They could not understand why their children did not want to live at home, and they could not understand why state departments were not giving information to the parents. One parent explained her situation. She and her family went along to a squat to see her 14-year-old daughter. She had been away from home for about 12 months, and in that 12 months had been raped by some of the squatters in the same place, but she was choosing to live away from home. The mother explained the story quite emotionally, saying how the child's father was on his knees pleading with her to come home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These parents have no solution themselves, but they are grieving. I wonder whether we should be providing some sort of counselling to parents. We talk about mediation, we talk about counselling, and we talk about reconciliation and bringing these people together. But if they are not reconciled, and they will never be reconciled, there do not seem to be any counselling services available to parents&mdash;services they can actually go to and express their grief. It would be like having a death in the family to lose one of your children&mdash;a child you love and cherish. To not have the child with you any more would be like having a death in the family, and there is no counselling to assist that grieving process to take place. At this public meeting, the parents were really emotionally grieving, but there was not any help for them. So not only do we have to consider the future of the children in these particular instances; we should also be considering the parents and the families they leave behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a minority report. Most of my colleagues on this side of the House have supported the report in most of its recommendations, but there are a couple of areas that we have concerns about, and we have expressed those concerns. One is the administration of the whole process, and the other is the abuse claims. There does not seem to be any recommendation within the report about an appeal process for parents in relation to abuse. What we are suggesting is that perhaps that should be available to parents. At the moment, if a child does claim abuse, there does not seem to be any follow-up by any of the state bodies, including the police. I think any abuse should be investigated, because of other siblings who might be involved; but there is no appeal process at the moment for parents to have their day in court, and to discredit any other claims of abuse against them. So we need to look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is a significant report. We ask for its consideration by the government. We ask for the government to respond to a number of recommendations and I hope that it does that quickly. I have had other experiences in this place and on a number of other committees. I have been waiting for some response by the government for over two years on one very important report that I am dealing with concerning another committee. I am asking the government to respond to this particular report quickly because it is a significant report. I hope it is not lost through the election debate that is going on at the moment. If we have an early election, I hope that this report does get responded to in this particular parliament. I think it should because it is quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have mentioned the staff of the secretariat and the way they have handled the whole process of this inquiry. They have been very good at it. They have provided a lot of the information. I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues on both sides of parliament. I think they have been very compassionate in their dealings with this particular issue. It was something that was important for each of the people on the inquiry. It has shown that we as human beings are quite compassionate; we do not necessarily bring politics into our thinking all the time. I think that was shown during this whole inquiry. I would like to commend my colleagues on their attitude to the entire inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I think this is an important issue. It is something that is not going to die. Youth homelessness is a growing problem in the community. It is something we need to address quickly in order to seek some solutions. I ask the government to respond to this report and I ask the state governments to treat it with some sort of urgency as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise as a member who took part in that youth homelessness inquiry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A report on aspects of youth homelessness</EMPHASIS> is a good report because it finally lays to rest the myth that the existence of income support encourages young people to run away. I speak from absolute knowledge that young people are not, and have never been, encouraged to run away. For 10 years I worked in a family group home in Launceston and worked with many young people who could not and should not ever have had to live at home under some of the circumstances they were in. Therefore, the youth homeless allowance is of great assistance to many of our young Australians who often are in desperate and dire need of some support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I noted that it was very good of Senator Jocelyn Newman to write to the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> and alert the people of Tasmania to possible fraudulent claims on the Commonwealth for youth homeless allowance applications. As honourable members know, the allowance is administered by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. One does wonder, however, about the motive of Jocelyn Newman. After all, there is possible fraud going on all over the place where a benefit can be obtained. There are possible fraudulent claims on many public and private institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fraud is a fairly serious business. To make allegations in a newspaper about a possible case of fraud by an unnamed young person is certainly not something to be treated lightly. According to the senator's letter in the 31 May edition of the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>, a conspiracy of teenagers is at work here. Let me quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electorate of Bass has more than a quarter of all Tasmania's YHA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>youth homeless allowance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recipients. I believe this is indicative of a `network' of teenagers who, informed of the benefits available to them (from each other and from school)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I assume she means the information comes from each other and through others at school&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">rort the system.</PARA>
<PARA>DEET figures indicate that almost 400 Austudy recipients were granted the independent&mdash;that is, free of parental income test&mdash;student homeless rate in Tasmania last year. That 400 includes students to 22 years of age, which is the normal age of independence for Austudy. They are not exactly teenagers. The electorate of Bass has 100 students at that rate. There are five electorates in Tasmania so, in Senator Newman's perfect state view, Bass should have a fifth, not a quarter, of the state's share&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JV5">Mrs SILVIA SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tasmania's Austudy youth homeless rate recipients resident in the Bass electorate appear to be consistent with the proportion of the state's 15- to 19-year-olds living there. Therefore, in the study and the report, we discussed what was a homeless student. In the information leaflets for students that we receive from DEET, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You must be living away from home because . . . Your physical or mental health is at great risk because of your family situation. This could be due to domestic violence, sexual harassment, extreme family breakdown or other similar severe situations; your parents are in prison, missing or have a medical condition which means they cannot give you a home or support; you are a refugee . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What is distressing is the fact that the criteria are cold, harsh reflections of the reality that some students face, and I am particularly concerned about secondary age students. That was very indicative as we went around this country and listened to the submissions from people and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The student homeless rate for Austudy is not easy to get, contrary to claims. It is not very easy to get because it has to be administered fairly. The government and the bureaucracy must administer taxpayers' money fairly. I am assured that the responsible department's guidelines, through our studies, require all aspects of the case to be taken into account, with input being sought not only from students themselves but also from parents&mdash;except, of course, where contact could place the student at risk. Many examples of that were given to us. Where possible, reconciliation and continued support from parents, rather than from other taxpayers, is encouraged, as the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) discussed in his statement. He said that reconciliation is a way to assist in lessening the number of young people claiming that allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy manual covering Austudy has 30 or 40 pages devoted to the assessment of the student homeless rate applications. Some of the committee references outlined the fact that there was no real case to be borne that public servants were not administering the policy and the correct guidelines as set down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of work involved in this issue. It is very sensitive and public servants also know that, with every grant or rejection of the independent rate based on extreme family circumstances, someone's nose is going to be put out of joint. What showed up through the report and the undertakings throughout the country was that, in general, everyone who was involved was bipartisan. It is rather a shame that certain people easily whip up something that is very sensitive into a greater issue without taking into account the fact that we need to look at it carefully to make sure that all our young Australians, who desperately need our guidance and assistance through allowances or subsidies, are looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case that I mentioned that was cited by Senator Newman represented the classic low act. I do not think anyone who publicises the fact that they are representing a particular person in need does that individual a favour. No rort was shown to have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the committee invited submissions, because Senator Newman actually felt so concerned about it, we would have hoped that she would have raised those concerns with the committee, but unfortunately she was not able to be in attendance at any of the hearings. We had a very good hearing in Hobart where some 11 individuals or organisations turned up and told us in no uncertain terms of the situation in Tasmania. I was advised that Senator Newman's letter in the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> appeared only a matter of a few days after she wrote to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), so there had not been enough time for a reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the committee looking into youth homelessness, I found it rather disturbing that a single case in the northern part of Tasmania, in my electorate, had been publicly discussed and had not been brought to our committee for discussion. I and no doubt every other member of the House would agree that Austudy should not be made available to students who simply are not getting on with their parents, or to students who are rorting the system, or to students who are fraudulently claiming circumstances which might qualify them for Austudy. I hope that every member would also condemn the way in which any other member would use this issue to promote suspicion and distrust of the way that student assistance is being administered. That is there to help the young homeless people to continue their lives and to help them continue their education. From past experience in working with those people for 10 years, I know that they have often found themselves in appalling and disgusting circumstances at that stage of their life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a good report. It recognises the sensitivity of these situations. It places a great deal of emphasis on case review, which itself will go a long way to foster reconciliation where possible. Most importantly, this report calls on the states to play their roles and to accept their responsibilities on these issues. The Commonwealth is essentially the financing agent for the program and is not equipped to play the enforcement role. The Commonwealth-state liaison must be addressed to achieve increased efficiency in delivery of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also deals with children under 16 being referred to refuges as step one rather than receiving the benefit. These are sound and well thought out recommendations to deal with a very difficult and a very sensitive problem. This report represents a pro-active approach, unlike writing to a local newspaper in an endeavour to score some cheap political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I close, I would also like to pass my thanks to the chairman of the committee, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), who is present, and to all my fellow committee members. A special thanks also must go to Bjarne Nordin, Peta Fitzgibbon, Lynette Sebo and Jodie Williams from the secretariat for their hard work, assistance and guidance. It was certainly much appreciated. I would also like to publicly thank the 19 individuals and 130-plus organisations, 11 of those from Tasmania, who took the time to offer their submissions to the committee. I would like to say that their thoughts, their ideas and their suggestions throughout those hearings were much appreciated. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report from the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on aspects of youth homelessness has in fact been tabled in the House and I have spoken on it in the chamber. This morning I just wish to add a few comments to the remarks that I had made that day. As we know, times for consideration of reports are short and this report is in fact very long. The report contains 129 recommendations. I touched on some of those in my earlier remarks, and I would like to go to a few more of them now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one I want to touch on is the fact that many people in submissions raised the question of some form of temporary payment for young people who are homeless or being evicted or being left stranded in traumatic circumstances and then it taking a substantial time for them to find some form of support. That is certainly a serious issue that we should be aware of. But at the same time there was a concern that that may well lead to frauding or to the allowance and support being diminished or demeaned in the minds of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore recommended that the applicants should be dealt with very quickly. In other words, if the government could not respond within a day or a day and a half or so of an application, that was the government's fault and not the applicant's fault, remembering that in the report we recommend that all such applicants should have face to face assessment by a professional social worker and that it not be done by telephone or some other form of correspondence. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended therefore a probationary period for the allowance, so that within six weeks of the first payment being given the department would be required to review whether that payment should be sustained, and the review would be required to be substantiated with a case plan. I am not wishing to use the words `case management' there but `case plan' to make sure that we have taken into account the person's circumstances: home life, relationship with families, schooling and accommodation. So rather than simply granting an allowance and leaving it at that we recognise that the money is not usually the major problem; it is very often the other aspect, the support, that a young person needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first six weeks is the best possible chance for reconciliation with families. In that context the other raft of support measures such as extended families comes into play. A young person being fostered by a stranger is giving more support to that family than if it is some relation. In other words, we may well be able to find in that first six weeks, in that probationary period, alternative arrangements that offer more than money but rather offer support for that young person. That probationary period is a fundamental shift in concept because it indicates to the young person and to the family that the payment is not a permanent process but rather a means towards establishing a better long-term circumstance. That long-term circumstance may well be independent living or it may be reconciliation. There is a range of choices. The way that it has operated to date has been very black and white: if a person receives a payment, someone is making a permanent judgment about him or her and/or the family, and that is not helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going further in terms of the alternatives available, the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) spoke just briefly about refuges. The fact is that as a government, with the agreement of state governments, we do not allow special refuges for young people under the age of 16 years. We accept that they can go to a youth refuge as a matter of crisis or a matter of urgency, but we do not accept that refuges are solely for under-16-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That really does pose a major problem. What we are facing around Australia is effectively a lack of alternative care. We were told by state departments that adolescents of 13, 14 or 15 years age who may have had behavioural problems, who may have had problems at school, who may have had problems with family breakdowns, are hard to foster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, with the reduction in the number of state institutions&mdash;and institutional care is not the appropriate form anyhow&mdash;we are finding a very big gap in community support. Refuges are not a good place for young people to go to. The age group for youth refuges is notionally 12 to 14 years of age, so we may have a 13-year-old or 14-year-old who has just left home under extremely traumatic circumstances in a crisis situation housed on a temporary basis with young offenders, people in their early 20s in very difficult circumstances. In the same way as gaols are not necessarily a good place to send people for relatively minor offences, the refuge situation is not advisable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That point of view came through from the whole community. Refuge workers were telling us that they should not be taking in 16-year-olds and 14-year-olds and 13-year-olds because it is not an appropriate environment. So we have suggested that the state and Commonwealth governments should explore an alternative form of SAAP which focuses on younger people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some form of community living, where people can live in a community context but with a home style environment, is required. Some states have played with the idea of community housing but, quite frankly, we could not find enough examples to justify using them as a model. They were too discrete and too narrow, if you like, for us to say that they would be suitable across the country. At the same time as we had the Commonwealth and states saying that they would not have SAAP accommodation solely for under-16-year-olds, which is an acceptance of the fact that it is not appropriate, we had the refuge in Western Australia that I mentioned where five of the six young people staying there were under 16. In other words, five-sixths of them were under 16. The reality is that an enormous number of young people are going into refuges because they have nowhere else. There is a desperate need for SAAP to be refocused. The report strongly urges the state and Commonwealth governments to review that situation and to perhaps look at some SAAP accommodation services that would be for under 16-year-olds but different from what we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that we need to perhaps emphasise more strongly is the question of psychiatric illness, its prevalence and how it is treated. The report quotes the evidence of Professor Kosky, who was an extremely valuable witness to the inquiry. He had a great deal to offer in this area. He pointed out that about half of all psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed by the age of 19 and that the median age for half of those diagnosed mental disorders is 16 years. The under-20 age group receives about seven per cent of the funding. Adults make the decisions about the budget but it is that younger age group where there is an enormously high level of psychiatric disorders. The budget that goes towards that group is in fact is very low and quite disparate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, with the deinstitutionalisation of psychiatric institutions that has been occurring, we are finding fewer and fewer resources available. The capacity for youth workers to diagnose whether a person has a behavioural problem or a psychiatric problem is minimal. There is no training available. These youth workers are not trained in that way. In fact, in the Northern Territory, we found that there are no psychiatrists, so people could not be diagnosed. There is a failure by governments, state and federal, to recognise that psychiatric illness is a major issue with young people. The illness is both undiagnosed and untreated. It is certainly that group which provides the major source of homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Kosky also made the very valid point&mdash;I do not think anybody else raised it&mdash;that, in many cases, a young person with a psychiatric problem, which may be developing even before they reach their teens, will be seen as having a behavioural problem. Because the illness happens gradually and develops over time, the family will accommodate it and it often leads to a family breakdown. So, rather than the homelessness being a result of family breakdown, the family breakdown may be a result of a psychiatric illness that is not diagnosed. The parents, the family and teachers see it as a behavioural problem. They see the child as being wayward, undisciplined, uncontrollable, all of those terms that we use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Professor Kosky pointed out that in many families one parent will often take the side of the child and the other parent will not. It is that difference which often breaks up the family itself. Undiagnosed psychiatric illness of some young Australians is leading to family breakdown, which, in turn, leads to homelessness. Lack of perception and understanding of that is a major problem. This whole area is ignored. So when we talk about training our youth workers we are not talking simply about training in counselling. We are talking about training in recognising that a young person may not have a behavioural problem but may have a psychiatric problem which, if treated and dealt with, may mean that person can be restored not just to the community but to his or her family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to touch briefly on a couple more things in the short time available. The first one is the question of schools as a place for early intervention and early recognition of a young person&mdash;and, in many cases, a family&mdash;experiencing trauma. It has been raised with me that teachers are trained to teach people, and that is certainly the case; but teachers are also very aware when their students are in difficulty or their performance changes dramatically over a short time. The fact is that in most cases they have no-one that they can refer to, because our systems are so caught up with crises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to see is a much closer partnership between the education system and the community services sector&mdash;and, in some cases, the health sector&mdash;so that when a teacher perceives that a pupil is in difficulty there can be a very quick response at that very early stage. The way to address this problem is to try to prevent it occurring in the first place. Homelessness is not always preventable, but it certainly can be diminished from what it is now. That would require intervention and family support much earlier than we currently have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the vehicles that we propose in the report is the use of the auditing provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. That is being put forward as a vehicle for premiers and prime ministers to start to look at policies on children and the family as one policy&mdash;across, between and within governments. Within any one government we may have five or six ministers and departments all covering this area. In the states we have health, education and community services and juvenile justice departments all involved in some way. When looking at state and federal ministers combined, we may have 30 or 40 ministers involved, and their areas are treated as separate issues. We are arguing that there should be one policy within each government&mdash;one policy for each state government and one policy for the federal government&mdash;and they should be coherent. Rather than it being the responsibility of junior ministers and a junior part of their portfolios, it should be seen as being a problem for premiers and prime ministers as a major national focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put those structural changes forward because they really do need talking about. This report is not the end of the story: it is a vehicle for consultation and discussion. I expect that in the next few months the youth sector and the community sector across Australia will start to talk about this issue in a different way. We have tried to produce a report that they can work with and work their way through. I am urging governments of all persuasions and at all levels to listen to that debate, to listen to the community, and to watch their response to this report. The report may not have all the answers, or even the best answers, but it is a vehicle to help find some of the best answers for the sake of those 22,000 to 30,000 young people. They need much more than simply reports; they need some actions. </PARA>

This report is tabled by the committee, but it belongs to a lot of people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for this particular inquiry, but I am interested in training programs in Australia, particularly in the vocational education sector of Australia. It is for that reason that I took an interest in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A best kept secret</EMPHASIS>. That is an excellent title for this report, because training schemes in Australia do not have a high profile with the general public, but they do very effective work within the community and their role is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference was to look into improving small and medium sized enterprises' participation in, and access to, the training market, including Australian vocational certificate training, and training services that could be offered. It is very important that we are aware of how we can actually improve small and medium sized business enterprises in their training. The big companies in Australia are able to do this because they have the resources, the personnel and the financial facilities. But the small and medium sized businesses do need expertise and they do need skills in their particular businesses. Australia does have to work out how best to ensure that our young people&mdash;and sometimes not so young people&mdash;are given the opportunities to upgrade their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is particularly to the fore at the moment in Tasmania. I know of a couple of medium sized engineering companies and one of them feels that it may even have to relocate to somewhere else in the world because it cannot get the skills from the work force that is presently there. That problem is in relation to building the big catamarans in Tasmania. The demand for building more of these large vessels has created a demand for skilled people. But within Tasmania and, the company thinks, within Australia there are not sufficient people skilled to undertake these projects. That is a concern for a country like ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group training schemes in Australia are very well placed in that regard because they enable small and medium sized businesses to take on apprentices or trainees&mdash;which are the two areas the schemes cover&mdash;and, if a particular business has a downturn, the person can be slotted into another enterprise but their training or apprenticeship can be continued. Once upon a time, the situation was that an apprenticeship was indentured to a particular company or person and if that person's business went through very difficult times and the apprentice or trainee had to be put off, they were left in limbo. Quite often that happened to many of our young people. So the group training schemes, which have actually been around since about 1981, came into being so that we could try to create a situation for training our young people without them running into the possibility that the business they had gone into was unable to see them right through to the end of their training or apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group training scheme is an excellent way of meeting the ups and downs of industry, of small business and medium sized businesses, but at the same time ensuring that we have a mechanism for training skilled people. This report really does underpin and give new impetus to group training schemes and I am pleased to be able to make a few comments about it. It is very important that we have this sort of structure in Australia so that, as we go through adjustments in the economy, there is flexibility to maintain a training base at the apprenticeship and traineeship level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue discussed in this report is that of links with schools. At this stage, there are not good links with the schools in regard to training. I believe that within Australia there needs to be a restructuring in regard to our schooling and training, and in how ANTA operates TAFE colleges. This raises the question of the division of our schooling system into primary, secondary and college sectors. This is a historical division and I do not believe that it is any longer appropriate for our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report alludes to one of the difficulties in regard to training: the lack of contact in Australia between training mechanisms and schooling. If we looked at this area more thoroughly, we would find that the division in educational terms probably should come at the end of year 8, instead of at the end of year 6. We need a new grouping, a new way in which we operate our schools, such as a segment from year 9 to year 12, or even from year 12 to year 13. Perhaps there should be educational institutions which run from year 9 to year 15, with diploma courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a linkage with training now, particularly from year 9 to year 12. Many of our young people who are going on to apprenticeships or vocational education are in schools in year 11 and year 12. They do not want to go on to university, but they do want to start to develop their skills in a particular vocational area of interest, long before year 13. This report does give some indication of a greater need for linkages for some of our students. I believe that those linkages should run, in particular, from year 9 to year 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great need. Those schools which are involved at these stages say that there is a lack of the support and funding required to bring about this adjustment. On the one hand, there is ANTA, which funds the technical and further education colleges and training institutions around Australia, but on the other hand there is a lack of interface with the schooling sector. This report alludes to that deficiency in its overview and recommendations, when it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of links between schools and work places is a key component to the success of the Australian Vocational Training System.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to underscore that. There is a need now for the articulation of linkages between our schools and the training system. The third point I wish to raise is that the committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are grounds to question the value of short non-accredited and non-articulated vocational training courses which were developed without extensive input from prospective employers.</PARA>
<PARA>There are large numbers of our population, mainly young people, who are in training programs which are non-accredited and non-articulated. Frankly, most labour market programs of that type lead nowhere. We are deluding many of the people who go into these training courses. They know that it is tough out there to get jobs and they believe that those courses will lead to reasonable possibilities of employment. In fact, there are probably hundreds of people who are already more qualified in those particular vocations than those who do the non-accredited and non-articulated vocational training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report highlights once again the lack of reality there is in our spending, as a nation, a lot of money on courses which lead many of our young people nowhere. I think many of us know that out there in these labour market training schemes there are people who have done course after course and are becoming pretty disillusioned because the courses mean nothing. They mean nothing to employers, in particular. Ultimately, the people who have done them see them as irrelevant and worthless. What I would encourage the government to ensure is that all training courses are in some way accredited and lead on to further courses. A labour market training program or course, even if it is for only 10 weeks, should in some way be articulated to and linked in with either a certificate course or a diploma course. It should not be a dead-end training scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we are, essentially, only conning people who get involved in these training schemes. What they really need to be given is courses which are accredited. If we are going to have a successful Australian vocational certificate scheme, all our resources involved in training need to be directed into the types of courses which do have a genuine standing in the community, and particularly with employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report highlights the need, when we are talking about training in a whole range of industry sectors, to know where industry is going. There has been a problem with training in Australia, in that the people doing the training have often lagged behind in knowledge of where business is headed. I think that is one of the reasons why there is a lack of skilled people in certain sectors within Australia. In that sense we need to move particularly to a much more market orientated training system, as I believe is the present view of the board which runs ANTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group training schemes in Australia are involved with 14,000 or so people at the moment. About 13,000 of those are apprentices and about 1,200 are trainees. They fulfil a vital role in the training sector within Australia. To ensure that they continue to do that I would support the recommendations in this report that there is a need for core funding to these organisations to be maintained so that they can plan and know that they are secure. They are a flexible arrangement which ensures that training and apprenticeships can be ongoing, irrespective of the downturn of particular businesses, so that people can be moved around. That is vital. There are always going to be adjustments in the Australian economy, across a whole range of different vocational areas. Group training schemes, as this report states, are ideally suited to ensuring that we have a trained work force. Therefore, I commend the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and someone who took part in the development and finalisation of this report, I would like to start off by thanking the other members of the committee for the work that was done. A range of members put quite a bit of time into this report and I think the results are there in the recommendations and in the report itself. I would like to thank the secretariat of the committee, John Cummins and Lorraine Ball in particular, for the many hours of work that they put into the construction and development of this report. The work that they have done has been a significant consideration in coming forth with a report which is very extensive and comprehensive and gives a coherent approach toward what may happen in the future with group training&mdash;which, as the report says, is Australia's best kept secret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say a little bit on group training. As has been mentioned by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), it is a uniquely Australian system. We were unable to find evidence elsewhere in the world of a similar system. It has the capacity, when working correctly, to work into industries at all levels and particularly to develop training programs which are appropriate for small and medium sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of June 1994 there were 104 group training companies across Australia and they employed approximately 13,000 apprentices and 1,200 trainees. The companies operate on an industry or a regional basis in both rural and metropolitan Australia and across a range of industries. It is interesting to note that, although apprenticeship numbers across Australia during the 1990s fell by 22 per cent, during the same period group training apprenticeships increased by 28 per cent. In a situation where the market share was falling, the group training system was obviously doing something right in terms of its share of the market increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry group training companies operate in a range of sectors, for example, the automotive, retail, housing construction, electrical engineering, plumbing, finance, manufacturing, hospitality and local government sectors. The group training company acts as a broker and an administrator in the operation of apprenticeships. Many businesses are not large enough financially to sustain an apprentice in their own right and the administrative and other costs which relate to developing an apprentice are difficulties for small businesses. Often there are situations where particular industries are facing downturns. The circumstances this year may be such that a construction firm can afford an apprentice but the circumstances next year may be such that the firm cannot afford an apprentice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These circumstances create a number of problems for the apprentice. Occasionally an apprentice is midway through an apprenticeship and he or she loses the apprenticeship because of a downturn in the employing industry or company. This situation results in a loss to the nation in terms of the investment of education and training in the apprentice. The investment can be jeopardised or lost because of downturns in particular industries. Downturns in industry affect not only the personal situations of the apprentices involved but also the trained work force and the investment that Australia makes in its young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group training companies are able to rotate apprentices to industries where work is available. The committee was informed of occasions in the construction industry where, for a period of time, it may be necessary for the group training company itself to take apprentices on board in order to keep their heads financially above water until the industry improves and until opportunities are available for the apprentices to continue their training. In some circumstances, rotation results in a better rounded apprentice and, eventually, tradesperson; a tradesperson who is able, on occasion, to move from employer to employer, and, therefore, to become more aware of different aspects of their industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee held hearings on the Gold Coast in Queensland and members of the committee were able to speak with people from the construction industry. An example was provided to the committee that an apprentice who works with one carpenter may become an expert at hanging doors or an expert in other aspects of the construction industry. In the process, that apprentice will obtain a broad understanding of a range of other issues. The apprentice will develop significant expertise in particular areas, but not in other areas. Through the group training approach, it is possible, on occasion, for apprentices to move from tradespeople who are working in particular aspects of an endeavour to tradespeople who are working in other aspects. Tradespeople are better tradespeople at the end of the process. They are better able to make their living and they are better able to contribute to the economic wellbeing of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another important issue about group training. Group training companies perform a pastoral care role in respect of their apprentices and trainees. The young people who go into apprenticeships are usually only just out of school. This employment may be their first paid employment and there can be a range of teething problems during their adjustment from school to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff are available to assist with any problems that may occur in group training. Hopefully, they would be able to address problems which may develop in a young person's life which may jeopardise their capacity to continue with their apprenticeship and, in that way, improve the circumstances for a successful completion of that training and for transition  to employment from education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the overall situation, training, diversity and independence are hallmarks of the group training companies. In that way they are able to adapt to circumstances better than in a number of other training programs. They are able to react to the needs of an industry and to the needs of a region much more quickly than many other forms of enterprise and ensure that they maximise employment and opportunity for the people they serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that came out through the inquiry is a concern that there is a lack of knowledge of the real importance that group training plays. Hence the title of the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A best kept secret</EMPHASIS>. One concern the committee did note and has asked to be acted upon in its recommendations is the need to further develop the concept of group training and the publication of that throughout the community. There are something like 30,000 small businesses which presently access group training, but in the region of 10 times that number of employers in the small and medium sized businesses are not aware of it, or do not access it but certainly could if circumstances allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, there is a capacity for a lot more employment to be developed out of this process and for a lot more valued and experienced trades people to develop. That scope ought to be used. Group training essentially has a community based structure in terms of its committee of management and it works very closely with industry in its area. In that way it is able to develop good quality programs in the local area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that the committee looked at was the question of links between schools and workplaces. There needs to be more publication of the value and opportunities of group training within the education sector. In that situation we mean particularly secondary schools but, also, to an extent, technical and further education. It was apparent from the committee's hearings that there were quite a few schools which were not availing themselves of the opportunities and, therefore, not highlighting those opportunities to the kids who were coming through their system. That is a shame because there is a lot more capacity for things to be done in this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Braddon talked about labour market programs and effective pathways in training. That is an issue which government as a whole has recognised is a concern and has tried to address in recent years. Certainly the development of the AVTS is about that. It is about developing pathways and having a situation where training&mdash;whether it be through TAFE, secondary school or through labour market programs&mdash;is designed to lead to qualifications that are real, are of value and can assist people to move into employment. A range of the changes that government is implementing at the moment is all part of that and should ensure that the results sought come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which was mentioned was core funding for group training companies. This concern was raised with the committee because of the great variation in the balance sheets of group training companies. We had circumstances where some group training companies had very significant financial assets while others did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that also came through from the hearings and the evidence taken was that there was a great variation in the level of accounting standards applied at various group training companies. The government has recognised that it is important that core funding be maintained and that essentially, although group training companies in some cases have moved into other forms of labour market programs and training and development, and that that is something that should be encouraged, the focus should still be on apprenticeships, in particular, and traineeships, and that in those circumstances core funding is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recognised that sometimes there are very important reasons for the variation in financial balances according to group training companies. For example, a group training company operating in the building industry&mdash;an industry which is renowned for its highs and lows&mdash;can, more than most other industries, be facing the situation of having a number of apprentices in difficulty and needing subsidisation over a period of time until they are able to get employment elsewhere. In those circumstances, that larger financial balance sheet is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of what companies do with those financial assets is also important. We saw numerous examples of group training companies endeavouring to be innovative and intelligent about the use of those financial assets and trying to maximise the bang for the buck. That also has to be looked at. However, there needs to be an improvement in financial standards within group training companies. There needs to be a lot more detail and commonality in terms of statistics gained from those group training companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here with group training companies is a very good initiative. It is an initiative that can be improved on. What it requires is more information as to the success that is out there and the capacity to be able to use that information in a way which benefits group training companies in terms of their initiatives, and which also benefits their target groups. By their target groups, I mean both the apprentices, potential apprentices and trainees out there, and also the businesses which they play an important role in serving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is the question of best practice. We saw great variations in what group training companies do and how they do it. On some occasions, as I mentioned earlier, the circumstances of a particular industry or, for that matter, a particular region may justify the difference in the results that are achieved. However, I certainly took the view&mdash;and I think other members of the committee did too&mdash;that there were best practice stories out there that needed to be highlighted and that needed to be passed on to other group training companies in the area. In that way, we could develop a better system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which I had some concerns about during the inquiry was the placement of group training companies throughout Australia. It was apparent to me that there were some group training companies which had areas which were too large for what they were actually endeavouring to do. In that way, there were gaps in the overall regional coverage of the system. There were also gaps in terms of areas where group training companies were not allocated. In those circumstances, when we are looking at the establishment of more group training companies&mdash;and that is certainly something that should be considered&mdash;we must be very conscious of those gaps, we must endeavour to identify them, and we must ensure that resourcing is committed where it is really needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish where I started and once again thank the members of the committee, including the member opposite, the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), who played an important role in the development of this report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A best kept secret: report on the role and effectiveness of group training companies</EMPHASIS>. As the report's title says, group training has been, up to now, our best kept secret, but with the tabling of this report it has now become an open secret. I think the whole system that we have looked at is indicative of the unique way that we do things in Australia. As the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) said, we cannot just rest on our laurels and let things happen willy-nilly. This is a good model and it needs to be refined so that it can go on to deliver further forms of training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that it is indicative of the unique way we do things in Australia, that is not to say that group training schemes are out of the woods, so to speak, in terms of their long-term security, or that they have a perfect structure. It is a matter of continuing improvement. Equally, it can be said that the organisation has a lot more to offer in structured training as a partner with government and as a conduit for delivering training to neglected areas of enterprise, such as small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, its multi-disciplined approach across a wide range of enterprises and trade sectors gives the scheme the opportunity to set standards of world's best practice in the area of vocational training. It is a concentrated group with a national structure and, through it, the government can channel best practice methods into training. It can become a leader. Its structure is such that it can set these new standards and methods of delivery not only in group training but also in refinements of that such as competency based training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke briefly on this matter when the committee's report was tabled in the main chamber, and I welcome this opportunity to expand on my views in this debate. I should declare that this is a movement very close to my heart. I do not have a conflict of interest in this, but I suppose I do have a profound interest in it as I was a founding director of a group apprenticeship scheme in the infancy of the organisation. I have seen it grow from one employee and a handful of apprentices, in my own area, to a scheme of 180 apprentices in Bundaberg and 130 apprentices in Gladstone in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the height of the recession, the organisation had been on the brink of potential failure only to bounce back through singular effort on the part of the manager, staff and directors. I have seen how demoralising it is for a team of voluntary workers to be threatened with the withdrawal of state and federal core funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important aspect and I would like to touch on it. I am glad that the report deals with this in some detail. I will mention one of the instances that occurred at that time. There was a group training scheme, which can remain nameless, which was receiving $180,000 from the state and federal government. At that time, the scheme, with about 150 employees, was returning $540,000 to income tax collections. So, if we take $180,000 from $540,000, the public purse, be it state or federal, was $360,000 in front. Some schemes at that time were threatening to close. Had that scheme or a scheme in similar circumstances decided to close, the cost to government of the dole would have been $900,000. So, on the one hand, we would have had a profit to the public purse of $360,000; on the other hand, there would have been a loss of $900,000. The difference to government would have been $1.2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is multiplied by the 50 or 60 schemes that were around at the time or by the 104 schemes that are around today, one can see the extraordinary potential that group apprenticeship schemes have not only in creating jobs and delivering vocational training but also in assisting government in removing the curse of unemployment and removing young people with skills from the dole queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group training is delivering about 11 per cent of Australia's apprenticeships and, in my own state of Queensland, it is as high as 15 1/2 per cent. In my own area, the Wide Bay, Central Queensland part of Queensland, at times the figure has been as high as 30 per cent. It could be said that, in the general area of my electorate, at times, nearly one-third of all the structured vocational training has been delivered by this scheme. As the honourable member for Corinella mentioned, the committee visited my electorate and I was happy for it to inspect works at three places&mdash;Bargara, Bundaberg and Gladstone&mdash;and we saw excellent work being carried out by BACAS, the Bundaberg group apprenticeship scheme, and GAGAL, the Gladstone scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both organisations have bid for and received substantial housing projects from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning in Queensland. That is very much to their credit and it is hoped that will continue. Most of the schemes across Australia rely very heavily on the building industry in one form or another. If this is not to continue or is to be cut back because of the rise in interest rates or&mdash;to introduce just a small political dimension to this&mdash;the 12 per cent on building materials, I hope it does not impact on these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Bargara, near Bundaberg, and at Wattle Grove, in Sydney's west, we saw another interesting dimension of this: the delivery of competency based training in progress on site. We saw another innovative thing here, where TAFE teachers were delivering their vocational training and skills training not on the TAFE campus but away from the colleges in on-site classrooms. You yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, saw that. It was a particularly interesting concept. We were not just talking about theory; we saw it in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard of apprentices who potentially could be through their courses in 21 months by that method. I am not suggesting that they will be through in that time&mdash;there is something to be said for keeping young people under proper supervision for a longer period&mdash;but competency based training is something that cannot be overlooked. Again group training, because of its disciplines and its structure, has the ability to deliver those new forms of training in the best manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This suitability to handle major projects such as in the building industry is illustrated by the fact that 21 per cent of all group training apprentices were employed in the building industry, while in the allied field of electrical, a large proportion of which is household electrical, it is as high as 13 1/2 per cent. We can say, I suppose, that over a third of all apprentices in group schemes are in the building industry or allied fields. The motor vehicle trade, at 15 per cent, and food, at 12 per cent, provide the next level, and at the third level we come to things such as metals and hairdressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that the first recommendation of the committee, of which I was part, is that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments should agree to continue to fund core activities. Having been on the committee I find that there is a mood in some sections of the bureaucracy at present that we can throw some money at a problem, we can get a committee of willing volunteers together and they will run it for us, and when they have been doing it for a year or two we will slowly withdraw the government funding. Nothing could cause more damage to the group training scheme than that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who work on one of these committees know what it is like to have to select staff, to go to meetings to supervise the setting up of the organisation, to arrange for the employment of apprentices, to carry out all the financial disciplines that are required in a big scheme turning over millions of dollars every year&mdash;all this being done at difficult times by voluntary workers. The last thing they want is the threat of the core funding being removed. They are prepared to provide the time, prepared to provide the energy and prepared to make sure that the statutory requirements of the Companies Code are met&mdash;that the staff are disciplined through the proper mechanisms, that competent staff are there, that submissions to government are made in an appropriate and professional manner and that all those other duties that company directors have are carried out. They should not then have someone turn around and say, `Well, you know, we are thinking of reducing your funding.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the criticisms of the scheme, which was touched on by the honourable member for Corinella, is on the matter of financial standards. We were not saying in the report that anyone was conducting a shonky business&mdash;quite the contrary. But we were saying that there were no common financial denominators against which the schemes or some of their programs could be assessed and judged. I think group training schemes would be well served, in getting the best practice into that field of group training endeavour, by having some common denominators so that government can make an assessment of where group training can go in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add my own note of criticism to this idea of some in the bureaucracy that it is okay for the group training schemes to fund their activities from non-core profits but under no circumstances are they to use their core funding to run other schemes. There seems to me to be a lack of logic in that equation. Also it portrays the bureaucracy as saying that it is okay to fund core activities out of profits made from other government and private programs. Again, there is that lurking suggestion that core activities somehow in the future might be able to be funded privately. The core activities in all these schemes should be corralled and identified, which they will be if these new financial standards are invoked, and governments, state and federal, should concentrate on that area. What the schemes do beyond that is on their own heads and they have to account for that in the normal fiduciary ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were three areas that I found particularly interesting in the recommendations, and I was pleased to participate in them. There is the recommendation that the Department of Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with Group Training Australia, develop a network of placement coordinators. Now that is happening in some respects on an informal basis between schemes but it is critical to have a form of coordination to place people in jobs at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schemes have a very good track record. Just before I came in today, I had a look at some evidence that was given to the committee. The credit union group training company of New South Wales, New South Wales business trainees and the Bankstown retail skills centres were guaranteeing that over 90 per cent of their apprentices and trainees would get jobs. That is an amazing strike rate, and it is not a strike rate that is coming out of other government workplace programs. In South Australia, in the hospitality industry it was found that those young people coming out of the group training schemes had a better chance of employment and a higher rate of employment than other apprentices. Again, it shows that young people who go through these schemes are much sought after. One other point I make on that is that having placement coordinators is a better form of control than just having case managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one that I found pleasing was that group training should move in providing services for small business&mdash;I think that has been long awaited. Also DEET should accredit group training schemes to be able to carry out other labour market programs, and ANTA should allow group training schemes to carry out assessments. After all, they are the leaders in the field, yet sometimes they have to bring in people from organisations of lesser expertise to help them. I congratulate my fellow members of the committee, I compliment John Cummins and his staff and, indeed, compliment Tom Quinn, the President of Group Training Australia, for his cooperation with the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Group training companies recruit and employ apprentices and place those employees on a rotational basis with host employers for the duration of their indentures. Group training is uniquely an Australian scheme of providing people with skills necessary to make them productive members of the work force. The companies occupy a particular niche in entry level employment and training in small and medium sized business in Australia. Taken together, group training companies are the single largest employers of apprentices and trainees in Australia. This makes them potentially one of the most powerful forces for the implementation of change. Their strength is their diversity, and the independence given to them gives them an ability quickly to respond to the special needs of their business clients, their industries and the regions they serve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution that group training companies can make in ensuring that workers develop the skills necessary to guarantee Australia's long-term prosperity into the next century has been recognised. Group training companies have responded to the challenge of a radically changing approach to vocational education and training. This is particularly so in Tasmania, where there are no longer the same opportunities to train with big companies, to go from a trainee all the way through to the ranks of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowadays employers want skills from the time the worker starts and cannot afford to take on several levels of trainees. They could perhaps take on a first year trainee, but could not at the same time carry a third year trainee, whereas another company may require the skill level of a third year trainee and therefore be able to take on one at that level from the group training company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives the opportunity for trainees to gain their skills in a more varied environment. For instance, in the hospitality industry a first year trainee might start in a city takeaway and spend a second year in a hospital, a third year in a suburban hotel and a fourth year in an international hotel. This gives a much greater scope for experience than ever in the past. There are still some opportunities for going through with one company but these are much fewer than they were in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of links between schools and workplaces is a key component of the success of the Australian vocational training scheme. As yet, many of the school systems have not reached out to create genuine learning partnerships with employers. This report says that group training companies are ideally placed to provide the link between schools and the workplace, and they must be supported to enable them to play a key role in the implementation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania boasts one of the early group training companies, which was established through the building industry training board, partly as a result of the downturn in the building industry. Stan Joiner set up a group training scheme in 1984 and had a contract for 48 apprentices over four years. In actual fact, the company had 57 in the first 2 1/2 years. In 1987, the third full year of operation, it turned over $1 million dollars and was employing around 63 apprentices, with up to 60 employers on its books. It was successful because there were many employers who could not carry apprentices for the full four years and this scheme allowed them to retain apprentices. Their businesses had a lot more flexibility because of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now there are many schemes all over Australia. But Tasmanians have become more innovative at times, because we have fewer resources than most other states&mdash;as I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. Necessity being the mother of invention is a very apt idea for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, as things change, the group training schemes themselves have to become broader and take on the concepts of both apprentices and trainees. They need to meld them, develop modules to suit particular industries or businesses, and develop what is, after all, a chance for young people to get the proper training so they can apply for jobs that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has recognised that the maintenance of funding of core activities is essential. Although other business activities are useful, they must not be at the expense of apprenticeships and traineeships, building the core skill level for our country. It is strongly suggested that funding be recurrent, to take into account the special role that group training companies play in enhancing the skills of the Australian work force. Group training can assist small business and there is a recommendation that will encourage small businesses to take advantage of these schemes and also seek to have them promote the services that group training can provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of other positive recommendations that come from this report. The committee found that group training has helped to get a lot of people back to work, and it has proved very successful in Tasmania; but we are still only dealing with a very small percentage. The challenge now is to get more people to use the scheme, and it appears that medium and small businesses can be a growth area if it is made easier for them to have access. This may be helped by making the processes simpler and much easier to understand. There are so many different programs and names, and letters spelling out even longer names, that it is hard for everybody to keep up&mdash;especially people in small and medium sized businesses, who do not have the same access and opportunity to pick up on government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a strong selling point from group training companies in this area. They have to market themselves much better. They need to be very conscious of being out in the marketplace, gathering in these small businesses so that they can become a part of group training's overall process. There is ongoing funding to promote the concept of group training, and this may help the process become simpler in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see you, Mr Deputy Speaker Ftizgibbon, in the chair. As you said in your speech introducing this report earlier this year, group training companies have shown their potential to adapt to changing circumstances by diversifying their activities, and it is important that this be recognised and that this potential be used to its fullest. I am sure that we all agree with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on those comments. This scheme should be used to the fullest extent, continuing to train Australians to give us the skill level that we need to be in front of our competitors in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we go into Asia we need to continue to keep that skill level high, from our technical trainees through our fitters and our electricians to our building companies. We need to keep the skills right through, now that opportunities are broadening out for vocational training, and give people broader opportunities. We need to build those pathways into the future from our education system&mdash;from high school right through to people receiving degrees, in the longer term&mdash;over a longer period of time than we ever have in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking to a number of overseas people at the global cities conference in Melbourne last year left me in no doubt that Australia leads the world in the way that we are developing training and employment opportunities.
