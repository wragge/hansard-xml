<PARA>As all honourable members would be aware, generally speaking at this stage of proceedings at the end of each session the government moves a motion like this to give itself the flexibility to handle bills that come back to it in amended form or which have been initiated by the Senate. This motion will give maximum flexibility to the House to take those bills on board when they arrive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intentions of the government, should this motion be passed, is as follows. We will sit a bit later tonight, possibly till 8.00 p.m., and then suspend the sitting. We will reconvene parliament again tomorrow at 10.00 a.m. and sit until such time as we have concluded whatever it is the Senate has had the capacity to send back to us. It is very difficult to put a time on when that might occur. We might find ourselves in a situation where we adjourn very quickly. The Senate, as I understand it, intends to sit until 3.45 p.m. tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are somewhat dictated to by the fact that there is a substantial amount of time between amended legislation being properly processed after its carriage by the Senate and its arrival in this place. In recent times with some heavily amended legislation that process has taken up to six or seven hours, sometimes even longer. I do not anticipate that there will be any legislation of that character over the next couple of days, but you cannot count on it. Therefore, it is not possible to fix a time as to when affairs might conclude tomorrow. The intention of the government is that we should not sit any longer than the Senate&mdash;that is, 3.45 p.m. We hope we will be in a position to stick to that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, as I understand it, will start its valedictories around that point in time. It would be our intention, at this stage of the game, to have the valedictories more towards the middle of the day, again giving us more time towards the end of tomorrow to be able to access any legislation the Senate has sent back to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the position, Mr Speaker. I am sorry I cannot be more precise. But passage of this motion will give us the maximum possible flexibility to handle all the difficulties that might arise in the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not intend to oppose this procedural motion. It is always the case at the end of a session that the House needs to have some flexibility in its time to deal with the matters coming across from the Senate. It has always been thus; therefore, we do not oppose the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does, however, give me the opportunity to say that we are generally not happy as we look back on the last 12 months at the operations of many aspects of the parliament. Whilst not opposing this motion, we therefore take the opportunity to record our views on some general aspects of the House's operation. If you go back over the last 12 months, we have seen some unprecedented moves by this government in its operations and its management of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the government during the last 12 months has used its numbers to suspend standing order 143. Standing order 143 has been part of the standing orders of this place for literally decades and has provided the opportunity to private members to ask another private member a question about his or her intentions with regard to a private member's bill, notice of motion or otherwise. I think it is wrong for the government to close down that particular right of private members. As I say, it is unprecedented. We opposed it at the time, but it is a reflection of the attitude to the management of the House the government has acted out during this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had in the last week or so, I think, a quite extraordinary response from the government in respect of a couple of censure motions we have proposed. The Leader of the House would, I think, have to agree with me in a quiet, private moment, if it were provided, that in the past governments have accepted censure motions basically at the time they have been moved. I know that you could find precedents otherwise, but it really is quite a change in the tone of this place for the government to knock back censure motions, on one occasion in respect of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and another the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). For the Prime Minister to say, `I am not taking it,' and walk out, frankly, is holding the parliament in contempt and we again register our protest at the government's attitude to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say more generally: we always get the response from the government, `It was just as bad under you. When you were in government you were ruthless using the numbers and we have done nothing different to how it was in the Fraser administration or otherwise.' That is a consoling defence that the government puts to the parliament, but the truth is that that is not the case. When Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, he treated the parliament with a lot more respect than I am afraid it is possible to say you do. </PARA>

Yet I can show you umpteen extracts from the Current House Hansard where calling somebody a `compulsive liar' has gone through basically without any problems whatsoever.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker. My comments, however, go to the tone and the management of the House. It cannot be denied, as these examples all show, that the tone and the management of the House do not today reach the standards they once did. That is a fact. People may be sensitive about it, but that is the fact of the matter. There are umpteen examples and they are very relevant to this motion, as an aside. This motion proposes to change the procedures of the House to facilitate the last 24 hours of the House's sitting and it is perfectly reasonable and relevant that there should be some comment on the various happenings in the last 12 months which have brought us to debate this particular motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go more specifically to one aspect of this motion. This motion basically allows for the parliament to sit tomorrow but for there to be no question time. This is another change, as the Leader of the House well knows. Where we had an extra day's sitting, the precedent was for a question time to go with it. It is also true, as he can point to, that in recent years the government has abandoned that practice. But I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that they should not have abandoned that practice. When members are in the parliament, as we will be tomorrow, we are all paid to be here. The least we can have from the government&mdash;and there is plenty of time to do so, as the minister has admitted in his remarks&mdash;is for their ministers to front up for another question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for the government to basically go on holiday early when the parliament is sitting tomorrow and when there are opportunities for question time to be held. They have decided for their own political advantage that it is better not to have question time tomorrow. Our concerns about this would be significantly lessened if we did not have the roster arrangement. That is another one of the problems which have been foisted onto the parliament. The roster system allows ministers to escape the daily pressure and scrutiny that question time provides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not ask you questions, minister, because quite frankly you are irrelevant, as you well know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most of us know, when you have a minister in trouble, one of the most significant pressure points for that minister is the daily grind of question time. What happens today is that you have a go at them for a couple of days and then they basically go on holiday. For example, Minister Lawrence faces question time for two days, and then on Wednesday where is she? She is sitting in her office having a cup of tea, watching us ask you questions on matters for which she is responsible. That is a great way for a minister to escape accountability to the parliament. As I am demonstrating in these brief remarks, it is one of many aspects which this government has changed in the operation of the parliament which reduces the importance of the parliament. For that reason, it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the practices, the rules and the standing orders which have changed; it is the attitude of ministers to the parliament. For example, back in February this year the government failed to meet its responsibility to muster the numbers for a quorum, resulting in a temporary suspension of sitting. That has rarely happened, but it is no surprise that it should happen this year under the current management of the House. Earlier in that day we had Assistant Treasurer Gear forced to apologise to the House for the bungling of an income tax bill. He failed to oversee the passage of legislation for which he was responsible and, as a result, government amendments which should have been moved were overlooked. The government had to scramble the next day to resurrect its bill. In the main committee on one occasion they were unable to commence proceedings&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The glass is always half empty as far as the opposition spokesperson on parliamentary matters is concerned, and his speech reflected that. In fact, I think that over the last five or six years the parliament has come to be a much more effective chamber in the House of Representatives. It has come to be much more effective as a product of a whole series of decisions, some of which are working exceptionally well this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent innovation, which has virtually eliminated the guillotine, has been the creation of the Main Committee, which has provided a forum both for discussion of non-controversial legislation&mdash;non-controversial in the sense that it does not divide the parties, but may well be controversial for individual members of parliament and raise issues that they want to talk about&mdash;and reports, for which under no government for a very considerable period of time has there been any ability for debate at all in any parliamentary forum. The most futile motion that I move each day is to get up and move that the House take note of a variety of papers. In my lifetime in parliament, which includes a period of time in opposition, we have never got to those points, ever, and we do now as a result of those changes which have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guillotine became prolific up till a couple of years ago and generally featured in speeches made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) or his equivalent. It was, I must admit, severe in the past four or five years. It was the product of many other factors, but two of the most important of those factors also went to the good operations of this chamber. One was the fact that we moved from a three-week on, one-week off sitting pattern to a two weeks longer sitting, two weeks off sitting pattern, which all members heartily supported when those propositions were put in place for the good health and commonsense of the way in which things were debated in this House, and the elimination of evening sittings. But it removed a considerable amount of flexibility from the government in its ability to carry its legislation without recourse to the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second, and I think even more significant, factor was we actually had private member's business established on Thursday, and now on Mondays, in a way that actually gave, for most of the day, one day a week, control of the proceedings of the House to private members and what private members wanted discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recollect when I was in opposition that the nearest equivalent of that was grievance day debate on Thursday and private member's motions on Thursday. You got about an hour's worth of grievance debate on a Thursday and then you got a couple of hour's worth on the next Thursday&mdash;no grievance debate&mdash;but on the next Thursday an ability to put forward motions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grievance debate always remained, I must say. I cannot ever recollect when I was in opposition the grievance debate disappearing. And I do tend personally to regard that hour of the grievance debate as the most important block of private member's time by historical precedent. I will say that in the period of the Fraser government that hour did not disappear and we tended to get that grievance hour no matter what. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But you could forget private member's business on Thursday. You would get about two or three of them at the beginning of a session and then they would disappear completely to the virtual elimination of all private member's time except on the odd occasion when a private member's bill was allowed through for discussion&mdash;the very odd occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now private members have a chance to put their marker down on notices of motion, private member's bills, committee reports from parliamentary committee work&mdash;a whole plethora of activity that has changed the relevance of the sounding board function of this parliament and the raising of grievances function by monumental margins over any practice before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have, I think, a modern House of Representatives operation. I will not go into the fact that we now have an effectively functioning House of Representatives committee system, which we did not have when I was in opposition. We could go to that as well. That has greater longevity than the affairs that I am referring to here but, again, was an initiative that occurred under this government. So we have every reason to be proud of the way in which the House of Representatives now operates in regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of whether or not there is excessive abusive language in this House, this is a tough chamber. There is no doubt about that, and there is no question that both sides of this House play it tough. I always smile cynically when I hear opposition complaints about language that is allegedly used on this side. Perhaps opposition members on the back bench cannot hear it, but I can certainly hear the abuse that is dumped on me invariably when I stand up in this place. After 15 years of it I really could not care less, but I do care about it when people get up and start chatting away as though the affairs in this regard were a one-sided event in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was even a particular incident cited about the use of the word `liar'. As I recollect, on that occasion that you chose to refer to, the first use of that epithet came from the other side of the House. I would agree that it would be better if we did not exchange our views in that fashion, there is no doubt about that, but I also do not think that we ought to diminish ourselves by suggesting that that is a reflection of the quality of what is put in this place. The quality of what is put in this place is very high. The level of verbal violence in this place is also quite high but, in comparison with that which is prevalent in a few other parliamentary forums, I would say we are quite mild. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there is quality debate here. There is much that ought to be removed, but there is also quality debate&mdash;more of the fact that the glass is half full rather than half empty. Let me say this, too: I have attended the House of Commons on a number of occasions. We might think we are a bit rough in our handling of each other in this place, but I would invite your occasional attendance on the tough days in the House of Commons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are as nothing compared with what the British are capable of when put to it. It is no accident that this occurs, of course, in the United Kingdom because they fail to provide seats for 200 members of parliament so, when the chamber is actually full, just a normal proceeding represents a riot. When you have 450 seated and another 200 trying to get seats in the chamber, it does lead to the odd bit of dysfunction every now and again. It is also no accident that in the House of Commons the distance between the front benches is two sword points distance as a formal process of separating both sides of the House. So I do not think, violent though our language gets here from time to time, we are by any means a chamber that is as capable of disreputable behaviour as others. It is not unusual that that is the case because there are big issues at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the operations of the parliament, the operations of the parliament now are as good as any I can remember. In terms of the&mdash;</PARA>

In terms of the access to parliamentary forums via the Main Committee, via a private member's day, I think we could say in all honesty that we as ordinary members of parliament in this chamber have never had it so good. The capacity to get up on anything since I was a back bench member of parliament in opposition has dramatically changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to question time, the opposition manager had things to say about the absence of question time tomorrow. Let me say this: I once took out figures on the days on which parliament sat in which no question time was held&mdash;although I have not done so lately, I will concede that. I was delighted to note that the average performance in the period of the Fraser government was about twice ours in terms of sittings of parliament without question time. It was by no means an unprecedented set of events before we came into office. On the final day, of course, it does allow us the flexibility, and that is a flexibility that not just we but other governments have claimed as the years have gone by.</PARA>

If they have been asked questions, you could count them on the fingers of one hand. They have only themselves to blame if they have not taken the opportunity to question deeply Ms McHugh on the excellent conduct of her ministry or Mr Walker on the excellent conduct of his.

<PARA>The new Commonwealth Law Courts building in Melbourne will provide some 36,000 square metres of gross floor area and provide accommodation for the High Court of Australia, the Federal Court of Australia, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. Currently these jurisdictions occupy space in four separate locations. The ad hoc nature of these facilities makes it extremely difficult for the courts to operate efficiently. The Public Works Committee tabled a report on 22 November 1995 recommending the project at a maximum construction cost of $108.4 million in the 1994-95 budget context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their report the committee also raised some issues to which the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has provided the following responses. The Attorney-General's Department advises that consultation with the Victorian government has occurred during the development of the project and will continue to occur during its further development, particularly in relation to the issues identified by the Public Works Committee. The Attorney-General's Department advises that a formal consultative committee has been established with the Community and Public Sector Union to provide an essential ongoing consultative forum. This committee meets monthly and will continue to do so for the duration of the project. Other representatives on the committee include the project team, the various jurisdictions and CPSU workplace delegates. If approved, the construction is anticipated to commence in August 1996 and be completed in April 1999. I would like to thank the committee for their report.

<PARA>The Department of Defence proposes to relocate the artillery centre from North Head in Sydney to Puckapunyal to meet training requirements and to make best use of existing facilities at Puckapunyal. This proposal will provide the Artillery Centre with ready access to a suitable field firing range and it will ensure utilisation of existing facilities in Puckapunyal after the departure of the First Armoured Regiment for Darwin.

<PARA>This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 27 October 1995. The committee has now duly reported back to parliament. The main elements of the proposed work are the construction of a three-storey development of 10 apartments and recreation facilities at 9/11 Jalan Taman U Thant, and construction of a three-storey development of six townhouses and two apartments at No. 4 of the same address. The total estimated outturn cost of the project is $11.54 million at May 1995 prices. It is proposed to call selected tenders from Australian construction companies which have a joint venture arrangement with Malaysian construction companies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report I have just tabled follows an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs into Audit Report No. 24 of 1994-95, which was a follow-up audit of the Northern Land Council. Following a request from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in June 1993, an audit was conducted of the Northern Land Council, with the Auditor-General's report being tabled in the House on 14 December 1993. The committee conducted an inquiry following that audit report and tabled its report in May 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the first audit report being completed, the minister requested a follow-up audit after 12 months. The follow-up audit report was tabled in the House on 27 March and referred to the committee on 30 March 1995. Following invitations to the relevant agencies to make submissions, the committee held public hearings in Canberra on 28 August 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key findings of the follow-up audit noted that, while the Northern Land Council had made significant progress in implementing the 52 recommendations of the first audit report, there remained some outstanding concerns on the implementation of several recommendations. The follow-up audit report acknowledged the concerted effort made by the Northern Land Council in addressing the 52 recommendations of the first audit report. Most of the recommendations have been satisfactorily complied with and substantial progress has been made with most of the remaining recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Land Council have pointed out that some recommendations could not be complied with until other prerequisite actions, such as strategic planning, had been completed. Nonetheless, while acknowledging the very considerable progress made and the ongoing nature of some recommendations, the Australian National Audit Office noted that, in a small number of areas, further action was needed. The follow-up audit report made five recommendations, four of which were addressed to the Northern Land Council and one to the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its recommendation 1, the audit office recommended that the NLC review the royalty payment procedures to ensure their completeness. The audit office sought the implementation of an appropriate royalty trust fund accounting system to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the accounting function. The Northern Land Council advised that the new financial management accounting package was now in place and that the trust accounts were in the process of being changed over to the new system. The audit office stated that it was satisfied with the actions taken to meet this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 2 is that the Northern Land Council ensure that all branch managers are conversant with the budget monitoring system. This followed findings by the audit office that some branch managers were not aware of and therefore not using the system to monitor their budgets. The Northern Land Council advised that there had been an increase in the training of managers. Staff are being trained on the newly installed financial management system. In addition, following the completion of a strategic plan, a corporate planning exercise will be completed this year. The audit office indicated that these developments were in the right direction but warned that new staff coming into the organisation after the initial training exercise will need appropriate induction training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 3 dealt with aspects of the Northern Land Council debt recovery process. The Northern Land Council response indicated the emphasis it has given to debt avoidance. However, the ANAO noted that a significant proportion of the existing debts had been outstanding for more than 90 days and that improvements to the recovery procedures were needed. The Northern Land Council indicated that it is now trying to identify those debts that are recoverable and those that need to be written off. The audit office believed that the Northern Land Council evidence indicated that procedures had been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 4 was for the Northern Land Council to immediately take action to monitor the use of fuel cards and motor vehicles and include these arrangements in the procedures manual. The Northern Land Council stated that a fleet management system had been introduced to facilitate appropriate monitoring. The audit office believed this was an appropriate measure and similar to that used by the Department of Administrative Services for its fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 5 was addressed to the Australian Taxation Office. It recommended urgent action be initiated to make the reduction in the mining withholding tax effective. The reduction was implemented before the audit reports were completed. However, the audit office was concerned that the Department of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office need to establish appropriate mechanisms so that legislative changes can be implemented promptly and guidelines disseminated to the appropriate officers for immediate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that actions taken by the Northern Land Council in response to both audit reports have implemented the changes sought. The committee agrees with the audit office that there has been a positive response from both the Northern Land Council and ATSIC, with their `well done' comment on the outcomes. There has been a substantial change in the management culture of the Northern Land Council and the committee commends their commitment and effectiveness in becoming a more efficient organisation. The committee believes it important that the annual audit process for the Northern Land Council monitor the recent changes to ensure that they continue to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I take this opportunity, as this will probably be the last chance I will have before the election to speak as chair of this committee, to thank all the members of the committee for their outstanding hard work over the last three years. I am particularly grateful and thankful for the support given by my deputy chair, the member for Cowper, Garry Nehl, who has been a very solid supporter and assistant throughout that process. I appreciate the cooperation I have received as chair from all members of the committee and from the secretariat&mdash;Mr Allan Kelly and the other staff of the committee. It has been a great honour and privilege to chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;At the outset I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his kind words in relation to me, but whether or not I deserve such praise is beside the point. The point he makes is that the committee has worked extremely well. It has had membership from all the major parties. It has worked with great harmony and to the benefit of the parliament, the people of Australia and, certainly, indigenous Australians. I share the chair's commendations of the secretary of the committee, Mr Allan Kelly, and his staff who were all hard working and assiduous in carrying out the affairs of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report just tabled by my colleague the member for Moreton emphasises the high level of accountability required in the Aboriginal affairs sector. It is much higher than in many other sectors in public and private administration. The Northern Land Council has acted to address a range of deficiencies identified in the 1993 audit report and those in the most recent report. Like the member for Moreton, I am very pleased that the Northern Land Council has addressed these and is going forward as a more effective and efficient organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A large amount of funding goes to indigenous organisations. There is a widespread perception throughout the broad Australian community that there is considerable, if not enormous, waste in Aboriginal affairs. That perception is shared by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the course of its inquiries in the last three years the committee has had many submissions and comments from indigenous Australians along that line. What this comes down to is that, whatever the reason, indigenous organisations have to be like Caesar's wife&mdash;certainly much more transparent and more accountable than many other organisations in mainstream society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties has been&mdash;and it is still there&mdash;that we provide money for indigenous organisations and there is what I frequently call the in-built failure factor, which is not in the best interests of Aboriginal people, of Torres Strait Islander people or of Australia as a whole. We say to one particular organisation, `Here is $3 million, boys. Go off and do it.' In many cases these grants are given to people who in terms of modern business are unsophisticated, to say the least, and without the managerial experience or the administrative backup to go ahead and do it. They get into trouble and then everybody comes down on them like a ton of bricks. They have, in many cases, no option but to get into trouble because we are giving large amounts of money to them without providing the infrastructure, the training, the experience and the skills for them to properly manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a point I have made time and again in the course of the deliberations of the committee and I do so again. When we provide funding for indigenous organisations, unless we also provide some additional funding for training in management and accountability and accounting and provide the backup and the people to look after it and make sure that it runs properly, it is doomed to failure. That is in nobody's interest. We have to make sure not only that is money not wasted but that the perception that money is being wasted can be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The track record is such that it can be demonstrated clearly that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are running their own affairs successfully and that the level of waste has diminished considerably. To do that, we have to provide the backup and some additional funding to make sure that the training is there so that they can get on and do the job properly without heading for disaster automatically. More and more this is no longer the case, but it does exist. We as a parliament need to address this issue, to seize it, to deal with it. No matter who is in government after the next election, it is important that this factor gets some emphasis because without it we will still have that widespread perception of and fact of waste, inefficiency and disaster. We all want a situation where indigenous Australians are managing their own affairs and doing it extremely well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak on the motion before the House. As the federal member for Perth in this parliament, I have taken great pride and felt very humble at having had the opportunity to help mark a very significant year of our nation's history. This year, we have commemorated, paid tribute to and celebrated the efforts of those who helped to bring about victory in the Pacific and end World War II. It has been an important national year. The truism that applies to a family, local community or nation is that, unless you understand and appreciate your past, you cannot plan for your future. Perhaps the greatest feature of the Australia Remembers year and program has been that, for the first time, we have made a truly national and community effort to ensure that our young people have an understanding of Australia's contribution and the contribution that a generation of Australians made for Australia in World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of making that effort as a community and personally and ensuring that our young people understand this contribution came home to me on Anzac Day this year. Like many local residents, I attended a dawn service in Halliday Park in Bayswater on Anzac Day. After the ubiquitous sausage sizzle, I got home about 7 a.m. When I opened the door, my son, who was then three going on eight and who is now nearly four going on 14 and who will be traipsing the corridors of the House later this afternoon, said, `Daddy where have you been?' I said, `I've been working.' He said, `No you haven't, Daddy. You've been standing up for those who died.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course he was right. He had woken up, and I wasn't there. Jane had flicked on the televised dawn service and explained what I was doing. After he made this point to me, I asked myself: why do we stand up? We stand up for what a generation of Australians stood up for, for freedom, democracy, liberty and our way of life. When these things were threatened, a generation of Australians rallied to defend them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also stand up for the sacrifice that they made. We stand up for what that generation of Australians helped to forge as national Australian traits and characteristics. They are traits they forged more often than not through pain, fear, suffering and hardship. Those national traits forged in the course of those years were courage, a sense of humour in adversity, mateship, loyalty, sticking together, ingenuity and tenacity, a healthy disrespect for authority unless that authority was deserving of respect or earned that respect and, perhaps most importantly of all, tolerance and a fair go for others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate debt that Australians of my generation and my son's generation owe to the generation of Australians in 1945 is that those national traits and characteristics are able to be applied by them in peacetime rather than in war. It is for that debt that this very significant and, in my view, very great program has been supported by the government, the parliament and the community this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Locally in Perth, like other federal members and federal electorate divisions, we established a local Australia Remembers federal Perth committee, which consisted of representatives from local RSL sub-branches, from local city, shire and town councils, and from local schools and historical societies.

The major objectives that the local committee sought to work by were to encourage all Australians to remember and thank the veterans who fought in World War II campaigns; to recognise and appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of the widows and children of those veterans who did not return home or who died in intervening years; to encourage all Australians to remember and thank all those who remained at home and kept the home front running; to create a sense of relief and excitement which marked the end of the war in 1945; and to educate the nation about the horrors and impact of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local federal Perth committee sought to initiate activities and make contact with community organisations to encourage them to conduct Australia Remembers activities. I take this opportunity to thank all those organisations that took part either directly or in a representative capacity in the local federal Perth Australia Remembers Committee. I have mentioned Kevin Lang. There were local state members of parliament, including my state parliamentary colleague, the member for Perth, Diana Warnock. There were representatives of various RSL sub-branches, including the Mount Lawley-Inglewood sub-branch, the Eastern Regional sub-branch, the Bedford Morley sub-branch, the Bellevue sub-branch and the Maylands sub-branch.

Local schools were represented by Marilyn Piper from John Forrest Senior High School. The various historical societies or associations in my electorate&mdash;which include the Bayswater, the Bassendean, the Maylands, the Swan-Guildford and the North Perth historical societies&mdash;were represented by Betty Mazzarol from the Bayswater Historical Society and Michael Grogan from the Bassendean Historical Society. I was very pleased that all those organisations and community representatives were able to take part in this significant year's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local federal Perth Australia Remembers Committee sponsored a range of activities. I would like to briefly draw those to the attention of the House. The committee, in part, sponsored a city of Stirling VE Day dance at the Maylands library. The dance sought to reflect Australia's lifestyle in 1945 and the mood of Australians in the final year of the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also sponsored the Mount Lawley Senior High School to coordinate an extended school and community awareness program with the 1st and 2nd/11th Battalions of the City of Perth Regiment. I was very pleased to take part in the culmination of those programs with the Mount Lawley Senior High School students and the representatives of the 1st and 2nd/11th Battalions in the Mount Lawley Senior High School library and to formally mark the occasion by drawing to the community's attention the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Centenary Memorial Library Book</EMPHASIS>, held by the Mount Lawley Senior High School library, which records donations of books made in the course of the school's history on behalf of members of the 1st and 2nd/11th Battalions. </PARA>

I was pleased to present to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) this week a copy of the book published by the society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The society also organised a display in conjunction with John Forrest Senior High School students, which featured written and oral histories of local people who lived during those war years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very pleased that the committee sponsored the RSL Bedford-Morley sub-branch commemorative dinner on 15 August, which coincided with the sub-branch's 50th anniversary. That occasion was attended by many members of the Bedford-Morley RSL sub-branch, very many of whom bowl at the Bedford bowling club, where my father has bowled since 1967. In the course of conversation that evening, members of the sub-branch who have had conversations with my father since 1967, suggested that I had learned a fair bit about politics from him. My riposte to the members on that occasion was that they needed to understand that bowling was a bit like politics&mdash;that is, one needed to understand where the bias was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local Australia Remembers federal Perth Committee also sponsored the Australian Railways Historical Society in its development of a permanent display recognising the vital role that the Midland Westrail Railway Workshops played in the course of World War II. The Midland Westrail Railway Workshops were utilised in the course of World War II to ensure that contracts were completed for propellers and engines for minesweepers, Yarrow type boilers for Corvettes, forgings for Australian standard Garret locomotives, and a range of 25-pounder shell forgings. So the work force at the workshops during the later years of the war, which then included a significant proportion of women, played a significant role in the preparation of munitions and equipment. </PARA>

The sub-branch's activities included children's school and artwork which commemorated the end of World War II. Members of that sub-branch visited local schools and provided relevant students with a presentation about the significance of the week. As well, a commemoration plaque was placed on the Bellevue RSL Memorial. I was very pleased, together with Arthur Elder and Bill Gaynor from the Bellevue RSL sub-branch, to take part in that ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those activities, a centrepiece of the local Perth Australia Remembers Committee support for Australia Remembers activities in the course of the year was the sponsorship of local schools in the electorate which conducted Australia Remembers activities. This was in the form of either a competition or other appropriate Australia Remembers commemoration activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have over 50 primary and high schools in my electorate. Time prevents me from going through all of the activities of all of the schools, but I draw attention to a few. I have referred to the Mount Lawley Senior High School's activities with the 11th and 2nd/11th City of Perth battalions. I was pleased recently at Anzac Terrace Primary School in Bassendean to commemorate the moving of the flagpole of the school, formally dedicated on 11 November, and very pleased recently that at Bassendean Primary School the Minister for Veterans' Affairs made a presentation to the school library for its activities in the course of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of other functions which were held in the course of the year which were not formally sponsored by the Perth Australia Remembers Committee but which were nonetheless supported by the committee and the community. I was very pleased to be able to attend the Mount Lawley-Inglewood RSL sub-branch Australia Remembers dinner on 15 August at the Cascades Tavern in Maylands. I was very pleased recently at a regular monthly meeting of the sub-branch to be able to present Australia Remembers certificates of appreciation to that branch. I am looking forward to attending the sub-branch's annual dinner later this year. The City of Bayswater conducted a Victory in the Pacific march and luncheon on VP Day. It was a tremendous occasion. I am looking forward to the city's launch of the video of the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I was very pleased that local authorities in my electorate also took the opportunity of engaging in Operation Restoration to restore a number of local war memorials.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly appreciated the fact that he took the trouble to come to a meeting of the Moore electorate committee, and that meeting in fact was the one in which the seeding funds were allocated to the various applicants. I found having him there with the advice he gave was very useful. All the way through the Australia Remembers commemoration year, Keith Mattingley has been an extremely good leader. I would like to congratulate him and Mrs Mattingley, because I know they made quite extraordinary efforts to ensure that they were present at as many of the functions as possible, and that really did give the Western Australian effort in the Australia Remembers program an extra fillip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the electorate of Moore, we had a very active participation in Australia Remembers. At an early stage, we instituted the committee, and it was formed of representatives from many of the community groups, schools, clubs and institutions, including of course the RSL, the local city councils and others. Those representatives all participated to ensure that in Moore there was a first-class program of events to commemorate what was effectively the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I look at those people individually, I would like to make a couple of comments about the benefits of the Australia Remembers commemoration. I must commend again the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for what has been an historical contribution to Australia's commemoration of its past events. The themes that were set up by the original Australia Remembers project were designed to recognise not only the sacrifices and efforts made by those who had served in military theatres and auxiliary services to the military forces but also the efforts of those at home&mdash;those people who stayed and made sacrifices in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, where around 25 to 27 per cent of the people were actually born in the United Kingdom or Ireland, we had the added feature of having a large number of people who had been in Britain during the war and had suffered considerably thanks to the Blitz and the blockade by the U-boats which prevented vital supplies from reaching the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee set about ensuring that there was going to be an across-the-board celebration in what has been, as we now know, a very successful project. Enlarging on the themes I spoke of earlier, I would like to point out that, during the Second World War in Wanneroo in particular&mdash;actually from North Beach all the way up to the city of Wanneroo and beyond to Two Rocks&mdash;there was a great consciousness of the proximity of the war. This was due not the least to the fact that many of the people living there were in the market garden and growing industries and contributed to the war effort by growing valuable foodstuffs. Another factor was Wanneroo's proximity to the coast, because various points along the coast acted as valuable lookouts or important strategic points for any potential Japanese invasion of the coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention some of the people who were involved in my committee. I will start off with Maureen Hill. Maureen is an officer of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, a friend and a member of the committee. She provided a terrific liaison between the department and the committee. I must commend the officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Perth, because they were very helpful and provided first-class support for all of our efforts. Maureen has been a very active local community member in the electorate and was able to give us some valuable insights into how the Australia Remembers program was going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Margaret Cockman, who is from the city of Wanneroo and works in the culture and recreation department, was absolutely fantastic with her contribution and helped us to reach our objectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had assistance from Philip Baker from the Church of Jesus Christ; Colin Fletcher from 53 Regional Cadet Union; Tony Martin, a former Wanneroo citizen of the year and former Chief Inspector of Police and also during the war a diver, who used to dive in Fremantle Harbour to ensure no limpid mines were attached to the military or merchant shipping in the harbour; Phil Renkin, President of the Yanchep-Two Rocks RSL; John Astill from the Northshore Rotary Club; Daryl Deacon from Craigie High School; Don Edwards from the North Suburban Historical Society and Coastal Heritage Association of Western Australia; Kelcey Toleman from 507 Regional Cadet Union at Joondalup; Cara Cox from the North Beach Primary School; Kate Hurlbatt from the training ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marmion</EMPHASIS> naval cadets; Captain Alex Kent from 507 Regional Cadets; Justin Townsend from No. 2 Flight Wanneroo Air Training Cadets; Michelle Westaway from 53 Regional Cadet Unit; Ian Grealish of the same unit; and Arthur Ventham from the Wanneroo Schools Association. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to now briefly talk about some of the events that occurred. Amongst those events, we had a very useful and informative exhibition put on by the North Suburban Historical Society. They have also undertaken the production of a video presenting the Australian War Memorial and museum and the collection of a representative photographic display from the Western Australian newspapers from the period. Incidentally, the museum is located in an old water tank that has been converted into a museum at the Mount Flora reserve. That water tank used to be a very valuable strategic lookout during the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge a number of other important projects, not the least of which was undertaken on 28 May where 30 volunteers from the Men of the Trees in the area and the Friends of Yellagonga, led by Mike Norman of Sorrento, planted 550 commemorative trees in the northern area of the Yellagonga Regional Park. They will be installing a plinth and park in the area later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, Glengarry Primary School had a special service on Anzac Day where the students dedicated a flagpole memorial to those who lost their lives during World War II. Many of the students wore black armbands or special Australia Remembers armbands during sporting events in the area held during that weekend immediately adjacent to VP Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to specifically remember the Remember and Rejoice display at Gloucester Lodge Museum which was held on 1 October by the city of Wanneroo and the people responsible for the preservation of Gloucester Lodge. This was to recognise the RAAF Radar Unit 227, No. 4 Medical Rehabilitation Unit and the 10th Light Horse. It provided an exhibition of the history of Wanneroo and an Australia Remembers commemoration march past by cadets and veterans, as well as other exhibitions. For instance, Jack Sue from Z Force was there. It was an absolutely superb afternoon&mdash;one of the great memories of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point out that the Wanneroo City Library also contributed by putting together an oral history capturing the individual experiences in the words of the veterans and in a way not possible with published works. The Australia Remembers collection comprises over 30 interviews that have been published in cassette form conducted by community volunteers, with the interviews vividly recording varied war experiences from residents who enlisted, prisoners of war, work camp internees and market gardeners who produced valuable war food supplies. That was launched on Tuesday, 15 August, VP Day, at the Woodvale library, comprising a tape of composite interviews and a synopsis of all the tapes supported by a display of memorabilia. Those tapes are available for reference from the Whitfords library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great events was the Sentimental Journey Concert which was held at the Wanneroo Civic Centre. That was an absolutely wonderful production put on by the city entertainers. It was basically a kaleidoscope, a smorgasbord of events, with the focus being on the Second World War, old-time music hall themes, moving all the way through to the present. It actually used the theme from 1945 to 1995. The response from the audience at every concert was one of acclaim. The performers did a fantastic job; the singing and the production were superb. Particularly for people who had a background of music hall experience, whether in the United Kingdom or here in Australia, it gave a lot to feel nostalgic and to reminisce about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schools in the area got right behind Australia Remembers. I have mentioned the North Beach school which had a wonderful display. They put a plaque in their main assembly area. I would like to recongratulate Cara Cox, the then acting deputy principal, who was responsible for the Australia Remembers activities at that school. The other week she was also responsible for the presentation of Australia Remembers commemorative certificates of appreciation&mdash;a great idea&mdash;to veterans who were associated with or living near the school. That school really got behind the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Craigie Senior High School conducted a very enthusiastic and significant memories project.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to congratulate the Wann-Gara Inner Wheel and the Wanneroo Rotary which put on a gala supper dance at the Wanneroo Civic Centre on 2 September. That was another great success. I would like to recognise Margaret Bain and Buzz Goodacre from Inner Wheel and Wanneroo Rotary respectively. I would also like to recognise the Ocean Reef Residents Association which built a commemorative seat which has been placed on the Trig Point lookout at Ocean Reef to commemorate Australia Remembers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We formed a committee with RSL and community representatives. The level of participation that took place within my community was such that it is not really possible to single out individuals, some of whom may have played a more significant part than others. There were very few people who were asked to contribute and to assist who did not give of their very best. RSL organisations were amongst the base structures, as were teachers and principals from various schools and citizens just in their capacity as citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of Melbourne Ports, with such important edifices as the shrine and the barracks, enabled us to put together historic tours for school children.

I am sorry that the minister, who is a lover of horses&mdash;I do not know whether he is a successful punter&mdash;was unable to make it on that occasion.

I have never seen that level of enthusiasm and community spirit at any of the many marches that I have attended and participated in. It was a tribute which was richly deserved and it was a tribute which was generously given. For many, it was an occasion which will not be forgotten, particularly by the young children. Many of them marched with their grandfathers and fathers, but mainly their grandfathers, wearing the medals that had been won. It was a march out of the ordinary. It was a march which brought the people of Melbourne together in a way which happens, unfortunately, only too infrequently. </PARA>

Those of us who are in this parliament are involved, by the very nature of the Westminster system, in a situation of continual debate and disagreement. Those people who attend this parliament and observe our behaviour are entitled to think that basically we are fierce protagonists and that there is seldom any point of agreement. Ceremonies and events like this do tend to remind us that we are one people. When our nation in the past has been threatened there has been a spirit of unanimity which flows through the Australian people where differences are forgotten. It is therefore important that we see the Australia Remembers ceremony as not merely a tribute to those who made sacrifices but an occasion which brought together our people with one sense of purpose, one concept, and an ideal about who we are. We might not always agree on where we are going, but the important thing is that people across the board were reaching out to each other in order to say thank you to a generation of Australians who served their communities, their small towns and this country well. </PARA>

The committee comprised Mr Bill Gaynor, Mrs Barbara Harper-Nelson from the Shire of Kalamunda, Mr Mac Wroth from the Shire of Toodyay, Mrs Jan Smith, who was the mayor and representative of the town of Northam, Mrs Judi Tomlinson from the Shire of Chittering and Mrs Jan Zeck from the Shire of Swan. All local authorities were invited to participate and did so with a great deal of enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of the Pearce celebrations was a week of activities at our regional shopping centre, Midland Gate, from 14 to 19 August 1995. The week was organised to acknowledge those in Pearce, and their relatives, who served in the Australian defence forces during World War II and those who played their part both at home and abroad. The sacrifice and commitment they made can never be fully appreciated by those of us who were not there; by some of us who were born just as the war was ending; and by some of us who were not in this realm at the time of the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult for us to fully appreciate what these people sacrificed and what they went through. It is through occasions such as Australia Remembers week that we are able to share experiences with those people and gain a greater understanding. We are also able to remember and pay tribute to those who contributed to making our nation what it is today. I was really delighted by the wonderful response in our community to this event. I would like to thank all of those who involved themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many schools and community groups participated in an assortment of events and displays, bringing their understanding of history, their artistic abilities, their writing abilities, their musical abilities, dancing, acting and so on all to the fore. It provided a wonderful week, which I know many of our veterans enjoyed immensely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Groups including the Shire of Swan, the Pearce RAAF base, the navy, Defence Force Recruiting, Hollywood Hospital, the Australian Red Cross, the Australian Railway Society and the Western Australian Museum all participated in the Pearce week of Australia Remembers. Group Captain Dennis Green, Officer Commanding of RAAF base Pearce, officially opened the week of activities and gave a very moving address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schools that participated included Greenmount, Riverlands, Falls Road, Bellevue, Woodlupine, High Wycombe and Middle Swan primary schools, John Forrest High School, and Mazenod College&mdash;I would particularly like to thank them for their college swing band's contribution of music of the era. Fourteen schools took part in a week of activity and displays, as I said, which covered a whole spectrum of talent. The schools that won awards were Kalamunda Primary School, Bindoon Primary School and Falls Road Primary School. The standard of work was extremely high and the judges had a very difficult decision to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the students from Kalamunda Primary School, Lisa Tan, summed up the whole essence of the week's activity in a poem that reflected the message of peace. It seems to me that many of the young people, as they listened to the stories of the veterans, understood very much that these were people who made sacrifices to bring about a peaceful Australia and that peace is an important ongoing theme for us all. It was very moving to see how deeply many of the young people understood that message. It was certainly a common thread in many of the displays that were exhibited in that week. Lisa Tan from year 7 at Kalamunda Primary School said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Derek Cowling was one such veteran, and I thought I might read a little of his background. He was a volunteer in the air force in 1940. He was a wireless operator and a gunner. He became a gunnery officer with the 44th Squadron, Lincoln, which was the first Lancaster squadron ever formed to fly an operation over Germany. The first Lancaster was delivered in 1941. He was involved in 16 sorties over Germany but was shot down on 6 October 1942 and captured three days later on the Dutch border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He spent time in two separate camps&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Dulag Luft and the Stalag Luft 3, which was the main air force prisoner of war camp in Germany. Whilst in the Stalag Luft, Mr Cowling was a member of the escape organisation. They started three tunnels called Tom, Dick and Harry. Eventually, 76 officers escaped one night out of Harry. The tunnel was 310 feet long. Fifty of the officers were subsequently murdered on direct orders of Hitler. This murder was stopped by Goering, who appealed directly to Hitler. As a result of the escape, only three officers got back to the United Kingdom, two Belgians and one Norwegian&mdash;all of whom could speak fluent German. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was just wonderful to watch the expressions on the young people's faces as these stories were related. They asked: How did they manage to cart all that sand out of the tunnels? How could they see in the darkness of the tunnel? Mr Cowling explained how they rigged up a system of electricity to provide them light in the tunnels. They were just totally caught up in these stories and in these events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There were others. There was Mr Tom Pilmoor, who brought along his mess kit. He showed the boys the basic kit that they had and explained what they did. Of course, some of the children were asking: did you have a gun? Did you use it? Again, the great interest that was taken in the experience of these veterans was something to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keith Flannagan of Darlington put together an audiovisual presentation `The Quiet Lion' as a tribute to the life and times of Sir Weary Dunlop. I remember a lunch celebration which brought together all the veterans and other people from that era who live in the Chittering area of my electorate. One of the veterans was relating an experience and talking about a young soldier who was a veteran of war at 19. Being taunted by the Japanese across the way who were saying, `We are coming to get you Australians,' he had finally had enough and poked his head up and yelled, `If you are coming over mate, bring some bottles. We are a bit dry over here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wonderful sense of humour in the most appalling conditions came through, along with the dreadful sacrifices that had to be made. The awe the children held these people in was just immense and I am sure that the experiences shared will be valuable for them as they go through their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was very appreciative of the enormous support given to the Australia Remembers week by Mr Lew Hoek and all his staff at the Midland Gate Shopping Centre. The Pearce Australia Remembers committee allocated a portion of its funding for the week's celebration and the balance was apportioned to each of the shires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shire of Mundaring rededicated the Blackboy Hill memorial; the shire of Kalamunda upgraded its war memorial; the shire of Toodyay provided lights for the memorial and held a school essay competition; the town of Northam had a `Return to Northam' lunch, because one of the training camps was at Northam; the shire of Chittering had an honour board made and a reunion lunch; and the shire of Swan put together a wonderful photographic exhibition which highlighted the role that women played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that I am not able to read some of the stories about the women, but time does not permit. Sometimes women's roles both abroad and at home have become a little dim in the remembrances. It was wonderful to see these women remembered and saluted for their contribution. I could not help but note when I went to Toodyay for the rededication of the war memorial that many women were listed on that memorial. Many women gave their lives, many while serving as nurses or caring for the sick and injured. Their stories are very moving. I was pleased that we were able to salute the women. Perhaps I have time to read one of those stories. It came out of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">White Coolies</EMPHASIS> and reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a story of women who fought in the last war. Yes! I mean fought, for they surely did, just as surely as the sailor with his submarines and guns, the soldier with rifle and tank, and the airman with bombs and machine-guns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With these women, it was a different kind of war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They fought against anything which threatened to destroy life. Theirs was a courage not stimulated by lust for battle, but born of women's natural instinct to tend the sick, the helpless, the suffering and the fearful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What they suffered physically was almost inhuman, but only woman can fully appreciate their terrible mental anguish and constant dreadful fear of what the Nipponese could and might do to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a story which should be read and remembered, not only for the fine examples of courage and bravery of which it tells, but also for the grand humour, resourcefulness, and ability to overcome the greatest of problems, and withal, to keep morale at the highest imaginable level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is so typical of the Army Nurses. I had the privilege of seeing them in many places. I saw them in the desert, in the jungle, and on the high seas. I saw them housed in tents or huts menaced by all the terrors of war as well as by the scourge of malaria, scrub typhus, and other tropical diseases. The longer the war progressed, the greater grew my admiration for them. I will never cease to love them all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his staff for their efforts during this year. In this past year, the year of Australia Remembers, every Australian has been touched in some way by the Australia Remembers program. Many thousands of activities associated with the program have occurred throughout the nation, and what a diverse and interesting range of activities there has been. These activities around the nation were and still are being enthusiastically embraced by millions of Australians, especially by the younger members of our community keen on remembering or learning about the contribution of uniformed and civilian men and women to Australia's war effort. These young people, as members of a generation who have never had to face the horrors of war, now more than ever understand and appreciate the enormous sacrifices that uniformed and civilian men and women made for this country, for future generations and for peace. This, I believe, is the lasting legacy of this year and demonstrates the success of the Australia Remembers program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Throsby I convened and established the Throsby Australia Remembers committee, which comprised a diverse range of community groups and local RSL sub-branches. We tried to involve the whole of the community. We arranged a whole range of activities for the very young to the more senior members of the community. All the local RSLs participated except one. I pay tribute to the RSL membership of Port Kembla, Warilla and Albion Park. Each played a magnificent role. I also pay tribute to and commend all members of the Throsby Australia Remembers committee for their ideas, their participation and their continued enthusiasm for organising and arranging the large number of activities which were part of the Australia Remembers program this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been listening to some of the speeches in this debate. It is rather like each of our maiden speeches, our first speeches, where we thank everyone and list various things. I am going to follow that tradition and outline some of the activities of, and thank the many people who were involved in, the Australia Remembers campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our year was launched by the minister on an official visit on 3 February 1995. He launched the Australia Remembers campaign at the Breakwater Battery Museum at Port Kembla. Throughout the year the Breakwater Battery Museum was very much a focus point for us because we had various activities there. The museum was an old coastal watchtower, very close to the steelworks at Port Kembla. The steelworks were a target and a very important aspect of the building that now is the Breakwater museum. The museum had a display which went throughout the year and which was regularly changed. There were local activities associated with our area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the local activities involved the Owen gun, which was invented by Evelyn Owen and built at Port Kembla. I heard the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) talking about the contribution of women to the war effort. The women at Port Kembla made a magnificent contribution. They worked in the factory building the Owen gun. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, who is at the table, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), would appreciate, the Owen gun saved millions of lives. It replaced the old .303. It could be dropped in the mud or anywhere and could still be fired. It was invented and built in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Illawarra Folk Club put on a concert in March. It was so enthusiastically received that a tape was made of it. We also had displays throughout the year at the local Tongarra Museum, which is almost a community museum at Albion Park. It was very much the heart of Albion Park during the war years. All sorts of displays were put on there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Port Kembla RSL had a magnificent ball in April. In June, we had the golden wedding anniversary of Francis and Juanita O'Brien. They met in Townsville and were married in Cairns, or it might have been the other way around. They were at the ball, as they now reside at Dapto, so we made their anniversary a feature of the ball. I know that there were many golden wedding anniversaries during the year, but we featured that couple, who symbolised so many other anniversaries throughout the year. The Roo Theatre, as always, assisted us. They put on a production which toured around the various clubs. They had a cabaret featuring songs and dances from the 1940s. As always, the enthusiastic youth group wrote their own work and displayed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was quite a big day on 9 July. We had a magnificent march through the streets of Port Kembla. It was the biggest one in the Illawarra. We had everything there, from old wartime vehicles to detachments from all over the Illawarra, including some of the Land Army women in their blazers. Someone that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, and I know very well, Brigadier McKenn, did us the great honour of coming to Port Kembla, taking the salute and staying with us for the whole weekend. That was a tremendous effort in Port Kembla. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the year, I was constantly amazed at the inventiveness of people and the enthusiasm that they showed. We had a couple of rose displays in earlier March. We sponsored a rose display and gave prizes for roses symbolising peace. At that event, and later in August, when there was a more formal Rose Society event, we had a magnificent display of peace roses arranged by Steve Astill, who is a branch member. He made this most magnificent display of peace roses for both occasions. There were many displays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee donated a peace garden outside the Dapto senior citizens centre and community hall. The Wollongong City Council assisted us in preparing the ground. The Illawarra Rose Society also did a lot of work there. We donated the roses. I had great pleasure in October in officially opening it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August, a tremendous display was put on by the Dapto senior citizens at Heininger House in Dapto. This was arranged by someone who is enthusiastic for community activities. We all have one of these people in our community; whenever you want to do something, they are always there. This person was Charlie Farrell, who was a driving force behind it. There was not only this exhibition, which went over a whole weekend, but also a tremendous concert at the end of it, which was really good. During the war, there was a camp there. He got many photographs of it. That was good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A highlight of 8 September was a ball in association with the Roo Theatre. A young student from one of the high schools who was on the Throsby Australia Remembers committee, Julie Hamilton, MC-ed that ball tremendously. For some of us, a highlight the next day was the sponsoring by the Throsby Australia Remembers committee of a nine-race meeting, at which I won a little money. We thought it was good&mdash;not that I won money&mdash;that we had a horse race day. We used the Kembla Grange racecourse for the whole day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that during the war many surf clubs closed down because many young people were away. One of the first to reopen was the Shellharbour surf club in 1945. We sponsored a surf carnival there. I suggested that they wear the costumes of 1945, but people laughed at me and said that they would be all moth-eaten. We had a photographic display there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Unanderra people put on a magnificent display at the Unanderra Railway Station. There was also a very good display at the Albion Park Railway Station and another activity in Unanderra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Warilla RSL arranged a day complete with a parade. On 15 August, we not only had the big stamp launch, again at the battery museum, but also had an activity involving all the young people. That is, 50 trees were planted outside the Breakwater museum and every tree was planted by a veteran and a young person from the primary school. The stories they exchanged when they were doing that were really tremendous. They have all given me a guarantee that they will look after those trees. Again, at the Mount Terry school we planted a lot of trees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people I would like to thank. First of all, I would like to thank Gino Mandarino from my office, who was the coordinating point for all these events. He is a young guy who knows more about war now. He has never experienced one but I think he knows all about it. I would like to thank Jean Gabb and Gordon Streek from the Roo Theatre; Sharon Bird, Tony Kent and Peter Morton from the Breakwater museum; Keith Clemmett and Jack Collins from the Warilla RSL; Ray Wetherall from the Port Kembla RSL; Kevin Gillis from the Tongarra Museum; Lee Cramer from the Shellharbour Council; Bernard Egan from the local Red Cross; Cec Glenholmes, who is the mayor of Shellharbour; Jim Derbyshire from the Tongarra Museum; Bill Taylor and Norm Harrison from the Albion Park RSL; Rebecca Park from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lake Times</EMPHASIS>, who gave us magnificent coverage throughout the year; Frank Larkin from Dapto High School, who coordinated many of the school activities; Alf and Norma Viles from the rural RSL; Sue Kingsford from the Rose Society, and we will have that lasting memorial at the Dapto rose garden; Charlie Farrell, whom I have already mentioned, from the Dapto exhibition; Don Briggs, who did so much arranging for the surf carnival at Shellharbour; and my friend Russell Hannah from the Illawarra Folk Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank the principal, Mrs Margaret Long, and the students of the Mount Terry Public School as well as Mrs Nell Hogan; Steven Astill, whom I have already mentioned, for his magnificent floral arrangement; and Angus Campbell, who was the coordinator for the march and the activities at Port Kembla. Port Kembla continued with activities throughout the whole year. Indeed, next Monday evening I will be there presenting over 100 certificates of appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank Julie Hamilton, who coordinated the ball, and Barry Banks, the principal of Port Kembla school, and his magnificent students. It was the students from the Port Kembla school who went to the Breakwater museum in August. They each selected a veteran&mdash;it was like an old-time selection dance&mdash;and then planted a tree with them. They did not just plant the tree; they talked about the meaning of the day, et cetera. It was a magnificent sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Ken Vaughan from the Western Suburbs Leagues Club; Keith Nolan, who is from the Illawarra Turf Club, who was of such magnificent help to me in arranging the race meeting; Frank Larkin from Dapto High School; Alan Smyth from Australia Post; and Kevin Gillis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank all those who sponsored a race during the meeting. Each race was sponsored, which enabled us to raise some money that we will use. We are going to put out a commemorative book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Throsby Remembered</EMPHASIS>. All through the year we have been collecting articles and photographs&mdash;and I hope I do not feature in too many of them&mdash;so that we can publish them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to table the report by the legal and constitutional affairs committee on the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. The third paragraph states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter was referred to the committee by the House last year. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee has a similar reference. The committee tabled an exposure draft in March this year. Submissions have been received on the exposure draft and the committee has taken these into account in preparing its final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that the task of the parliament is to arrive at the most sensible and practical view of the third paragraph of section 53. The view must be consistent with the broad policy of the section. It should be harmonious with the drafting history of the paragraph and the subsequent course of parliamentary precedent, and the view should be reasonably sustainable within the actual wording of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering how to interpret and apply the third paragraph, the committee has focused on associating the broad policy of section 53 with the purpose of the third paragraph of section 53. The broad policy of section 53 deals with the relationship between the houses in dealing with financial matters, with an emphasis on the effect on the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drafters of the constitution recognised that there had to be a distinction between the powers of the houses in considering money bills. Section 53 provides that the Senate shall have limitations placed on its ability to originate certain bills and to amend certain bills. Where the Senate is prohibited from amending a bill, the fourth paragraph of section 53 provides a mechanism whereby the Senate may request the House of Representatives to amend the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, disputes arise between the houses relating to when the Senate may amend and when it must request amendments. The limitations on the Senate's powers to originate and amend certain money bills are offset to some extent by the provisions of sections 54 and 55, which prevent the House of Representatives from abusing the privileged position in which it is placed by section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad policy of section 53 is often shortened to a simple formula, that section 53 supports the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. Within the section, the general language of the third paragraph ensures that the policy is not applied in a narrow or technical manner. It prevents a bill escaping the net of the broad policy on a technicality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of the committee in interpreting section 53 in general, and the third paragraph in particular, is made more important by the fact that section 53 is not justiciable. The parliament will not be assisted by the High Court in its role as interpreter of the constitution because the section, like section 54, addresses only proposed laws. It is concerned with the fate of a bill during its passage through the legislature, but once the bill is enacted it will not be found invalid because it failed to comply with directions regarding its passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the non-justiciability of section 53 gave the committee a certain flexibility of approach, the committee did not feel able to ignore the High Court's findings on relevant issues. In particular, the committee felt bound to take account of the High Court's interpretation of imposing taxation for the purposes of section 55, because sections 53, 54 and 55 are part of a package designed to achieve the same end. The committee has interpreted the third paragraph of section 53 by taking into account the meaning of imposing taxation in the first paragraph of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been assisted in its task by many very able constitutional experts. I would like to take this opportunity to express thanks to all those who assisted the inquiry, particularly those who participated in the seminar on the topic. This seminar was an important step in identifying and crystallising views on some of the more difficult topics. Thanks go to Mr Lyn Barlin; Professor Tony Blackshield; Professor Michael Coper, the committee's consultant; Mr Harry Evans; Mr Ian Harris; Mr Dennis Rose QC, Professor Cheryl Saunders; Dr James Thomson; and Mr Bernard Wright. I would also like to record my thanks to the secretariat, particularly Judy Middlebrook, Kelly Williams and Michael Wright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that the recommendations may not avoid all the potential problems associated with the application and interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. However, we hope that our report narrows the areas of disagreement between the houses. The committee has maintained its recommendation that there should be a compact between the houses to deal with difficult areas of interpretation. The committee believes that its work will be of assistance to members of parliament, senators and parliamentary officers when issues concerning the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 next arise. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

In Australia the doctrine of separation of powers is not so rigidly applied as it is under the United States constitution. In the United States it is suggested that each arm of government has a separate responsibility for the interpretation of those provisions of the constitution that relate to it.

On the face of it, however, we have no imposition of restraint written into our constitution.

For example, the first paragraph prevents the origination of an appropriation bill or a bill imposing taxation in the Senate and the second paragraph prevents the Senate from amending an annual appropriation bill or a bill imposing taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third paragraph has been a cause of significant difficulties because its relation with the other paragraphs is not clear and the scope of its language is not altogether clear. It has presented difficulties to the executive in preparing legislation and to the Senate and the House in their respective dealings with each other in relation to particular bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has, on a number of occasions, most recently in the case of The State of Western Australia v. Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;the native title case&mdash;affirmed that section 53 is not for them to interpret. Against that background, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had a reference to examine the effect of the third paragraph. Contemporaneously, a corresponding reference was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, now the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the result of the labours of the committee. It is unique, I believe, because it represents a formal opinion of a committee on constitutional questions not raised in a political context but raised more in an abstract context. It is a unanimous report and, therefore, has bipartisan support. It results from what, on my understanding, is one of the most exhaustive studies of such issues undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of its work the committee examined the history of the drafting of the constitution, examined the language of the constitution, looked at the history of the application of section 53 over the years since Federation, looked at relevant High Court decisions, received and studied expert legal opinion, conducted a seminar in which expert constitutional lawyers and members of the committee debated issues, and consulted the clerks of the two houses. </PARA>

In situations not covered directly by the language the committee has recommended how, in practical terms, those situations ought to be dealt with in the future. It recommends a compact between the House and the Senate to provide guidelines for the executive and for the two houses in relation to particular situations. The notion of a compact is not new. There have been two arrangements that can be appropriately described as compacts in the past. It is to be sincerely hoped that this report will generate the third. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This has been one of the most interesting inquiries that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has undertaken. The constitution of Australia has a fascination for lawyers but is a world unknown for the vast number of Australians who are bound by it. This third paragraph of section 53 is perhaps one of the most obscure, but it is certainly one of those paragraphs that has created some conflict and differences between this House and the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The examination of how that difficulty could be resolved has been a very interesting inquiry. I want to thank Judy Middlebrook and the staff of the committee and Daryl Melham for his excellent chairmanship of the committee over the last parliament. It has been in the highest traditions of the process of parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the committee was brought to very successful fruition with the presentation of this report. We took a tough line, basically, on the interpretation of expenditure and raising taxation. Harry Evans from the Senate was pretty compelling when it came to the end of the day, but there were still some areas, we were sure, where there could be possible conflict. So we had the concept of taking a fairly hard interpretation and of saying to governments, `If you are going to introduce legislation into the Senate that raises taxes and have a process of request or amendment, then you are taking a risk. If you want to do that, that is your prerogative, but we basically recommend that appropriation and taxes should be introduced here and amended in this place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may suit government from time to time not to do that and, if the government chooses to ignore that process&mdash;which is basically inherent in the constitution&mdash;then we have set down a suggested process of agreement between the two houses whereby a method can be adopted for the solving of problems and for the prevention of future difficulties. I recommend some portions of this report as required reading for all parliamentarians. I suggest that they should read pages 163 and 164 which epitomise the process that we recommend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There still remains the vexed question, in my view, that there could arise circumstances where a government is proposing a tax cut, where the Senate makes an amendment which actually increases taxation, but not to the extent that it raises taxes to the original level before the tax cut was proposed. Had John Hewson been successful at the last election when he had said, `I want to cut personal income tax and have a substitute tax,' it would have been possible for the Senate to destroy the intention of the government by saying, `Well, we don't think personal income tax should be cut to that extent.' They could then have moved an amendment increasing the level of taxation above where the government wanted it to be but still beneath the original level then applying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a situation we have not dealt with. The interpretations by the High Court have been strict&mdash;the increase in taxation should be applied rigorously. I want to thank all those involved, and I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The question of whether or not the financial powers of this place are replicated in any measure by some interpretations of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution is important for two reasons. The first is that if, as a product of a disagreement between the houses, the product of section 57 of the constitution is brought into effect and there is a base from which a double dissolution can be called, there is quite a significant consequence. But determining the limits of financial authority of the House of Representatives was really very much in the minds of our constitutional forebears when the terms of section 53 were first drafted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the course of my time in this place, there have been a number of instances where we have had discussions and some disagreements as to the actual capacity of the Senate to request or to amend legislation. The purpose of this report is to try to narrow the area of difference and to suggest that there are areas where a compact might now be drawn, hopefully leading to a satisfactory resolution of those differences, so that it will not be necessary either for the question of the application of the third paragraph of section 53 to be justiciable or for there to be an application of section 57 and the processes for the dissolution of the two houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is really a very good appraisal of a situation of very considerable importance in the practical application of a bicameral legislature. It is important that we try to find ways, where there is any confusion in interpretation, to adopt&mdash;as we have sought in this instance&mdash;criteria which we believe can be accepted without in any way prejudicing the authority and ability of the Senate. We have drawn attention in a number of instances in our recommendations to procedures which we think can be adopted by the Senate which will avoid the inevitable problem that might otherwise flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have been given the very generous 3 1/2 minutes in which to cover the whole of the interpretation of the Australian constitution, I really have not time to say much more. I did want to say three practical things about the report. This report is one of the better reports that has come out in this parliament, and I commend the chairman, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), for his initiative and enthusiasm not only in the drafting of the report but in the conduct of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are interested in the subject and who decide to read the report and consider it in detail will note that we had a very interesting seminar which brought together some leading exponents in constitution law, and that too was an initiative which I thought well worth while. I would like to express thanks to those who participated, Professor Blackshield and others, all of whom I thought made a valuable contribution. Not the least of those was the man who sits silently to the right of the Speaker in this place, and that is the Clerk of the parliament, together with the Deputy Clerk and others. We are indebted to him for his help in the interpretation of the provisions and the application of the third paragraph of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to express thanks, as others have, to the secretariat of the committee. Judy Middlebrook is an absolute godsend. She is one of the outstanding members of the secretarial staff of this parliament, and we are very fortunate to have had her assistance. Listed in the report is a number of other staff members, some of whom were seconded from Attorney-General's and some of whom from the university gave help but all of whom played a particular role. Judy Middlebrook, Kelly Williams, Michael Wright, Professor Michael Coper, Di Singleton and Annabel Lamb have each made a very worthwhile contribution to the committee. I thank them for their role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say to the other members of the committee that I think it has been an interesting report, an interesting study. The product more than justifies the time and effort that they have put into it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;An inquiry into the operations of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution is a subject of continuing relevance to the procedure operation of our democratic system. This exercise has been important, because in assessing the competing views presented throughout the inquiry we have come closer to discovering the proper relationship between the comparative powers and responsibilities of the respective houses. The tabling of the final report on the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 is an event worthy of note; so I am pleased to have this opportunity, albeit short, to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report makes 13 recommendations which the houses can foster in reaching a workable interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. The committee has sought an objective analysis and the interpretation is one designed to preserve the intention of the drafters of the constitution; principally, that the House of Representatives should have the initiative and principal responsibility in relation to financial matters. The committee has considered a number of factors relevant to the interpretation of this section; namely, the policy behind section 53, parliamentary practice, the drafting history of the third paragraph, the plain meaning of the words of the paragraph, the opinions of eminent lawyers and commentators, and the practicality and workability of interpretations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although arguments about the justiciability of section 53 can be sustained, the committee has concluded that the provisions of section 53 are non-justiciable, as the High Court recently affirmed in the state of Western Australia v. Commonwealth of Australia [Mabo (No.3)]. Thus, in the absence of judicial pronouncements, the houses would seem to remain bound by the legal meaning of the provisions of the section. In the opinion of the committee, the task of the parliament thus is to arrive at the most sensible and practical view of the third paragraph of section 53 that is consistent with the broad policy of the section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After taking evidence from vast numbers of people and hearing particularly from the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the committee considered that a test should be applied to determine whether an alteration in the Senate increases the proposed charge or burden on the people. I have spoken previously of my preference for the availability test. This test determines an increase in expenditure by considering whether the amendment would have increased the amount available for expenditure, whether or not any of the extra amount would be likely to have been spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When parliament makes more money available to the executive, that is a burden on the people, regardless of whether the money is actually spent. This test is most capable of application, in that it is clear and unambiguous. It does curtail the power of the Senate to amend bills that authorise expenditure. In my view, this is consistent with the broad policy of section 53; that is, to maintain the principle of preserving the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends that the Senate should be required to make a request to the House of Representatives where an alteration to a bill is moved in the Senate which makes an increase in the expenditure available under the appropriation, or the total tax or charge, possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report includes a statement of principles for possible inclusion in a compact. The objective of the compact would be to assist in the practical workings of the parliamentary process, and to define and limit the constitutional powers of both houses. It is the committee's view that these principles could form an innovative step in establishing a better dialogue between the respective houses. Such a compact is not to be between the government and the Senate but between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee recognises that both houses will need to be prepared to make concessions to reach a workable agreement. Consensus would not be easy. However, I believe that the establishment of a compact would indeed be a progressive undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preparation of the report has taken considerable hours of work&mdash;up to two years of work&mdash;for a 3 1/2-minute speech by me, which is slightly ironic. I acknowledge the secretariat, the chairman and also Judy Middlebrook, the committee secretary. She could write a book on section 53(3) in her long-off retirement&mdash;not that it would sell particularly well. I thank the secretariat and my colleagues. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>In so moving, I might explain generally to the House the government's position on all the amendments. This will save us time as we proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill passed through this chamber some six months ago and was eventually considered by the Senate on 20 September 1995 when four substantive amendments were carried. Two of those amendments were of a minor nature but involved changes to seven clauses. The government will accept the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the opposition wants the provision of electoral gender information on the Commonwealth electoral role to be supplied to parliamentarians and political parties. This course is not supported by the Privacy Commissioner who has been anxious to protect electors from harassment by commercial interests. The Privacy Commissioner's concerns are obviously genuine and I recognise the strength of his case. All the same, the government is not prepared to lose the many other good things in the bill over this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the opposition wishes to remove the cost cutting measure which would have allowed the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise in one instead of two newspapers. The government is relaxed about this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 3 and 4 go to much more substantial issues. The government actually supports the spirit of the opposition's amendments in both cases but cannot agree with the manner in which they have been drafted. The third amendment seeks to eliminate discrimination against polling officials over 65 years of age. The problem arose when the Australian Electoral Commission announced that, because it was not feasible to provide appropriate workers compensation cover for those aged over 65, the AEC could not assume the risk of taking them on as casuals at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a Public Service wide problem and the government has since agreed to legislate to ensure the appropriate coverage. Unfortunately, there is insufficient time to put those changes in place before the 1996 election. I take the view that it is not sensible to create an anomaly with the Electoral Commission staff by giving them rights not enjoyed by the rest of the Australian Public Service. Instead, I have argued that we should solve the problem of the 1996 election by administrative means: namely, by the Australian Electoral Commission taking out private workers compensation cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the AEC is an independent body and not subject to my direction on administrative matters. The commission has, however, agreed to take whatever steps are necessary to allow over-65s to be employed as polling clerks at the next election. I think this means that the opposition amendment is redundant. It is right that it is redundant. Moreover, it has been drafted in such a manner that there is some legal doubt that it would have the effect that the opposition intended. In those circumstances, my submission is that the opposition should not press this amendment and should direct their Senate colleagues to take a similar view. In any event, we will oppose the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment is the contentious one. It deals with the recurring saga of truth in political advertising. I will not delay the House with a long history of the many failed attempts to legislate to ensure that political parties and candidates are brought to book if they tell lies in election propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be said is that the government made it clear when the Senate debated the Democrats amendment to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill that we agree with the principle of truth in advertising but we do not agree with the form of the amendment that was carried. Our objection was based on the fact that, despite the assertion by the Democrats that their amendment reproduces verbatim the South Australian legislation, this is not the case at all. Indeed, there are very significant legal differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats persist with this false assertion, they could end up being prosecuted under their own amendment. The South Australian law makes it a criminal offence to print, publish or distribute during elections electoral advertisements containing statements that are inaccurate and misleading to a significant extent. The Democrats amendment is far wider in that, instead of catching only statements of fact, it embraces statements generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, instead of statements only offending if they are inaccurate in a significantly misleading way, the Democrats would now make it a crime to advertise in a way that is untrue and likely to be misleading or deceptive. That is a totally different concept involving the assessment of opinions and value judgments. We ask: why restrict the crime to advertising? It strikes me as passing strange that we should require truth in our newspaper, radio and television advertisements but still allow the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and others to run around the country, as they have been, equivocating about their policies and prevaricating about things such as overseas debt and interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also want to put a stop to other highly objectionable methods of disseminating falsehoods about Labor candidates currently being used by the Liberal Party. I refer in particular to the disgusting American style political practice of telephone push polling as employed by the Liberal Party candidate for Eden-Monaro, Mr Gary Nairn, and as employed in the last Northern Territory election and in the Canberra by-election. The Liberal Party in those elections employed pollsters to spread false, highly defamatory material about Labor candidates to their constituents. We take the view that, if it is wrong to tell untruths in ordinary advertising, it is just as wrong to defame candidates by telephone, facsimile machines or direct mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also some doubt about the constitutionality of a proposed restriction on freedom of political communication in the light of the recent free speech cases decided by the High Court. As I have already stated, the government has serious problems with the shift in the amendment from the South Australian approach of the strict liability concept of inaccurate statements to embrace the much vaguer concept of material that is untrue or simply likely to mislead. In the South Australian case of Cameron v. Beckett, the statement that was found to be inaccurate was that it was Liberal Party policy to close all schools with under 200 pupils. That was found to be an inaccurate statement of fact by the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Democrats amendment takes us into a world of intangibles, of value judgment. The South Australian Liberals' policy may not actually state, and did not actually state, that all schools with under 200 pupils would be closed. But it may well be the inevitable outcome of a proposed budget cut or a change in staffing arrangements and it may be perfectly appropriate to ask voters to draw such a conclusion. Do we really want to be bogged down in endless litigation about contentious value judgments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other glaring deficiencies in the amendment. The most obvious is the perennial problem of different sets of laws on the subject around the country. This issue cries out for uniform electoral laws. We really have to put an end to election lies like those of John Fahey in the last New South Wales election, who ran fraudulent newspaper advertisements saying that a Labor government would bring in new taxes costing $15 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national and state offices of the Labor Party have indicated that they would like to see national legislation along the lines of the South Australian act and have suggested that COAG should put that issue on its agenda. The government is considering that option but, in the meantime, takes the view that this amendment should be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which currently has a reference on push polling. Accordingly, I will be moving at another stage that this amendment be referred to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other glaring deficiency is the puny penalty being imposed&mdash;a miserable $1,000 fine. The man who is prepared to stand up publicly and utter the barefaced lie that all Australians owe a personal debt of $10,000 in respect of overseas borrowing by private Australian companies would not be concerned by having to pay a fine of a few hundred dollars. The Trade Practices Act imposes gaol sentences and massive fines for very similar deceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the same section of the Electoral Act being amended at the moment imposes six months gaol for false handbills, pamphlets and notices. If it is good enough to go to gaol for six months for putting out a false pamphlet, why shouldn't you go to gaol for running a long television advertisement that is just as false and deceptive? It seems to me that a $1,000 fine is a joke and indicates that the Democrats and the opposition are not at all serious with this amendment. They are doing it for political advantage, not to produce legislation that is real or effective. If they were genuine about this issue they would impose a realistic penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I summarise the government's position on the Senate's schedule of 10 substantive and seven consequential amendments. We accept amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and we oppose the rest. The government is also proposing new amendments to the bill in relation to funding and disclosure. In June 1995 amendments were passed to the Electoral Act allowing registered parties to enter agreements to redirect payments of election funding between themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, the government made a commitment to the Australian Democrats that it would broaden these provisions to take into account the Democrat structure, as opposed to that of other political parties. The Democrats are different in their constitutional structure. We have acknowledged this and the fact that they have a special problem in this regard because they have a network of unregistered state branches, as opposed to the other major parties which have registered state branches. The government is now fulfilling that commitment. These amendments provide the Democrats with an option of requiring all payments of election funding throughout the party to be directed to the registered national organisation. I understand that the opposition supports this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing to take the amendments even further and extend to all parties the option of entering into election funding agreements. It will allow parties in unregistered state branches to enter agreements with those branches to redirect funding for payments. This overcomes the current anomaly whereby only registered state branches are able to enter such agreements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important piece of legislation, made so principally by the fact that everyone in this House is well aware of the reality that over the next few months we will be going into one of the most hard fought electoral campaigns possibly in recent electoral history. Having said that, we had hoped that the government would be at least honest to its own claims and take the opportunities presented in the Senate&mdash;over recent months the minister has made the point that this is not exactly recent legislation&mdash;to address some of the issues raised here and in the Senate by opposition parties, including the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the government has chosen to support some of these amendments which are essentially of a non-contentious nature&mdash;those relating to electoral funding and electoral matters&mdash;is well and good. There are, however, two issues at stake which are worthy of serious consideration, even at this late stage. I note, for example, the observations of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) in relation to the provisions for people aged 65 and over not to be permitted to work for the AEC in the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note his proposal that as the AEC is a semi- or quasi-government instrumentality only it should be authorised to enter into a private arrangement to ensure that workers compensation is provided for those people. That is definitely a step forward but, as I have pointed out in this House on many occasions, we have now introduced no fewer than four pieces of legislation, two in the Senate and two in this chamber, on the issue of age discrimination. It remains in every sense of the term a fundamental blot on the escutcheon of this government's approach to human rights and to values relating to people over the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like probably all other members, have been absolutely amazed at the flow of correspondence we have received from workers normally employed by the AEC who have received letters saying: `Sorry, you are healthy in every respect, you do a great job, but we don't want to see you at the next election because you are aged 65 and because we have received legal advice that the workers compensation provisions may not relate to you.' The very fact that it has taken such a long time in the parliamentary context to address the issue demonstrates so clearly that this government could not care a damn about those people. They are retirees, for the most part. Many of them are retired teachers. They do not have large incomes. They want to supplement them at election time. They have done this work  year in and year out and they have done it very well indeed. That is why we have persisted in taking the view that the legislation should have been amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise two important points in this regard. The cabinet only a few weeks ago agreed to accept in principle that persons over the age of 65 should be entitled to remain in employment. I trust that principle also applies to the rights of those people to seek employment in the public sector. The fact that that decision has been made by the cabinet, the fact that in this parliament only this week I was able to prevail upon the government to accept my amendment to change the rules to allow people involved in the Superannuation Review Tribunal to work beyond the age of 65&mdash;which previously the act quite clearly forbade&mdash;puts this into stark contrast and ask the question: why is the government in this legislation not prepared to take a similar step forward? It is completely inconsistent that it accepts it in relation to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal but it does not accept it in relation to the AEC or to other government instrumentalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is ignoring its own recent cabinet decision. It is ignoring a determination made by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) in relation to Betty Churcher's re-employment beyond the age of 65 as the director of the National Gallery of Australia. You have agreed to these changes but in this case you are not prepared to take the necessary step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple statistical fact is that there are only 81 permanent public servants aged over 65. We are an ageing society. We are a healthier ageing society. It is in the national interest and in the individual's interest to give people opportunities, especially part time, to be employed for as long as they are able. It is totally unacceptable for the minister to come in here and put forward the view that it is too difficult to change legislation, when on his own admission he has had some months in which to take that through to its inevitable conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the second amendment, which is a matter of considerable concern to us, and that is the question of truth in advertising. We find the government once again being caught out on its own rhetoric. For example, its own national director, Gary Gray, recently said publicly that he supported truth in advertising legislation. He backed that up by saying that he also had the support of all the state leaders of the Labor Party for this proposal. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear that from the minister, but what we have not heard from the minister in this debate is, if the government is so keen about truth in advertising, why is it that, in the months it has had available to it, it was not able to at least put forward a progressive amendment to the Democrat proposal which could have been acceptable to the Senate and acceptable to the opposition in this place?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the best we have got out of the minister is that he wants to refer the whole thing to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I happen to be for my sins deputy chairman of that committee. We have had a lot of trouble in getting a unanimous report on the issue of push polling. The prospects are that we will not. The reason is that the government consistently argues that it wants to be able to take a specific position in relation to push polling in terms of the Northern Territory experience, the ACT experience or the Queensland experience. Common sense would tell you that, if you want to make progress on a complex issue like this, where definitional issues are very difficult, it is better not to play politics on what has happened in the past but to try to agree to a set of principles which you can apply for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not how this government wants to play it. This government wants to have its cake and eat it and be ultimately in the situation where nothing will be done about issues such as push polling. You want to be able to enter into the next federal election campaign without any strictures of a legal nature on what you will be able to say about coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know your capacity in this area. We suffered grievously in the last election campaign over the GST and other issues. We know from the evidence which has been tabled in this House and brought forward in recent weeks that the ACTU, through the union movement, is already establishing the structures for a major campaign based on two words: fear and loathing. There is fear of what a coalition may do and loathing about the implications of change in any area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Editorial comment in the daily press makes the point that this parliament is failing the Australian people and the political process. If we are going to go into a situation where a party simply will not enter into debate on issues because the opponent will not take the issue on its merits but will simply directly establish a position where fear and loathing of any form of change will be the arbiter of the political process in this country, is it any wonder that the opposition totally and utterly rejects such a position? Is there any reason, therefore, why we should support in any shape or form the proposition put forward by the minister here today, which is that truth in advertising at the legislative level is simply far too complicated and difficult?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the minister referred to a case that has recently been before the High Court. He called it the free speech case. It was well and truly so. Let us take the free speech case for what it is worth. Since when has this parliament abrogated to the High Court its responsibility for determining the law of this land? Some people would say that you did in the Mabo case. But you do not have to do it on issues such as this. This parliament alone is the responsible body for determining the laws of the Commonwealth. It is the responsibility of the High Court to interpret those laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have been told here by the minister is that it is all too difficult. I acknowledge that it is a free speech case which complicates the issue, but that is not in itself a sufficient argument for simply saying that free speech should not be the arbiter of the exercise and that truth in advertising is something that can therefore be ignored and perhaps put off for another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you examine in detail precisely what the Democrat amendment was all about, you find that these are the key words. It states:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)that is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, in the normal course of events, all those words are subject to testing through the legal process. The test on whether something is true or untrue is a statement ultimately of fact. The testing of whether something is misleading or deceptive is ultimately the case of how it affects the person who is reading that material and how they will react to it.

The fact that you have a parliamentary system now where ministers do not even have to come in here on a daily basis to give an account of their stewardship to the opposition, to the parliament as a whole and through them to the Australian people is a clear demonstration of the arrogance that has come with too many years in government, too many years of absolute power. </PARA>

We have got the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) doing things that will change the benefits to families but denying that he has made those changes, telling me in the parliament that assurances have been given and everything is right. That is completely wrong. We have got the Treasurer (Mr Willis) saying the economy is on track and everything is going to be right. We are still running a deficit of a billion and a half dollars month after month, which is going to keep interest rates high and which is going to force unemployment up, but you are going to deny that. You are saying that we have so much growth that everything is going to be terrific. Lies, supposition and falsehood are going to be the basis of the election campaign that you are going to run. If that is not the case, if you are not going to run a campaign of that type, you have the easy proposal here right in front of you today to accept that there should be truth in advertising for election campaigns. It has gone through the processes in the Senate and it has gone through the processes properly. You can easily move to a point where you adopt this legislation. Pick up the Senate amendments and you will find that you will have support on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I instance some of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister over the years, particularly prior to the last election. I have got here pages of promises that you made that you have not delivered on; pages and pages of them. Some of them are extraordinary. I thank my colleague Senator Jim Short for producing this list just after the election campaign in l993. Do you want me to read some of them? This just goes to prove the point that you intend to make commitments to the Australian people. There were things like free dental care under Medicare and purchasing private hospitals beds. We remember all of those things; we have got them listed. We have got listed all of the promises that you have broken, and it is your intention to make the same promises, to fabricate a campaign based on lies and falsehood, encouraged by the advice of the ACTU to make your campaign one of fear and loathing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these promises that you have made are terrific because they affected great sections of the Australian community, but they are all lies. They include allowing superannuation to be used to purchase homes and establishing an Asian economic centre. Right across the board there is this wish list of stuff: establishing a department of regional development; expanding group employment and training. You have done that, but the trouble is that you are changing them so frequently they are not getting results. As my colleague at the table, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has said here time and again, many of these programs, involving the outlay of millions of dollars, are not producing the results that you have claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the free dental care under Medicare. There was the expansion of post-acute palliative care; the extension of eligibility for the development allowance&mdash;minister after minister has put a shopping list in. You announced the lot prior to the last election as being your policy and your intention. There was the abolition of the waiting period for the jobsearch allowance; child-care cash rebates&mdash;you fiddled around with that and the legislation has been through the House. There was Commonwealth Development Bank extra funding&mdash;you do not even know what you are going to do with the Commonwealth Development Bank, but it is going to be caught up in the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. All of these promises you made prior to the last election. They were false, they were lies, and you knew they were lies because you knew you could never pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way you can abolish the lack of credibility that you have got in the eyes of the Australian community is to bring in these amendments so that in the next election campaign, right from today, there will be no political party in Australia prepared to run false and misleading advertising for the Australian people. But, no, you are going to reject this legislation; you are going to reject these amendments. The opposition is going to vote for them. You are going to place yourself in the prospect, Minister, of voting against the provisions of this amendment saying that there should be truth in advertising; that advertising should not be misleading. You are going to vote that down. You are going to vote against truth; you are going to vote against integrity in advertising. The fact is that it will reinforce the community attitudes against you, against the Australian Labor Party and in particular against the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just been reminded of your promises about superannuation. I could go on and on and on about the promises that you have made and the promises you have broken, and the advertising that you have put out that has been false and misleading. You have the opportunity of rectifying that and putting integrity back into the perception of the Australian Labor Party, but you are rejecting the whole process. It is a sad day for the Australian parliament and it is a sad day for the Australian people. Here is your one chance to rectify many problems and you are rejecting it. You are going to vote against truth and integrity in political advertising. It is a great shame. Shame on you, Minister, and shame on your party for contemplating that there should be lies and misleading statements accepted as part of advertising in election campaigns in Australia. It is a great shame you have decided to do this. You had the option of coming clean and doing it well but that is not your intention for the next election. We know what sort of a campaign to expect: fear and loathing and lies will be the theme of the campaign. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives does not agree to amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 10 of the Senate for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment No. 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment was proposed to ensure the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) could employ election casuals past the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment made encompasses all staff of the AEC including those employed under the Public Service Act 1922 but does not alter the circumstances of election casuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment creates an anomaly in the terms and conditions of employment provided in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Public Service Act 1922 for permanent public servants.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment No.</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">8</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment deals with the regulation of truth in political advertising during an election period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment made by the Senate is an attempt to re-insert in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, section 329(2), which was repealed in 1984 after only 6 months in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 329(2) was repealed on the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform, which in its Second Report of August 1984, gave extensive consideration to the operation of the provision, and concluded that it was not possible to effectively regulate truth in political advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A decade later, in the November 1994 Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the issue of truth in political advertising was again given extensive consideration, and once again the Committee recommended against legislation of the kind contained in the former section 329(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also some doubt about the constitutionality of such a proposed restriction on freedom of political communication in the light of the recent "Free Speech" cases decided by the High Court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to this ministerial statement, it has been appropriate that 1995 has been a year when Australians have had a chance to not only remember but also gain information about a World War in which Australia's democracy was preserved through the sacrifices of many people who served overseas and in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without knowing the actual statistics, I would imagine that 50 per cent of the Australian population today would not have been alive during the war or at its cessation. It was always going to be a very important part of this year to provide our young people with the culture of what Australia was like and what we were fighting for in that war. I found that aspect the most appropriate part of the whole program. I understand that time will have dimmed the recollection of the event and the process of recording of the events will have altered the reality. A glaring example of that is to try to understand the hardships and what people sacrificed for Australia and the free world to bring the war to a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall quite vividly that one of the projects that was early mooted was to involve the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, those people who participated so closely with Australian troops in New Guinea. While we just could not make the connection to bring them to Mackay or into Dawson to relate the events, the project was successfully concluded in Townsville. Townsville is a bigger centre and has more to remember from the war, and it was a successful event in bringing the present generation to a realisation of what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Australia Remembers 1995 was very important in assisting Australians to regain some of the culture of the war and to appreciate how much has been lost in the meantime, time has also dimmed people's realisation of what might have happened if it had not have been for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings&mdash;a subject that has already been referred to in the House. It is not always understood that the war would have continued to grind on with greater sacrifices by the Japanese and the allied forces if it had not been for the bombings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is by no means saying that the current French nuclear tests are not to be decried. I think we all find them abhorrent, but it is nevertheless important to remember the situation in 1945 that brought the allies to that point and to understand that they were the means by which the war was successfully prosecuted so soon after that event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the committee that brought the program together. We operated on the basis that the celebration was not to be political and, as a result, we managed to have employer organisations, union movement delegates and the RSLs on the committee. I have to mention the chairman of the committee, Mr Kevin Plumb, the Chairman of the Mackay Regional RSL, himself a Vietnam veteran and a chap who was perhaps not even born at the cessation of hostilities. We invited the RSL to act as a trust fund so that accounts received could be paid out. I pay tribute to those people from the RSL, the councils and other organisations which helped out in such a meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mackay could not really celebrate as many of the other northern centres could because, even though it is in North Queensland and it was north of the Brisbane Line, Mackay was not actively involved in the war. However, the allied fleet anchored at Cid Harbour in the Whitsunday Islands before it engaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea. That was probably the first naval engagement where the ships were not in sight of each other&mdash;they fought each other from aircraft carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mackay was also a rest and recreation area for a lot of Americans during the war. That was part of the war experience of many of the people in Mackay who were trying to make this celebration possible. As a result of that, the celebrations centred around the people who stayed at home and kept the war effort going&mdash;the youngsters, the women and men, the members of the Volunteer Defence Corps&mdash;the people who are often not recognised for their contribution to the war effort. It was an opportunity to finally recognise their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects of our celebrations that I want to speak about. I mentioned the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels and the fact that we did not quite make that connection. The Mackay Genealogical Society was given nearly $2,000 to prepare a booklet on the historical sites of Mackay during the war. We have been able to circulate those booklets. I would like to congratulate the people who made that effort possible. Perhaps that will be a handbook for the future. People can look at it and say, `These are the highlights. These are the landmarks. This is what World War II meant to Mackay. This is what remains.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect was that a United States carrier plane crashed on take-off from Mackay airport, killing all but one of those on board. The celebration of Australia Remembers provided an opportunity to mark their sacrifice in a very meaningful way. It is important to remember that the war was won not by Australian efforts alone but by the efforts of many allies in the field, including those from the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fashionable these days to knock the United States, but there is a general feeling in North Queensland that, had it not been for the intervention of the United States, and in particular General MacArthur, we might have been defending Australia from the Brisbane Line instead of defending it from the north of Australia. The United States played a very important part in the war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Mackay region we decided that it was important to put the culture of the war in its place. We wanted it to be relevant to the students of the schools in the area. We ran a competition which offered prizes for the first five placegetters&mdash;in other words, there were going to be five winners&mdash;within the schools based on the way in which they participated in the celebrations during that year. We made sure that we would not be held up to any criticism by appointing somebody from outside as the judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were a little disappointed that the number of participating schools was a lot lower than we expected. However, the quality of the work of those who did participate was very good. I would just like to mention some of the comments made by the judge on that occasion. In connection with Calen school&mdash;a small school in a small community which during the war would have had a very high percentage of enrolments in the armed forces&mdash;the judge said that the school was obviously steeped in remembrance of 15 August 1945. Because it was a small school, he said that it was great that it was included. He also said that they reported well on the effects of the war on civilians as well as service people. Calen school also commemorated the arrival of the troop train, which was another central theme throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dundula school was particularly important because that was the school that was involved closely in the crash of the transport aircraft that I mentioned before. They prepared a roll of those people who served and they also prepared a video. The following comments were made by the judge:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The school made excellent mileage of the activities in their area of the Honour Roll, VP Day, and the Bakers Creek memorial by photographs and Video.</PARA>
<PARA>They also presented an album which I was able to see. The judge's comment was that the album was well presented, although the hand-written submissions by pupils at the end were almost indecipherable. But, when you had a look at it, it was a good effort with the video supported by the album. A former student made sure there was a 50th anniversary `return to the school'. There was the honour roll. The whole thing was beautifully done. Although it is only a small school, Dundula will remember participating in this event for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finch Hatton is notorious because that is the place I was born&mdash;I am sure you would be interested in that, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and, of course, the Finch Hatton State School received a bit of encouragement from the local member. In his comments on the school's submission, the judge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well presented report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anzac Day involvement and the address by the principal excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visual reporting and the article `Memories are legacy of boy's war' allied to the VP celebrations are very good.</PARA>
<PARA>I went back there for the 50th anniversary&mdash;not of the war remembrance but because it was the 50th anniversary of when a group had left that school. I was back there and part of it, and the students of the day were going around with a tape recorder, speaking to the oldies about their memories of what the school was like at that time and how Finch Hatton had participated in the war. That was excellently done. In his comments on Mackay North Primary, the judge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This entry is I think outstanding in achieving education of the children by their involvement in all activities.</PARA>
<PARA>That was what we were looking at. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All exercises are designed to do just that. There is little said of the teachers taking direct participation but they are obviously there guiding in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this was instilling in the young people's minds that their participation was the important thing, not that of the teachers. So it was self-generating. The comments went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The children also do an exercise on defence and also the efforts required to maintain peace which was excellent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the submission from Mirani State High School, the comments were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An excellent idea to start working on the theme, generating interest and collecting material prior to the fifteenth. An impressive VP Day museum has resulted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>They had their parade and ceremony on a Sunday after VJ Day. As far as I was concerned, the war museum aspect was a great delight. In another comment, the judge said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gave our school the opportunity to talk about values, about what it means to be bound by common purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that was the intended thrust of the whole thing. So that was another very good result. The comment on Victoria Park State School's submission was that it was `a well put together report'. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large part taken up with The Rats Of Tobruk. The school is fortunate in having a Memorial Pool and a Memorial Garden.</PARA>
<PARA>The pool and garden were part of their celebration and commemoration of this event. Those old diggers, the Rats of Tobruk, made it a practice to adopt a school and talk to the students to let them know what had happened. You can imagine the effect on a young child of somebody talking about those experiences&mdash;not the blood, the gore, the sweat and everything else but why they went. It gave new meaning to a lot of people about what the flag and the monarchy represents, but more importantly what the democracy we now have represents and why it is appreciated by others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the school competition, the judge also gave a special commendation to the Whitsunday Anglican School. So we ended up by giving not five prizes but seven. It was, I believe, something that was particularly beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My memory of the war is of a King of England and a Queen who supported him at every turn during the Battle of Britain. That was the greatest inspiration I had as a kid about what it meant to be part of a democracy and in a big family. I have decided to send a certificate of recognition to the Queen Mother in her 95th year. I believe that of all the people who were involved at that time she, along with the King of England, gave the greatest inspiration and has helped Australia to remember. It will be my delight to be able to send that to her on behalf of not only the residents of Dawson but I hope all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great privilege to be able to speak in this debate because this year has been a very special one and everyone who has spoken on the Australia Remembers program will agree with that. It has meant different things to different people. You would be hard pressed to find a family anywhere in Australia that has not in some way been affected by the war. In my case, my father was in the navy all his working life and, of course, he was away at that time. I was born just before the war so my childhood memories are of the war. However, for a lot of people born since then they have had parents and grandparents who were involved in the Second World War. The memories run across families in Australia and each has their own different memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a good time to be able to thank those who paid a great sacrifice for our democracy, those who gave their lives, those who came back injured in body or mind, and those whose families have been destroyed as a result of that war. Their sacrifice has been enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program also gave us the chance to thank those who worked on the home front. No war can proceed without that support at home. I am referring to those who were involved in the manufacture of armaments, the growing of food, the provision of clothing and the provision of medical services for those who came back injured. It has been a time for pulling all of that together and to say thank you to all of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been a time for those people involved in various aspects of the war to get together again. We have seen in the newspapers a lot of people who have met up with their comrades for the first time since their war experiences. I have had women in my electorate who have met up with other women who were in the VADs together or the Land Army, and that has been very rewarding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of television programs this year about the war and that has been very educational. As a child I saw a lot of those things but there were new programs. The two that stick in my mind the most were the one about the Kokoda Trail and the one more recently about the Sandakan death marches. I found that latter one extremely moving and most people who saw it would have had tears streaming down their faces at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following day I attended the end of year lunch for our ex-servicewomen's association and I asked one of the women if she had watched it. She said, `No, I could not. My husband was a doctor in the army and he went to that area after the war to look after some of those people who were left and to see what had happened and he was never the same.' So even those who were not in the middle of it, who experienced only the aftermath and saw what had happened to those people, had their lives altered too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of that program that probably disturbed most of us was the woman who was the daughter of one of the half dozen survivors who said that her father, who later on became a soldier settler, used to walk around the house at night yelling out the names of Japanese soldiers. He had threatened her mother with a gun and in the end he shot himself. Not being able to live with the results of something like that is just too awful to think about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had only one person in my electorate who said, `Why are you doing this? You are commemorating war. You are celebrating war.' That made me think about why we were doing it and I think for all the reasons I have just spoken of it was the right thing to do. But also, and more importantly, it was designed to educate the younger generation. What the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has said is absolutely true and I am glad he spent so much time talking about schools. Those young people need to appreciate the sacrifice that was made for them and their families. Also, they must learn from that experience and see that we do not repeat it. That is enormously important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of commemorative events. We all know about the national ones and we all had our own committees for our commemorations. I had two committees in my electorate because my electorate breaks into two distinct halves as it is divided by a valley. I had one committee in the Blue Mountains and one in the Hawkesbury. They decided to do different kinds of events, the things that were suited to their part of the electorate best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events in the Hawkesbury included a concert involving old time songs at the Windsor function centre and a race day at the Hawkesbury race club. Racing and horse breeding are quite prominent in that area and so a race day was the thing they chose. It was a wet day, unfortunately, and I have memories of trying to hold up an umbrella while presenting the jockey with his award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best and most enjoyable things for me and one of the most permanent things in the Hawkesbury area was a tree planting exercise. I know a lot of areas did this. The trees form what is now known as the memorial drive, suitably marked on the road that links Richmond and Windsor and runs alongside the RAAF base. Every time I drive along there now I see these plane trees growing, and that is a permanent memorial. There was a display at the Hawkesbury Council library and a school essay competition which again was very well supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both areas there were school visits by members of the RSL and also civilians from that time. I went on one of the Blue Mountains school visits myself&mdash;it was the only one I managed to get the time to go to&mdash;and talked about what it was like to be a child during the war. When I talked about my mother making my knickers out of old sheets, the little girls squirmed a bit at the thought of what that must have felt like, and it did not feel good, I have to tell you. I told them about sitting around the radio at night with my mother and my sister singing all those songs. Now when those things are being played I find that I can sing all the words to them but I cannot sing any of the words to more modern songs. Of course, we did not have television, which was another thing that the children found quite amazing. The school visits were very important, and the school essays and projects were a very prominent part of these events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the mountains we had a most enjoyable evening, a cabaret called `Songs of Survival'. It had been previously performed at the Q Theatre at Penrith. This was about women in prisoner of war camps in Asia and the Japanese camps. It was set backstage at a performance of songs written by the women prisoners. They talked about their experiences, but also about the intrusion of people who were trying to promote the event but who were not involved and did not have an appreciation of their experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a VE Day street party at Lawson. Unfortunately the weather was not too good, so we had to take a lot of it indoors. That involved a service and, again, a lot of children being involved, putting flowers on the memorial for people from their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big event in the mountains was a VP Day parade organised by the Katoomba RSL and including RSLs from all over the district&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another ceremony that I found very moving, and this was actually at the RAAF base in Richmond. It was to launch a restoration project for a Mosquito aircraft which had been found derelict in a field somewhere in the district. There was enough there to identify it as the one that was flown by one of my constituents, Mr Harvey Armour, who is currently in a nursing home. He was taken down in a wheelchair to this event and an appeal was launched for the restoration. I am delighted that the Minister for Defence is allowing the RAAF base to carry out that work. Looking at that aircraft, I was impressed by how flimsy and fragile it was. Those planes were made of wood, and it must have been very risky flying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also, like most people, had a visit from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), and I think all of us join in congratulating him for his unbounded enthusiasm during this year. The first thing we did on his visit was to go to Blaxland East Primary School, where we looked at a display put together by the year 4 students. They had done posters and projects and books, and they had done all of the research themselves, very often from their grandparents, or they had gone to the library and had cuttings from books and pictures and so on. They were excellent, and they really did show that they had gone into this very deeply. We also had morning and afternoon teas with various RSL clubs, a service and a lunch with my two Australia Remembers committees. During that lunch the minister presented a civilian award to a gentleman on behalf of his deceased father, who was involved with the Civilian Construction Corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the privilege of presenting several other civilian medals, mainly to women, VADs and those who were in the Land Army. One of them, sadly, died a couple of weeks later. We had to bring the ceremony forward because we knew she was not going to last much longer. That was very important. I also had the privilege of being amongst a small group of members from both sides of the House who travelled from here to Sydney to see off the pilgrims going back to New Guinea. One of them was one of my constituents, Mr Bruce `Buster' Brown, who is a highly decorated former air force officer. He has featured a lot on radio and television programs. It was a great privilege for me to go with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the minister to see those people off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that was a great hit later in the year for everybody who has taken part in it was the presentation of certificates of appreciation. Since we advertised the availability of these certificates I think all of us have been flooded with applications and they are still coming in. Recently in my electorate there was a ceremony which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) attended. I wrote to all the applicants at that time and asked them to come. I was overwhelmed at the number of people who wanted to come. With their friends and relatives we packed out the Springwood Civic Centre. There were 800 people there and they were standing around the walls. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to present the certificates, even walking ourselves down each row. Sadly, some people turned up who had not rung to say they were coming and we had to find them seats and get their certificates made up. We had the calligrapher on hand. I have been flooded with letters and phone calls from people saying how much they appreciated that ceremony. That has been enormously important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also presented some certificates at one of my RSL clubs recently. I think there were eight on that occasion. At the end of the dinner and the presentation, five other people came up to me and said, `I wasn't going to get one of those `cos, you know, I've got my medals and everything, but they are beautiful, aren't they? I think I'll have one.' Fortunately, being prepared, I had a bunch of application forms in my handbag. I have already delivered a few to the homes of people that I know are nearing the end of their life. It has been special to them to have their families there, with a camera, when they have received a certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the RSL clubs in my electorate. They have done a marvellous job in carrying out their own functions, ceremonies and so on. They have cooperated extremely well with the committees. I would like to personally thank those committee members because they did a splendid job. The Hawkesbury committee was chaired by Ms Alannah Sledge who is a young woman and the public relations officer of Hawkesbury City Council. I would like to thank the general manager of Hawkesbury City Council, Gary McCully, for allowing us to put the funds through the council and have the distributions made from there. The other members were Mr Alan Dunstone from Windsor RSL&mdash;he organised all the school activities in the area&mdash;Mr Keith Chew, Mr John Crook, Wing Commander Grant Buggy from the RAAF base and Councillor Chris Paine from the Hawkesbury City Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Blue Mountains the committee was chaired by Mr Tony Atwood and included Mr Pat Brook from Katoomba, who organised the big VP march, Ms Olma Halpin, Ms Joyce Burrows, Councillor Joy Anderson, who was the Mayor of the Blue Mountains City Council at the time, Mary Caldbeck-Moore, who organised the VE Day ceremony, ably aided by Ms Alma King and Councillor Anderson, Ms May Howlett, who produced the `Songs of survival' cabaret which I described and which gave us all such pleasure, and Mrs Fay Wheatley, the President of the Blue Mountains Ex-servicewomen's Association. The association did a window display in Springwood for VE Day. I also thank Mrs Joy Beohm, who is a returned service person herself and a member of the Ex-servicewomen's Association, and Mrs Betty Chialvo and Ms Dorothy Tartt from Blackheath. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to join with colleagues on both sides of the chamber in applauding the Australia Remembers program. This is probably the first time that one generation of Australians has collectively thanked a prior generation for being prepared to risk everything to ensure that today we enjoy the freedom, stability and way of life that we do enjoy as a nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the electorate of Fisher we set up an Australia Remembers committee. We called for people from throughout the electorate to come to a public meeting at the Caloundra RSL and a committee was elected. It was a vigorous committee which worked very well on the Australia Remembers program. In a large and diverse electorate such as Fisher there would be many opportunities for disagreements among the various localities, but it is to the credit of this committee that the range of projects recommended for seeding funding to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) came from all parts of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the Australia Remembers Committee was Gordon Caldwell, the secretary was Dick Allchin, the treasurer was Bill Platten, and committee members were Jim Courtney, Bernie Barton, Bob Russell, Gordon Granzien and John Hodgkinson. The committee was broadly representative of the former electorate of Fisher prior to the redistribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose when the minister announced that each federal electorate would receive the sum of $20,000 we were all obviously very pleased because this seeding funding would encourage a broad range of projects from throughout the electorate. As people continue to move from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to the sun belt area of Queensland, every three years we have a redistribution and additional seats are given to Queensland because, of course, Queensland is the place to where people are moving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was regrettable that the government did not find it possible to give an extra $20,000 to the new electorate of Longman created largely from Fisher and Dickson. I believe that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) felt the same as I did on this matter. The minister said that the government had only been able to allocate $20,000 for each existing electorate as at the time of the last election. Consequently, the Fisher Australia Remembers Committee equitably allocated a proportion of funds to that area which has been lost to Longman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had 19 projects recommended for funding to the minister. It ought to be remembered that those projects were recommended for seeding funding only. The amounts which were expended on the various projects very much exceeded the seeding funding received from the government. I congratulate the minister and the government on making the $20,000 available to each federal electorate. Clearly the allocation of the $20,000 encouraged local communities to come forward with ideas&mdash;ideas which could be brought to fruition during 1995, the year when Australia remembers the end of hostilities in the Second World War in 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Remembers program was one of those occasions when, for once, we were able to concentrate on those matters that unify us. I congratulate the minister's senior adviser, Greg Rudd, and the minister's wife, Tina, who must have seen very little of him during the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people initially thought that the Australia Remembers program might have been politicised by the government. But I believe that any government in office in 1995 would have given appropriate recognition to such a significant milestone in Australia's history. In an absolutely bipartisan way, I would like to express my appreciation to the minister and to the shadow minister who worked very well with the minister during this very important year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister visited many parts of the electorate. I was very honoured when he chose to visit my own electorate of Fisher, which is not an electorate the government would expect to win at the next election. The minister himself came to Caloundra and I and also other people in the community were pleased that the minister was present on Remembrance Day to unveil the plaque officially opening the memorial walkway, which was one the many projects in the Fisher electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Like other electorates, we had a balance of bricks and mortar projects and other projects which commemorated the end of the Second World War. I have never before seen the community come together and work in the way that it has. We have also had hundreds of people who have applied for the certificate of appreciation, which was given by the parliament to those people who served Australia in war either on the battlefield or at home. Those who made a contribution to the war effort have been appropriately recognised through these Australia Remembers certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like at this point to thank the Caloundra City Council, which has given me the opportunity of presenting these Australia Remembers certificates at public citizenship ceremonies so that people who served their country were able to receive their certificates in a public forum. The mayor, Councillor Des Dwyer, and councillors of the Caloundra City Council all cooperated in facilitating this public opportunity to thank citizens of the city of Caloundra for their contribution to the war effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank the mayor, Councillor Bob King, and the councillors of the Maroochy Shire Council. Similarly, they gave opportunities at a citizenship ceremony in the shire of Maroochy to enable presentations of Australia Remembers certificates to be made, so that the community could see that these people to whom we owed so much were being publicly recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kawana Waters RSL has also permitted me to present Australia Remembers certificates at its monthly meetings over the last couple of months. We have had a large number of people at those meetings. I would like to thank the President of the Kawana Waters RSL, Mr Kevin Grayson, for the way in which he and his committee have facilitated the presentation of those certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kilcoy Shire Council held a major day of recognition remembering the end of the Second World War. An opportunity was also given to me at that event to present Australia Remembers certificates to citizens of the shire of Kilcoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about the $20,000 which each federal electorate received by way of seeding funding, but it should be recognised that a large number of unfunded projects also took place right throughout the nation. For instance, I was privileged to be present at the unveiling of Memorial Gardens at the Bokarina and Buddina state schools on the Sunshine Coast. It is a real credit not only to these schools but also to the surrounding communities and to the Kawana Waters RSL that it has been possible to create a permanent reminder for young generations coming through our schools in the future of what we owe those people who went to war and who were prepared to risk absolutely everything to ensure that today's Australians enjoy the democracy and freedom that we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also an Australia Remembers ball at the Caloundra RSL War Veterans Home. Noel Box did a wonderful job, along with the staff from the RSL War Veterans Home, in arranging that ball. There was a lady there, Mrs Roberta Campbell, who is well over 100 years of age. She received an Australia Remembers certificate from me on that occasion. I was particularly impressed with the way that Mrs Roberta Campbell was able to respond. She grabbed the microphone and she gave a speech. I think that is absolutely wonderful for a lady who is over 100 years of age. Of course, Mrs Campbell is someone who can remember a tremendous amount of Australia's history. It was wonderful to have her present on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have had an enormous cross-section of both bricks and mortar projects, and other projects in the electorate of Fisher. I have been impressed with the way that so many people have made a contribution, particularly the way our young people have been involved with the Australia Remembers projects in the electorate of Fisher. It has been one of those opportunities for all groups in the community&mdash;ex-service people, people who were not part of the ex-service community, people who were too young to go to war and our children&mdash;to make a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would like to mention the memorial walkway which has been established at Caloundra. There was seeding funding received from the Australia Remembers project for this particular walkway. The seeding funding is only a small fraction of the total amount that will be expended. The memorial walkway will stretch from Kings Beach along the headland to Shelly Beach. Stage one of the memorial walk will extend from the Centaur Memorial to the Anzac Memorial. The minister came to officially unveil the plaque declaring the memorial walkway open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have had family members serve their country are able to buy a plaque. The name of the person who served the nation, along with the details of that service, will be placed on that plaque which will then be set in the memorial walkway. That will be a permanent reminder for those who use the walkway in the future of what we, as a nation, owe those people who made such a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had an occasion where, in Maleny, the RSL put forward a very positive project. The Governor of Queensland, Her Excellency Mrs Leneen Forde AC, came along on 15 August, VP&mdash;Victory in the Pacific&mdash;Day, to open officially the newly constructed memorial area and plaques. We also have a perpetual flame there so that those people who go past the RSL in Maleny are able to recognise the debt which today's Australians owe to those who served this nation in the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was invited to launch officially the Blackbutt writers group publication, a book setting out wartime reminiscences of a number of people in the Blackbutt area. It is interesting when one goes into country areas to see just how diverse the life experiences are of those people. Some, of course, served in New Guinea or in other spheres of conflict. There was even a contribution by a gentleman who was a boy in wartime Holland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was so impressed with the way the entire Blackbutt community got behind this project and came along and supported it. What has been produced using the seeding funding from the Australia Remembers program will be there as a permanent record of those experiences and reminiscences. The Bribie Island RSL was also particularly active. It produced a book on the role played by Fort Bribie in World War II. Fort Bribie was one of those establishments on Bribie Island about which very little is known. I commend anyone interested in the war effort in that part of Australia to look at that book produced by the Bribie Island RSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a whole range of other projects. Time will preclude my mentioning each of them. We have had the supply and installation of water fountains, park benches, park tables, the publication of various books, an exhibition of wartime art and photography, and re-enactments of wartime dances. We have had RSLs assist schools with the purchase of CD-ROMs and memorial plaques. We have had the Caloundra City Council recreate a cameo of life in Caloundra during World War II. We have had honour boards restored and the restoration of other wartime memorials. We have had essay competitions. We have had many schools participating in a way that did not cost anything, in so far as the schools and the local communities were prepared to put the funds in and to create these permanent memorials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Summing up, I would like to congratulate everyone in this place. I would like to congratulate the community in Fisher, the minister and the shadow minister on what has been achieved in the Australia Remembers program. Never before has one generation of Australians been prepared collectively to thank those who have gone before and to whom we owe so much. I would also stress that it is important whenever possible that as Australians we work in a unifying way to thank those people who helped to contribute to our way of life. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Today I announce the government's broad policy direction on Australia's forests and forest industries. I am also announcing several related initiatives vital to the future of our native forests and the industries which depend upon them. Full details of these measures will be released tomorrow by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), and the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's forests are a defining feature of our landscape, a priceless element of our environment and heritage, a national resource of immeasurable proportions&mdash;and a profound national responsibility. All Australians have a stake in these forests. All of us have a responsibility to insist that they are properly managed and carefully conserved. They are a national treasure and their management must be ecologically sustainable and economically clever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our native forests are of inestimable conservation value. They are vital repositories of biological diversity&mdash;indeed, new species of plants and animals are still being discovered. They are a haven for endangered species. They are vitally important as water catchments, they influence our climate and act as carbon sinks to limit the greenhouse effect. Just as importantly they are places of unique and unrivalled beauty. They are aesthetically and spiritually important to us. They are important to our sense of belonging to this land. Our respect for and enjoyment of them is part of our communion with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national interest quite simply demands that we protect our forests. This same national interest also demands that we use the forests intelligently for the things we need and for the communities that live with them. Our forests have economic significance. They are an important renewable resource, contributing to the wealth of the nation, and providing us with essential commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians, and many Australian communities, depend on our native forests for their livelihoods. Whatever we decide are our priorities, their interests must be attended to. This perception of an irresolvable conflict between the environmental and commercial values of forests has produced deep divisions in the Australian community. The debate presents itself as a conflict between absolutes: the absolute necessity to protect these priceless parts of our environment, and the absolute necessity to protect Australia's economic interests and the wellbeing of Australian working men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conflict is easily understood. No Australians want to see these forests destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Nor do they wish to see the economic interests of Australia damaged or the livelihoods of their fellow Australians threatened. We on the government side number ourselves among these Australians. I hope people on the other side of the House can endorse these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No policy is going to satisfy everyone. Neither side of this debate can expect to get everything they want. The aim is to see that Australia is the winner, that the Australians of the next century are the winners. In the end, the essential goal is the protection of the long-term national interest. It is towards this goal that the government has steered a course. Our cause will be greatly advanced if, on both sides, the debate is conducted with the national interest in mind. We should all remember that no-one in this conflict has a monopoly on truth or virtue, or a mortgage on concern for the future of our forests. Those who presume they do and claim it exclusively will only debilitate the efforts of people of good will to find the best solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that this is a debate which will of its nature arouse great passions. But, equally, the solutions and the path to them cannot be other than rational. We will not find solutions without cool thinking and a genuine desire to find common ground and a degree of shared goodwill. If the task of devising a national forest policy which meets community expectations is made difficult by polarised opinion and emotion, it is made even more complex by the fact that, under our constitution, the states have the primary responsibility for land management, including the management of our forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many in the Australian community expect the Commonwealth to take more responsibility for Australia's forests than the Commonwealth has the ability to take. It is expected of the federal government that we develop an effective national policy, yet the federal government does not effectively have the power to do so. What powers we do have can never deliver the long-term changes we are seeking&mdash;to the reserves, to sustainable management and to the industry&mdash;without the states. The recourse to the Commonwealth government underlines the failure of interest groups to secure the appropriate undertakings from those who do manage forests in Australia and that, of course, is the state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In lieu of actual powers, the government has taken the lead in developing with the states a cooperative approach to managing and protecting our forests. This policy has depended upon the states recognising that there is a national interest to be served, and success in the long run will in large part depend upon the states continuing to recognise this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We started on this difficult journey towards a common approach to forest management with the development of the 1992 national forest policy statement, to which all state and territory governments are now signatories. This was itself no easy matter, and some parties have only more recently joined. Embodied in that statement are the shared economic, social and environmental objectives which all governments have made a commitment to achieving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the national forest policy statement, the Commonwealth and the states agreed to the ecologically sustainable management of Australia's forests. Realising that we did not know enough about our forests, the statement provided the basis for thorough, cooperative assessments of their values, leading ultimately to the concept of regional forest agreements with the states. These agreements offer the real possibility of a long-term framework for the protection and management of these important national assets. As an idea it is probably unique in the developed world. The policy provides for the development of a national forest reserve system, which would ensure the protection of high conservation value areas required to maintain biodiversity, old-growth and wilderness values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the Commonwealth through a panel of scientists, developed a set of criteria for determining which areas should become a part of this system. They include;</PARA>
<PARA>.a broad benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-European distribution of each forest type to be protected within the reserve system. </PARA>
<PARA>.retention in reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth, increasing up to 100 per cent wherever practicable for rare old growth</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">and</PARA>
<PARA>.protection of 90 per cent or more wherever practicable, or areas of high quality wilderness</PARA>
<PARA>These criteria are recognised as at the leading edge in world terms. But before we can arrive at a position from which we can negotiate regional forest agreements and, through them, a comprehensive, adequate and representative national forest reserve system, we must put in place interim protection measures for forests which might be required as components of such a reserve system. The device we are using for this is a deferred forest area, or DFA, process. The deferred forest area process has been designed to provide the appropriate degree of interim protection needed for the longer term RFAs. It is not meant to be the last word on which areas would be logged and which would be turned over to forest reserves. Rather, it is meant to provide an essential building block on the way to regional forest agreements. The decisions to be announced tomorrow, therefore, are but the first step in a longer, more rigorous process. But, for the forests, it is a giant step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For most of this year, the Commonwealth has been negotiating with New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia to identify forest areas to be protected pending further assessment in the development of regional forest agreements. In cooperation with these governments, the Commonwealth has recently concluded a very extensive consultation process in which interested individuals and groups have had their say in an open and transparent process. Through their contribution they have been able to influence the outcome and, I am pleased to say, our deferred forest areas are the better for it. At the same time, I believe that these consultations have underlined the fact that the policy approach we have chosen is undoubtedly the right one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the deferred forest areas process, we have delivered a positive and, I stress, immediate outcome for all Australians who have a stake in our forests&mdash;which is to say, albeit to varying degrees, every Australian. As a first step, the decisions we have taken this week offer sound conservation outcomes as well as predictability for our forest industry. We have taken a precautionary approach so as to ensure that future reservation options are kept open. Cabinet has agreed on the areas of state forest to be deferred. Detailed maps of these areas will be released tomorrow. Our objective has been to ensure that options for establishing the reserve system, based on criteria developed by the Commonwealth, are not foreclosed while longer term assessments are conducted. I am confident that we have achieved this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next few weeks, the Commonwealth expects to sign deferred forest agreements with the states I have mentioned. I will be writing to the premiers later today inviting them to enter these agreements. I have on a number of occasions talked about creating in Australia a forest reserve system the equal of any in the world. With the signing of these agreements, we will have taken a huge step towards this objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management of those parts of the forest estate outside the reserve system is just as important as the reserves themselves. The government is committed to ensuring that the management of these areas, some of which will be available for harvesting, is truly sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the longer term process, we will be joining with the states in a thorough review of forest management and codes of practice. Our aim is to ensure that the full range of values we attach to our forests is maintained in perpetuity. We must adopt the view that these precious assets are held in trust for the future, they are not ours to neglect or degrade. The forests industry should be a model of ecologically sustainable development. Our objective is to ensure that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual turnover of Australia's wood and paper industry based on native forests and plantations is in the order of $10 billion, or about one per cent of gross domestic product. The government believes it is imperative to have a viable wood and wood products industry. Investments of between $4 billion and $6 billion are at present under consideration. Industry and unions predict between 15,000 and 25,000 potential new jobs over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The associated wood and paper industry strategy, also to be released tomorrow, sets out the government's long-term vision for this industry. It is the government's aim to transform it&mdash;to make it both internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this transformation, we will be encouraging increased investment in value adding processes for wood and wood pulp and will give priority in issuing woodchip export licences to applicants who invest in domestic processing. We are determined to sharply improve domestic value adding of residues currently being exported as unprocessed woodchips. We will, through this industry, expand job opportunities in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will clear the way for value adding to forest residues by the release of strict environmental standards for bleached eucalypt kraft pulp mills. Through regional forest agreements to be developed with state governments, we will provide industry with increased assurance about resource supply and greater regulatory certainty. We will continue to remove duplication in environmental impact assessment processes at the federal and state levels and reduce administrative and compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through AusIndustry we will provide additional funding for enterprise development to firms in the wood and paper industries, and so promote best practice and competitive efficiency. We will provide additional assistance to small and medium firms in the wood and paper industry who are seeking to move into new markets or upgrade existing facilities. Through the Wood and Paper Industry Council, we will develop industry sector approaches to investment and improved import replacement and export performance. Underlying all of these initiatives is a fundamental commitment to sustainable job growth and opportunities for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government is committed to the long-term sustainability and prosperity of the native forest based industry, special recognition will also be given to the increasingly important role of plantations and farm forestry. These sectors represent the best sources for future growth in the wood and paper industry. Plantations already supply a significant proportion of our total wood and paper products and major value adding investment proposals are currently under consideration. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, let me turn to the vexed question of the woodchip export licences. Applications for woodchip exports for this year were about nine million tonnes. However, as indicated last year the government wants to reduce the amount of wood exported in this unprocessed form. The government has therefore decided on a much lower volume for this year, which will be 5.25 million tonnes. This amount is a fair and consistent down payment on that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Licences will be issued for 80 per cent of that volume. The remaining 20 per cent will only be available in regions where there has been significant progress towards regional Forest agreements with state governments. Details of this year's ceiling will be announced tomorrow by the Minister for Resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made a commitment to phasing out woodchips exports by the year 2000 from areas not covered by regional forest agreements. We remain committed to diverting these exports into further domestic value adding. The industry is on notice that, unless we get the progress and the agreements, woodchip exports will be phased out. Those on the extremes of the debate&mdash;in the timber industry and among their more uncompromising opponents&mdash;should understand that the government will not waver from this course or these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No Australian government has ever made such a conscientious attempt to resolve this huge and vexed issue. Most governments would run a million miles from it. We have been at pains to strike the right balance; to find the means by which environmental and economic necessities can be reconciled in the national interest; the means by which a profitable industry and prosperous communities can be reconciled with our responsibility to preserve a unique and magnificent part of our natural heritage for our children and the Australians of the 21st century and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes it can be done. This statement demonstrates that driving an intelligent course can reap substantial and permanent benefits for both sides of the debate and for the nation&mdash;more substantial and more permanent than any we might derive from pursuing one direction to the exclusion of the interests of the others. The moral comfort of extreme and certain positions may be warming to those who hold them, but they do not confront the real moral challenge: to deliver real, worthwhile, lasting and democratic solutions&mdash;ones that everyone can respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons this has been a complicated issue for the government is that the government, and the Prime Minister in particular, set out from the very beginning to politicise this issue, to create expectations within the environmental community which could never be realised, to pander in one month to one side of the debate and in the next month to pander to another side of the debate. The Prime Minister now appeals in statesman like mode to both sides to be reasonable, to be understanding, to be full of warm moral feelings and warm moral convictions. Yet he himself incited a rabid sectional approach to this issue. It is therefore certainly not surprising that the issue has proved so difficult to resolve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The twin goals of a world-class forest reserve system and a sustainable forest industry are shared by all fair-minded Australians. However, the forestry issue is a classical example of a political dilemma where finding the right solution will inevitably entail some give and take on both sides. It is not an issue that will be resolved in the long term by imposing politically motivated solutions on either the industry or the environmental movement. As over two decades of experience have amply shown, it is not an issue where the national interest will ever be served by relying on conflict and division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No Australian should be under any illusion about the importance of getting the forest debate right. Forests are a vital part of our heritage, and we do have a responsibility to future generations of Australians to preserve and sustain our unique and, by world standards, relatively unspoilt natural environment in as pristine a condition as possible. Just as importantly, we should not forget that forest products are one of our most important and widely used primary resources and that the forest industry is, and under a coalition government will continue to be, the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition fully recognises that, as a nation, we have a duty to preserve our high conservation old growth forests and wilderness areas. Equally, we cannot as a nation undermine the confidence of an industry which is worth nearly $6 billion a year, which employs over 70,000 Australians, mainly in rural and regional areas, and which has enormous potential for sustainable growth in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Prime Minister, your statement today is very strong on rhetorical flourishes but is desperately short on the details that both conservationists and the industry want. For example, we still do not know when or if the national forest policy statement&mdash;which this government promised would be implemented this year&mdash;will actually be implemented. The reality is that after this statement the industry still does not know whether it will have a long-term security of supply. The conservation movement does not know the shape of the final reserve system. We do not even know the extent to which the government will fund the management of the reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this statement today is designed to do&mdash;and it is very clear&mdash;is put off the difficult decisions until after the election. It will not be surprising, Prime Minister, if over the next few days you do not find that your answer to this problem is believed with unanimity on both sides. Both sides of this debate have seen the political stunts of this government before. Both sides of this debate have seen their inordinately raised expectations dashed by what the government has actually done. If they are environmentalists, they are sick therefore of their genuine environmental concerns being used again and again for cheap political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, you have been in power for 13 years and you made great play today, Prime Minister, on woodchips. The reality is that your government is the champion woodchip exporter in Australia's history. No government has exported more woodchips than the Hawke and Keating governments. Why has this happened? It has happened because your policy confusion over 13 years has made it increasingly harder for industry to have the confidence to develop value-added processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great sympathy with all those Australians, conservationists and timber industry workers alike, who fervently believe that domestic processing is far preferable to woodchip export. In comparable countries around the world there have been massive investments in downstream timber processing infrastructure during the last 10 years. But the total inability of both the Keating and Hawke Labor governments to focus on what are the real issues in the forestry industry has meant that Australia has missed out on most of that wave of investment&mdash;missed out to such an extent that one of the world's potentially richest forest product producing nations now runs a deficit in that area of $2 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might ask: where is the massive expansion of our softwood plantation industry? We might ask: why are we not establishing new state-of-the-art environmental acceptable pulp and paper mills? It is not surprising, if we look at the government's record with the national forest policy statement that was signed by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian government in December 1992. It was meant to solve the problems we are facing today. It was the great solution that would satisfy all parties. It was meant to deliver a high quality reserve system and a sustainable timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What, in reality, happened? You failed, Prime Minister and your ministers, to implement the national forest policy statement. How many times has the Labor government over the last 13 years announced `peace in our time' in our forest industry? In 1988, in 1992 and now, apparently, in 1995 again another piece of paper is waved at us by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement today, one of the belated solutions offered by the Prime Minister was to encourage more plantations. Once again, let us look at the government's record in this area&mdash;and it is not very impressive. The rate of softwood plantation establishment in Australia has reached a 30-year low at a time when plantations in neighbouring countries like New Zealand are expanding on a massive scale. You do not have to be a genius to recognise that an expanded plantation and farm forestry industry can deliver major environmental gains while at the same time provide a viable additional timber supply source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year it is estimated that Australia's rate of softwood plantation establishment will be between three and 10 times that of a country the size of New Zealand. Clearly the timber industry, the major corporations and investment companies do not have the necessary confidence in this government's policies to be prepared to plant the trees that all Australians want and you, now belatedly, think are essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course plantations and farm forestry are essential. They have been essential for the past 13 years. They are a resource with an extremely long lead time. The tragic reality is that future generations of Australians will now have to carry the cost of this government's lack of foresight and concerted action in this vital policy area. Yet today the Prime Minister has been brazen enough to come to this parliament and tell the people of Australia that this tired and crumbling government has discovered the answer to the long-term sustainability of the timber industry. The reality is that you are one of the last people in Australia to understand the importance of plantations for the future of our forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, with its huge potential in wood products, has a massive and increasing forest products deficit. In the last year this deficit amounted to $2 billion. As a nation we exported about $1 billion of, in the main, relatively unprocessed wood, while importing $3 billion worth of mainly high value-added timber, pulp and paper products. Undoubtedly, some of those imports came from unsustainably managed forests in countries with neither the technical expertise nor the economic resource that we enjoy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, no-one would argue with the quite genuine attempts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to assist in the preservation of the pristine wilderness areas in places like the Morovo Lagoon in the Solomon Islands. But surely Australians have a right to ask where this government's priorities lie when, at the same time that it is preaching to our Pacific neighbours, it is sitting on its hands for two whole years hoping that the national forest policy statement will implement itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that as a fundamental priority we must protect our high conservation value native forests. This objective will best be achieved by the expedited implementation of the national forest policy statement. The two principal aims of that statement are, first, the creation of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system which will protect the diversity of native forests as well as our high quality, old growth forests and wilderness areas; and, second, to ensure Australia has a significant, sustainable, native forest-based timber industry. It is indisputable that we must have a world-class forest reserve system, and the coalition is committed in government to establishing a reserve system which is at least the equal of, and, I believe&mdash;with our much greater emphasis on revegetation, plantations and the importance of value adding&mdash;considerably better than that proposed by Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are all aware, the government's criteria for a world-class reserve system includes a broad benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-European settlement distribution of each forest type. Mr Speaker, I say on behalf of the coalition that we support this as a worthwhile objective. There is a need to extend the forest reserve system to incorporate forest types that are not adequately represented at present. We acknowledge that for many forest types the government's target can be achieved relatively easily. In fact, in some cases it has already been exceeded or is likely to be exceeded with little or no disruption to the industry or to local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in other areas, as members of the government know only too well&mdash;particularly in northern New South Wales and in parts of Queensland&mdash;the 15 per cent will be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve, as the government well knows and as the Prime Minister should have had the courage to acknowledge today. The Prime Minister calls for understanding on both sides of the debate. The prerequisite of understanding on both sides of the debate is a bit of candour and frankness from the Prime Minister himself. But, by pretending once again that he can be all things to all men, he squanders the opportunity of getting that very understanding from both sides of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians would expect that, in those areas where the biodiversity criteria are not readily achievable, full and proper consideration must be given to the potential impact on people's lives, as well as the economic impact on the wider community. Prime Minister, very interestingly, in your statement today you said that the government wants to reduce the amount of unprocessed wood exports and that you had therefore decided on `a much lower volume for this year which will be 5.25 million tonnes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised by the industry today that, in 1995, a similar volume of woodchip exports&mdash;that is, 5.25 million tonnes&mdash;will be shipped out of Australia. If this is the case, then the direct inference in your speech that the 5.25 million tonnes export quota in 1996 will mean much lower woodchip export volumes in the coming year was clearly misleading. You have told far too many porkies in this area on the forest to be believed by either the industry or the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public, Mr Speaker, have also learned the lesson of the l-a-w tax cuts. The last thing they want is an l-o-g forest fudge which cannot and will not be delivered after the election. One of the significant elements of this statement is that so much is predicated on negotiations and events and discussions that are not scheduled to be completed before the election is likely to be held in the first half of next year. The forest industry, like all industries, must have the confidence that governments will develop a clear and coherent policy, and stick with it in the long run. That is why implementing the national forest policy statement is so vitally important, not only to the conservation movement but also to the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is a firm believer that, if the industry is given the confidence that it needs, it will react accordingly. There is the prospect of hundreds of millions&mdash;if not billions&mdash;of dollars being invested in new plant and equipment by the forest industry in the areas of value adding and other improvements. In New South Wales alone, I understand that the industry would invest up to $200 million over the next 18 months to two years if it were given the necessary incentive and confidence to do so. It is estimated that such investment would provide up to 1,000 new jobs, mainly in regional and rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, West Farmers-Bunnings are contemplating developing a state-of-the-art pulp mill, the first stage alone which would entail an investment approaching half a billion dollars. The Taiwan pulp and paper industry is investigating the feasibility of developing a world-scale pulp mill in the north of Tasmania which could be worth well over $1 billion. In Victoria, I am also aware of proposals for investment in medium density fibreboard mills with a value of more than $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not shy away from its responsibility to preserve Australia's high conservation value native forests. We are equally committed, however, to ensuring that major investments in a sustainable forest industry such as these are not put at risk. In the lead-up to the next election, the coalition will sit down with all stakeholders and carefully assess the impact of the government's latest in a very long line of forest statements. We will closely examine the proposed wood and paper restructuring package and consult widely with the industry and other affected parties in assessing the extent to which it does or does not meet the challenges that lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that such a package is required is, in itself, very clear evidence of this government's failure over many years to put sound policies in place which would have avoided much of the dislocation that its policy vacuum has now brought about. Nevertheless, the coalition does acknowledge that, as a result of the government's past errors, such a restructuring package is now necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that the fact that Labor has politicised and polarised the forest debate in this country for so long will make it significantly more difficult for any future government to achieve the dual objectives of a world-class reserve system and a confident and sustainable forest industry. However, the coalition is totally committed to delivering on these crucial objectives in a way that ensures that the forest industry achieves its full potential and the environmental values of our native forests are protected for the enjoyment of this and future generations of Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really should not have any sympathy for them, but I can just understand how desperate many of them feel. They have spent the last nine months watching the major battlefield of politics in Australia being not over the middle ground of Australian politics, being not over a constituency that normally belongs to the Liberal Party and the National Party, but over the allegiance of people who have habitually voted Labor all their lives. They feel so let down, they feel so betrayed, and they feel so angry. </PARA>

They are determined to vote this government out. They are determined to tell an arrogant out-of-touch Prime Minister that he no longer represents their best interests. They are determined to wreak their vengeance on the Australian Labor Party at the next election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes or no, Harry? Hey Graeme, will you say that? Mr Speaker, can I tell you the reason why these hundreds of thousands of former true believers of the Labor Party are aching for the opportunity to vote against this government? There is one very, very simple reason. The leader of the government, the Prime Minister, has always paraded himself as a bit of a specialist. In a sense these people recognise that. They see Paul Keating very much as the foreign debt specialist. They see him as the high interest rate specialist. They see him as the high unemployment specialist. But most importantly of all, Mr Speaker, the people of Australia&mdash;not only those hundreds of thousands who are going to walk away from him whenever the election is held, but also millions of other Australians&mdash;see Paul Keating as the divided society specialist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst legacy of this man and of this government when it is voted out of office will be the extent to which it has divided the Australian community; the extent to which it has put one Australian against another; the extent to which it has presided over the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor; and the extent to which it has sought to play pressure group politics to the detriment of the interests of the mainstream Australian community. This man will wear the mark of dividing Australian society; of being a leader who has wounded and wrecked rather than healed and united; and of being a leader who has seen partisan political advantage in setting one group against another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there is a demonstration of the futility of that approach, and if ever there has been a demonstration of the failure of that approach, it has been in relation to the issue about which the Prime Minister and I have just spoken&mdash;the woodchip debate. The reason that you are in a mess on forests, Prime Minister, is that you have politicised the issue to the detriment of the national interest. That is why you are in an absolute mess on this particular subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look back over the last eight or nine months, I am reminded of the infinite variety of the attacks that have been mounted against me and the opposition by the Prime Minister. When I was first elected on 30 January, the Prime Minister and all of his colleagues embarked upon this tremendous campaign to talk about the past, to talk about the 1950s, to try to create the impression that the government stands for the future and the coalition stands for the past. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Beazley" NAMEID="PE4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you say it is true. I am glad you do, because we had a marvellous opportunity a few weeks ago to see who is for the past and who is for the future in the dispute about CRA. As I listened to that dispute, I heard a violence of language and a violence of words that I thought had disappeared from the Australian political and industrial scene. I heard people talk about drawing a line in the sand. I heard people talk about inflicting pain. I heard people talk about chasing companies down rabbit holes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say to you, Mr Speaker, that there was a lot of pain inflicted. There was about $200 million of pain inflicted on the Australian economy. There was enormous pain inflicted on a leather exporter I know in Western Australia who, after struggling for years to win an export order in South-East Asia, suffered the ignominy of seeing his export order tied up on a wharf that had been rendered useless by the MUA strike. The result after all of his years of work was that he lost the order to a competitor in another part of South-East Asia. That is the kind of pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I listened to the language of people like Jennie George, to the language of people like Bill Kelty and to the language of people like Doug Cameron and Tim Pallas, I thought I was hearing debates from years ago. It was this old-fashioned, class driven language of the trade union leadership of Australia. That brings us inexorably to the Prime Minister. Where was he? He was in Japan. There he was in Japan stranded in his irrelevance so far as this particular dispute is concerned&mdash;absolutely stranded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really did put me in mind of the opening over of a test match where you have the bowling being opened by Bob Hawke and Jennie George, you have Bill Kelty keeping wickets and you have Tim Pallas and Doug Cameron in first and second slip. Where is the Prime Minister? He has been consigned to fine leg. Don't you feel lonely, Laurie, you were left to bring out the drinks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the interesting things in life is to study people's self-descriptions. I always find, as I am sure many other members of the House find, self-portraits and self-descriptions to be very revealing. They are revealing not only of delusions but also of vulnerabilities. The Prime Minister has his own sort of self-description. I think I have got it right when the Prime Minister says, `You know, they may think I'm a bit arrogant. They may think I am a smidgin out of touch. But gee, you know, despite all of that, I do get the mail through.' This is the self-portrait he paints of himself: `I may be arrogant'&mdash;grant that&mdash;`but, gee, I get things done and I get the mail through.' I think that reveals both vulnerability and delusion, because the great delusion that Prime Minister has is that in some way he does get the mail through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People often say to me, `I want to vote against the Prime Minister because he is arrogant.' I say to them, `Don't vote against the Prime Minister because he is arrogant. Vote against the Prime Minister because he has been a failure.' The real reason why this man should be voted out of office, the real reason why his government should be voted out of office, is that this government has been a failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on the other side may use their noise, they may use their numbers, they may use anything they like in order to interject and to cry down what I am saying, but the reality is unquestionably that it is not the arrogance of the Prime Minister that deserves censure&mdash;although there is a lot of that; the reason he deserves censure is that he has been a failure as the Prime Minister of this country. That is the reason he deserves censure. You ask why I put that proposition, Mr Speaker. Let us look at unemployment. If ever there were a social concern that you would think a Labor government would want to have the most pristine credentials on at all, it would be unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aren't you ashamed that, after 13 years, unemployment is now going up again towards nine per cent? Aren't you ashamed that youth unemployment now sits at 30 per cent? Aren't you ashamed that despite all the talk about turning corners, bringing home the bacon and that this is the one that is going to deliver it all, you still have a situation where the unemployment rate in this country is starting to rise again and we still have almost one in three Australian young people who want to get a job but cannot? Is that the sort of legacy that you want to take to the true believers in an electorate like Hughes? Is that the sort of legacy that you want to take to Labor voters in other parts of the Australian community? Of course it is not. Then, of course, we get to the Prime Minister's piece de resistance; that is, the current account deficit. Of all of the extravagant claims that the Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He says that here I go. I will be going a lot more on the current account deficit between now and the election. Do you think you have heard the last about the current account deficit? Wasn't it in 1986 that the Prime Minister said that if we had a worse current account deficit&mdash;it is now much worse than it was then&mdash;we would be headed towards becoming a banana republic? We now have the current account deficit that is the worst in the OECD. It is worse even than Mexico. We have a foreign debt that has risen from $23 billion in 1983 to $180 billion today. Australia has amongst the highest real interest rates in the world. Inflation is now at 5.1 per cent, which is one of the highest in the OECD.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On economic growth, very interestingly the Business Council has produced an analysis of the Australian economy which has recorded&mdash;this has come out only today&mdash;`the lowest average growth rate for a five-year period since at least 1960'. So you have to go back 35 years to find an average growth rate over a period of five years which is lower than the growth rate of the last five years. Also significantly, that same report demonstrated that, in terms of national income per capita, Australia has fallen from 10th in 1983 to 22nd in 1995 in the international rankings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government and the Prime Minister want to take that kind of economic record to the Australian people, if they want to campaign on that, if they think that is as good as it's going to get, if they believe that nobody has any reason to complain or object about that, I could say, and all of my colleagues on this side of the House could simply say, `Oh, that we could be so lucky' that people could be so deluded about their own performance and so out of touch with what Australian people think of them at the present time that they could believe that that is the kind of thing that is going to secure them election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason, apart from the economic failure of the Prime Minister, that I believe the Prime Minister deserves to be censured by this House is his failure to uphold appropriate ministerial standards&mdash;his absolute failure to sack Carmen Lawrence for having deceitfully misled the Australian people.

What we are going to do as we march out of this place is shut down Stateships.' The odd National Party minister raised his hand and asked, `How are we going to keep the old constituents supplied up north?' The answer was, `Oh, we hadn't thought of that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, interestingly enough, who has been left out of the loop on a number of key occasions during the course of these matters? None other than the Deputy Prime Minister. I mean, the Deputy Prime Minister was not told. It is now on the public record that he was not even consulted&mdash;notwithstanding he is a Western Australian&mdash;in relation to stripping the member for Kalgoorlie of his preselection. The Deputy Prime Minister was way out of the loop on that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister was way out of the loop on another decision and that was&mdash;you might remember&mdash;bringing Don Russell back from Washington to Canberra. There he was caught down at the National Press Club saying, `I know nothing about this. I'm out of the loop yet again.' It is a government which, after 13 years of hard labour, has now got a record of complacency, of arrogance and of division. It is a government which should now be rejected by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a government which has created that record net foreign debt of $23 billion. That was what was on the Australian Bankcard when Keating first got the keys of the Treasury and when John Howard departed the Treasury&mdash;a net foreign debt of $23 billion.

Back there in the early 1990s we repeatedly warned the government&mdash;we put the national interest first&mdash;that we were being driven into recession. What did we get from the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister? This is the recession we had to have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, occasionally you listen to Brisbane radio, I know, particularly in busy budget weeks. It was two days after the budget that the Prime Minister went on Brisbane radio. In speaking of small business he said, `This is as good as it gets. It will never get any better.' The heartache that that created for many of the small business operators listening on that occasion, and the ripple that put right across the nation, was a legitimate reaction of total anger at a Prime Minister so out of touch that he had no idea of the real situation at the coalface. </PARA>

He will dish out statistics and figures of here in Canberra, quoting ABS, ABARE and the like. But I have got to say that there is now a slippage, a gap, and a lead time with regard to the official statistics. I do not suggest that within their parameters they are not correct, as far as they go, but you cannot just rely on those without making a fundamental assessment of how things are so different in the standard of living and job opportunities of the 47 per cent of youth unemployed in Grafton, Lismore, Murwillumbah and Coffs Harbour, versus youth unemployment right here in Canberra. This is also relevant to the small business closures and shopfront closures in Bourke, Balranald, Bedourie, Boulia and beyond and, indeed, in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne versus what the situation might be here in Canberra.

I have to say that we have been told and promised that the government has made great strides. The member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has spelt out just how disastrous and high cost that is in relation to the waterfront. On the matter of aviation safety&mdash;just a little item&mdash;the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) went a whole year without visiting the then CAA headquarters.

That plane crashed into the sea with a huge loss of life. The Seaview inquiry had terms of reference issued by the Minister for Transport on behalf of the government. That inquiry has taken thousands of hours and has heard many witnesses, and it is about to deliver a final report. It is denied the right to give a determination of reason with regard to that air crash because the minister wants to cover up. It is a disgrace that he has truncated those terms of reference to prevent a full and comprehensive response on that aspect of aviation safety. It is a track record which builds on the Mascot saga, the disgraceful transition we have had to the third runway and all the Leader of the Opposition has correctly pointed out in that regard. </PARA>

Above all, it has failed with regard to the accountability of senior ministers on the front bench here in the House of Representatives.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, was Jim McGinty motivated by an act of vengeance? He supported everything that I said prior to the Royal Commission in the Royal Commission, and so did several other Ministers who were present at that Cabinet meeting on 2 November. So, I mean, if they're going to start saying&mdash;if the Prime Minister is saying that that was the motivation, well then he's going to have to examine the motives of a lot of people, and I would say that that would just totally discredit his statements in the House, and I just find it amazing that he should say it. I was motivated by one thing and one thing only, and that was to protect somebody who was telling the truth from the malicious and vicious statements that were being put around.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a close friend of Brian Burke and I had to go to the Royal Commission into WA Inc. I was never asked to lie for him and I would never lie for anybody. That doesn't change the fact I am a close friend of Brian Burke. I've always considered myself a friend of Carmen, too, and I am not motivated by vengeance, I'm motivated by the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>History records that Pam Beggs gave evidence that Carmen Lawrence's version of the situation with regard to the Easton petition was wrong, was false, was misleading and seven other former Labor ministers backed up that view. We know now that the Prime Minister knew before the royal commission was set up that that was so. That is why the Prime Minister deserves the censure of the House this day for failing to stand up for cabinet standards and sack the minister, Carmen Lawrence, at the outset with regard to her disgraceful conduct. That is why this House should carry this censure motion today. This Prime Minister has had his turn. He has had time. It is time for a change. It is time to make a difference and get this country back on the rails&mdash;the sooner the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this debate is supposed to be to be a preview of the election campaign we are a shoe-in, because the opposition has not laid a glove on us. This has been the most appalling effort by the opposition to censure a government at the end of the parliamentary period. To say that they are making any headway in this debate would be a travesty of any fair judgment of what has been occurring in the last hour and a half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have been seeing in the course of this debate is how totally bereft the opposition is of any policy and also how totally bereft it is even of making legitimate and fundamental criticisms. They simply have not got the magnitude or the fortitude or the intelligence&mdash;whatever&mdash;to produce substantive criticism. To take a motion on the basis of economic failure is itself evidence of stupidity because there is no way that they can show that this government has been an economic failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you possibly argue that a government that has done far better than its predecessor government is an economic failure? How can you possibly argue that a government that has been doing much better than most other comparable countries in the Western world is an economic failure? How can you rationally argue such a point? You obviously cannot. It is just rhetoric and nonsense. It is just assertion. There is not a scrap, an element, of substance behind that kind of allegation. Any fair-minded judge would say that was the case. When I go to international conferences people in my position in other countries say to me how envious they are of our performance, of the fact that we have such strong growth with low inflation and strong employment growth. They wish it was occurring in their countries. If you look at the records, the figures, it is all there for you. You can see that this government has done far better in the period we have been in office than most other countries in any period you like to go back to. Certainly it has done far better than its predecessor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bear in mind the facts I gave to the House the other day. If the growth rate of the previous government had continued, that is the growth rate in the time that the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, 5 1/4 years, from that period till now we would have had over $50 billion less of GDP than we have. That is because we have had much higher growth rates than the John Howard treasurership could produce. We have had 3.7 per cent per annum against his lousy 2.2. We have a much bigger economy. The size of Western Australia and more has been produced by the difference between our growth rates. And you say that is economic failure, particularly when it has been associated with three times the rate of growth of employment, producing an additional 1.3 million jobs over what we would have had had the previous government's employment trend continued? Without that 1.3 million jobs what would the unemployment rate be today? It would be 23 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because this government has produced enormously strong job growth that, despite the fact there has been an increase in the participation rate, we have an unemployment rate a bit over eight per cent. Without that increase in the participation rate, it would be less than four per cent. We are proud of the 2.3 per cent job growth and the two million jobs. Approximately 1.3 million more jobs have resulted from our performance than from the performance of the previous government, so we are proud of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also proud of the fact that that growth has been associated with very low inflation, which is about half the rate of the previous government. If we had continued with their inflation rate, which was just on 10 per cent in the period that John Howard was Treasurer for those 5 1/4 dreadful years, we would have price levels today 70 per cent higher than they now are. That is an indication of the enormity of the difference between the inflation performance of this government and the inflation performance of the government it replaced. It is an infinitely better inflation performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard presided over an enormously rapid growth in foreign debt. His foreign debt growth rate was 35 per cent per annum. If the growth rate of foreign debt had continued like that, we would have foreign debt today at 186 per cent of GDP instead of just under 40 per cent. Yet they say, `Look at this terrible growth in foreign debt.' He presided over a rate of debt far greater than this government's debt. If his performance had continued, this nation would have been a total economic shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to the credit of this government that those economic trends have not continued and that we have had far better economic performance. The nation can therefore look proudly to the rest of the world and say that, although it is not a perfect economy and a perfect world and there are always things that one can do better, nevertheless by the standards of the past it is certainly much better, particularly when you take account of the enormous restructuring that the previous government never had the guts to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deregulation and micro-economic reform have given us great competitiveness and growth in the manufacturing industry. They have also given us a much more diversified array of exports and a capacity to compete with the rest of the world, to relate to our Asian region economically and politically and to get APEC off the ground. They have enabled us to produce what will eventually be the largest free trade grouping in the world. These are just enormous substantive economic performances. To suggest that that is economic failure just defies any sense of credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look more closely at the last few years. We have had growth over the last 17 quarters, which is a record performance. There has never been a time since statistics for quarterly national accounts have been produced in this country when we have had 17 quarters of continuous economic growth. Is that economic failure? How can that possibly be economic failure? There has been 17 per cent growth in 17 quarters. There has been one per cent growth per quarter and four per cent growth per annum, which is a terrific growth rate by the standards of most Western countries and a growth rate almost twice what Mr Howard was able to produce when he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That good growth has been associated with low inflation. The underlying rate has been no higher than 2 1/2 per cent for almost all that time. The national accounts came out yesterday. The private consumption deflator, which is often looked at as a guide to inflation, was 2.8 per cent after 17 quarters of strong growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a great structural change on inflation. We have broken away from the John Howard legacy of double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. We do not have anything remotely resembling that kind of disastrous outcome any more. We have an economy that can grow and produce good jobs with low inflation quarter after quarter and year after year. There is every reason to believe that it can go on doing that. If you do not believe me, believe the private sector forecasters. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine has a table at the back which shows the economic performance, as assessed by private sector forecasters, of 15 major developed countries. It says that in 1995 Australia's growth is expected to be the third highest of all those 15 countries. In 1996, next year, it is expected to be the highest of any of those 15 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are not looking at some doom and gloom future. We are not looking at an economy that is sagging. We are not looking at an economy that is not able to grow in the future. It is expected by these private sector forecasters, not the government forecasters, that in 1996 Australia will have the highest growth in the Western world. That is what the private sector forecasters say, yet we have a ridiculous notion about economic failure. It just defies any sense of logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This opposition has been desperate for economic failure. It has been praying every week since we have been in office that the country would experience economic failure. Every time there are good numbers they feel terribly remorseful and say, `We have to deal with some more good numbers.' So they find some element to complain about and forecast that it will not last. Year after year they have been forecasting that our growth would not last, and it is still going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember, before the last election we had both John Hewson and John Howard going around the country saying the country was facing a depression. What have we had since the last election? We have had growth in employment of 620,000. Is that a depression? Is it a recession? Is it anything but a good economic outcome? We have had very strong growth over all that period. So the doom and gloom merchants from the other side have been shown to be totally without credibility with all those failed forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all wishful thinking. They just want to see economic failure because they think then they will have a chance of sliding under the wire. They think they will get into office if there is some basis upon which the people can vote against the government, but the people of Australia cannot vote against the government on the basis of economic failure because there has been none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen also a complete failure on the part of members of the opposition to even face up to the facts in areas where they think they have a winner, such as youth unemployment. When they talk about youth unemployment they say that 29 out of every 100 young Australians who want to get a job cannot get one. They do not say that the number of young unemployed today is far less than it was when Mr Howard was Treasurer. When he went out of office, the actual number of young people looking for full-time work and unemployed was 158,000 and today it is 95,000. That is about 60,000 fewer in actual numbers than when Mr Howard was Treasurer. That just shows the incredible capacity of the opposition to distort the reality. Those opposite have a youth unemployment truck rolling around Canberra, which portrays this lie to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition said today that Australia had the lowest average growth rate over a five-year period since the 1960s according to the Business Council. I have not seen the Business Council article, but I can say that over the last 4 1/4 years&mdash;that is, 17 quarters&mdash;we have had growth of 17 per cent. In Mr Howard's 5 1/4 years as Treasurer, the economy grew by less than 12 per cent. We will match our 4 1/4 years against his 5 1/4 years any time. Ours is a far better performance in terms of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has totally failed to articulate a coherent economic policy.

It is absurd that the members of the opposition have been saying they want tighter fiscal policy whilst all the time voting against it, whilst trying to block our measures in the Senate by voting against $11 1/2 billion worth of fiscal tightening. With the support of the minor parties they have effectively blocked $3 1/2 billion, whilst at the same time going around the country saying we need tighter fiscal policy. How can you regard any such organisation as having any substance when what it does has no relationship to what it actually says?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shambles of an opposition. How could anyone possibly think this group of people could act effectively in government?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are totally incapable of articulating what their own policy is. The Leader of the Opposition said in the headland speech that we needed to have greater public savings&mdash;of course, that means net public savings&mdash;but now he is denying that that is what he really said. The headland speech was supposed to be the great economic policy, the answer to the current account problem. If anyone asks him about policy he says, `Go and see my headland speech.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> carries an interesting article which gives the lie to some of what we have just heard and justifies the very concerns which underline our putting forward this censure motion today, now amended of course by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seeking a way around it. The article says some interesting things, although I cannot help noticing as a precursor that there is a picture in here of the Prime Minister. It says underneath: `Watched by an admirer.' The admirer is Keating himself in a poster headed `Paul Keating'. The article reads in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underlying Mr Keating's problems is a resurgence of some old economic demons. Having got out of a recession and into a period of low inflation before most of the rich world, Australia is now seeing prices rise again. Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of 5.1 per cent&mdash;the highest for five years. Underlying inflation has hit 3.1 per cent, breaking the target of two to three per cent set by the Central Bank. The latest figures also show unemployment starting to rise again to 8.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent report from the Bureau of Industry Economics, a government body, has also undermined the government's claim that 12 years of deregulation and labour market reform have transformed Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We have just heard all of that being re-run in this place. They say, `We've got it right,' and I will come to an example of that in a moment. They also say, `We've got it all fixed up. Under our industrial relations policies we are doing dramatically better.' Yesterday it was better than some other country, I think it was New Zealand, but usually it is better than we have done historically. That is always done deliberately. We are coming off a pretty low base but, more importantly, the government ignores the far more important, the far more significant, criteria or comparison, if you like: how we are doing vis-a-vis our competitors abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a trading nation. We have to be efficient. It is not our past performance that we have to match or better; it is the performance of those who compete against us. The Prime Minister talks endlessly about our role in this largest ever free trade negotiation or scenario&mdash;that he personally of course has masterminded and is putting into place&mdash;which will ensure success. Yet the reality is that one of the greatest obstacles to our succeeding will be our domestic competitiveness. If you cannot compete at home, what hope do you have of competing abroad? The articles continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau of Industry Economics, a government body, has undermined the government's claim that 12 years of deregulation and labour market reform have transformed Australia. The report compared Australian energy, transport and related industries with those of foreign competitors. It found that Australia approached the best practice in only two.</PARA>
<PARA>That is right, only two: road freight and coal handling at ports. Coal handling at ports had nothing to do with your mob, neither did road freight. In fact, you have done your best to cripple that sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to aviation and the waterfront. The report goes on to say that waterfront container handling has actually become less efficient while the rest of the world has moved ahead. Australia's docks are among the slowest to move containers, which often hang around for more than 40 hours before being shifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard just the other day from an export company exporting agricultural products of high value added. This company has absolutely given up because it is so sick to death of container loads of valuable perishable agricultural product being left lying around when it is supposed to promptly get out to Asian destinations, mainly Japan. It does not get there. Product is left lying around in the heat to the point where it becomes unsaleable. This company has given up, when in reality it has enough product to send to Asia a container load a day, 365 days a year. It has the capacity to earn enormous foreign exchange for a country in desperate need of just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another industry that is hot on the agenda today; that is, the forest industry. Forestry is an area in which you have a classic example of failure on the part of the government, which now accuses us of being unable to hold a line, communicate a line and then stick with it. The government has been utterly appalling on this issue. There is no excuse whatsoever for its incapacity in recent years to do anything other than pander to whatever opportunism might best present itself as most useful at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forestry is a vital industry&mdash;that was actually acknowledged in here today&mdash;yet how often have we heard the government fail to openly and honestly explain the fact that, in this particular case, Australians are amongst the most fortunate people in the world. We can have our cake and eat it too. We can have a magnificent conservation reserve system, equal to or better than any other in the world, and at the same time have a sustainable, ecologically sound timber industry employing people, contributing to our economic wellbeing and offering a great deal of job opportunities for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That message has never got across. Why? Because this is the government that believes in political opportunism. It believes in telling whoever it thinks it might need, in terms of votes at the next election, whatever it is they want to hear so that they can be offered the comfort necessary to get over the line. It never lasts, of course. The government never delivers. Consequently, nobody is ever happy. The government has ended up in an appalling mess, which it now is belatedly trying to address with what I think was its seventh forestry statement, as a precursor to the detail which we will supposedly see tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the result of this policy inertia? What has it actually done? What has it achieved for this country? This year we will import something like $3 billion in other people's forest and paper products. We will export less than $1 billion. That is a deficit of about $2 billion and it is growing rapidly. It is an appalling outcome. Those who often sound so self-righteous on this might stop and consider where that imported paper and timber product comes from and might stop and think about Australia's international obligation to ensure that it is not just us who are managing our forests properly but that other people are as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason we have got this massive deficit in a country like ours&mdash;a country with a small population and a lot of agricultural land on which we could be growing plantation timber and value adding and so forth&mdash;is that we export low value woodchips. We export them for a couple of hundred dollars a tonne and bring them back in for $1,800 or $1,900 a tonne as paper. What absolute absurdity! What have you done about it? You have sat on your hands. You accuse us of failing to deliver a policy line and then stick to it. Where have you been on this? Your record is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frightening thing, of course, is that the projections show quite clearly that unless we do something about this the situation will get much worse. Why will it get much worse? Because no-one is going to invest. If we can believe the financial experts of this country, there are a couple of billion dollars on hold in investment in value adding of Australian timber product in this country because nobody is brave enough in the current climate to go ahead and make it all happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens if that investment goes somewhere else? What happens if it is not made here? What happens if we do not secure those opportunities for this country? Quite obviously, our deficit will continue to grow and the number of people we have employed in forestry&mdash;there are 70,000 today&mdash;will continue to shrink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, we actually do something about this issue&mdash;even belatedly; even now&mdash;the opportunities are enormously exciting. A recent report showed that with the right opportunities, including more hardwood plantations, environmentally friendly pulp mills and other value adding, Australia's current nearly $2 billion a year deficit in forest products could be turned into a $413 million surplus within five years and a $6.5 billion annual surplus by the year 2030. What is more, the job opportunities will see employment rise from around 70,000, which we have at the moment, to over 200,000. Is there anyone in this House, or anyone in this nation, who believes that those opportunities can afford to be missed by this country? Is there anyone? What has the government done? It is only now that we see some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the question of parliamentary standards and respect for the people's institution. A fundamental point has been highlighted again this week by the Prime Minister's refusal to sack the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in the wake of the Marks royal commission. This man has absolutely no regard for the elementary proprieties of our democratic system. He treats the parliament, and therefore by extension the Australian people, with absolute contempt. His arrogance is nothing short of an insult to the Australian people. That is the bottom line. Not since Gough Whitlam paraded in this place have we been saddled with a Prime Minister who so totally thumbs his nose at parliamentary convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frightening aspect of this is that it is having a very serious effect&mdash;a corrosive effect, as a journalist put it in this country recently&mdash;out there in the broader Australian community. That endearing quality of the Australian people to treat their leaders and their public institutions with a degree of scepticism is changing. It is now rolling over into a hostile and open cynicism&mdash;a corrosive, hostile and open cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often talk to school groups. I never seek to politicise my conversations with them in any way, but when I see school kids I say to them in good faith, `Stick your paw in the air if you have heard your mums and dads say that they lack faith now in our parliamentary institutions, if they think politicians make a mess of it and they think behaviour in this place is no good.' Do you know what invariably happens? The whole lot of them put their hands up. I say, `Put your hands down. How many of you think we ought to be doing a better job of it.' They almost invariably put their hands up again. That is a very frightening thing. Not only is it reflecting the fact that the current voters are openly hostile and cynical about what we are doing, but it is also a clear indication that the next generation will as well, unless we do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about it. The prime driver in recent years of that hostility, cynicism and distrust is the man who currently occupies the Lodge. That reason alone is sufficient for those who have governed over there for 13 years to go at the next election. A parliamentary democracy is dependent upon faith and trust between the elected and the electors. If you go beyond a certain point, if you corrode that relationship excessively, then you bring the whole thing undone. The whole great blessing, if you like, of parliamentary democracy starts to unravel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to see some journalists start to draw some attention to this in recent days. I do like that word `corrosive'. It describes it well. We are well warned. The Australian people, I believe, will act on that as soon as they are given the opportunity, and that ought to be as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us return to the issue of the Marks royal commission. We had a total of 14 people testifying there to the effect that the recollection of Carmen Lawrence of the events relating to the tabling of a petition in the Western Australian parliament concerning Penny Easton in 1992 was not accurate. No fewer than eight of those people were former state cabinet ministers in Carmen Lawrence's government. It is extraordinary to be dumped on by eight of your own former cabinet colleagues. The law of averages says that there has to be a greater chance that these people are right and Dr Lawrence is wrong. That is what the commissioner concluded. He found that Dr Lawrence had not told the truth about the extent of her knowledge of the petition before it was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logical, unequivocal and unavoidable consequences of such a finding, according to all accepted parliamentary standards, should be for Carmen Lawrence to offer her resignation or, if she fails to do so, for the Prime Minister to sack her. But it has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this administration such proprieties are simply not respected. Carmen Lawrence did not offer her resignation. The Prime Minister did not seek it and the Prime Minister did not sack her, even though the Western Australian opposition leader, Mr McGinty, personally told the Prime Minister six months ago that Dr Lawrence's recollection of events was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still get no action, even though the Prime Minister knew six months ago that his health minister was not being accurate in her reflection of the truth. He knew because he had been told by Jim McGinty. Even back then he should have demanded that she stand down. But, no, nothing of the sort happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of standards has now become so important that the Australian people cannot ignore it. This is their House. This is their institution. And we see this sort of story: `The incredible shrinking house'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the parliament is prevailed over by a man who has so demeaned not only his own position but that of the office that he occupies that this country must have a change in order that people's faith can be rebuilt, in order that we can cooperate together as one people under a government concerned and determined to pull Australians together as one people, instead of ruling, as this man does whilst talking about us as one Australia, by the old and nasty trick of division. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an opposition leader who in 1995 has set out to disown everything he has ever stood for, who has gone back on every commitment he has given the Australian people for 20 years and who thinks he can slink into office by disowning all of his own principles. It does not matter which area you look at. It does not matter whether it is the industrial relations reform that he held out as the most important single challenge facing modern Australia, facing contemporary politicians, it does not matter whether it is the question of Asian immigration, his views on the monarchy, cutting government expenditure or slashing Medicare, in each and every one of these areas we have seen backflip after backflip.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to take part in this debate and to draw attention to the deceitful manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has sought to have Australian workers believe that they will not be any worse off under a Howard government. He has set out with the able assistance, I might say, of the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate in a pretence by borrowing the government's rhetoric about the no disadvantage test and saying that they will not be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He pretends at every turn that the opposition's no disadvantage test is really a rough equivalent of the government's no disadvantage test, while all the time their no disadvantage test, of course, is not against the existing circumstances of the worker, not against the total award entitlements of the worker, but against an unspecified list of minima being dribbled out by the member for Flinders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last one dribbled out was equal pay for work of equal value&mdash;something that has been entrenched in the Australian workplace for more than 20 years. People are now supposed to sit back and say, `Isn't it wonderful? They've given us this marvellous, generous concession,' when the minima is actually going to be equal pay for work of equal value. But, wait for it, when it comes to CRA, when it comes to practice over the last two weeks, what do they propose to do there? There is no support for the union movement in their call for equal pay for work of equal value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere more so than in industrial relations and transport do you see illustrated, in the greatest possible fashion, the deception, the absolute deceit of the Leader of the Opposition. That is apparent nowhere more so than in the no disadvantage test. Day after day the member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition try to deceive Australian workers into thinking they will be protected. Yet all the time they know that under their policy any worker changing employment will face the contract or not get the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the situation at CRA for the past two years&mdash;a situation that has been addressed by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission using the powers of compulsory arbitration provided under the Industrial Relations Reform Act to force the parties to the table, to see a return to work, to see an end to the national maritime dispute, to see an end to the national coal dispute and to see already awarded an 18 months backdated eight per cent pay increase to the workers who have been so badly disadvantaged as a result of the policies promoted by CRA, the sorts of policies the opposition would see the length and breadth of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way that these people can pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate as far as the no disadvantage test is concerned, because Australian workers love their awards, and rightly so. They know that the fundamental protection of the award system is at the very heart and the very soul of what is necessary for their guaranteed security, not only for themselves but for their wives or husbands, as the case may be, and for their whole families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This opposition pretend to talk about the values of the family. What would they do in opposition?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that the opposition leader should be condemned for is his miserable effort in trying to disguise his absolute intentions in his respect, because day after day he turns up, says one thing and then immediately backs away from it.

That, of course, is the first wave that they say they are endorsing; the first wave that they are proud today to say is a good thing for Western Australia; the first wave that sees nurses paid $5,000 per year less when they change employment, because they lose all the protections of the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the other area of my administration, transport, where we see again the bare-faced deceit of the Leader of the Opposition, who would deceive the electors of Sydney into thinking that they will get some relief from aircraft noise. Day after day, he has said that all he wants to do is share the burden; see the noise spread over a wider area of Sydney. But all the time all he really wants to do is prop up his personal support in Bennelong; prop up his own votes to save his own miserable electoral skin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the process we see the absolute and utter dishonesty about his true intentions or the effect of those intentions. The reality is very simple and very sweet: he is saying&mdash;and the Senate committee majority today said&mdash;that they would leave it to Airservices Australia to determine what the flight paths in and out of Sydney airport would be. That is a big change from what they were saying until a few days ago; they were saying that one of their first acts in office would be to reopen the east-west runway. But this week we have seen the Senate majority committee, chaired by the shadow minister for aviation, say that it should be left to Airservices Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Airservices Australia have spelt out their view not once, not twice, but four times in the clearest possible terms, in their position papers, each and every one of them: Civil Aviation Authority, as far back as 30 November 1994; spelt out again on 3 August 1995; spelt out a third time on 14 August 1995 and spelt out a fourth time by Mr Bill Pollard, the new chief executive of Airservices Australia. It was clearly stated that the Airservices Australia organisation believed that parallel runways give capacity and safety. That is their view, yet the opposition would seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the electors of Sydney and say, `Elect us and suddenly this noise burden will be lifted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the opposite will be the case because there is no doubt that, if the opposition had their way, the parallel runways would receive more use, not less use. Airservices Australia have made that clear. This is not really a case of reopening the east-west runway; it is a case of take-offs to the north on the parallel runway. That is where Senator Parer was well and truly tripped up last Sunday, and he spent most of this week backing away from what he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the advantage of asking Mr Bill Pollard of Airservices Australia what he believes we should do. I had him in my office yesterday. I said to him, `You are now the boss of this outfit. If you had the choice of reopening the east-west runway or having take-offs to the north on runway 34 right, which would you choose?' He said, `We would take 34 right, take-offs to the north, because that would give us greater capacity and greater safety. If we were to have any change in runway configuration, that is what we would do. That would give us 85 take-offs and landings with optimum safety in each direction irrespective of the wind.' That is exactly what the door was left open for by Senator Parer's report brought down in the Senate today. It will not mean less noise; it will mean more noise. It will be no protection from noise. Yet all the time the opposition says, `Trust us. We are just for sharing the noise burden over Sydney.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point where the Leader of the Opposition has been absolutely derelict in his duty and has betrayed the interests of Sydney and of all Australian citizens has been the manner in which he has used and abused his Senate numbers only this week to see the bill to provide for the leasing of the airports knocked over most viciously and maliciously in the Senate&mdash;a $2 billion hit on the budget forward estimates and at the very same time the destruction of the chance for the completion of Badgerys Creek airport in time for the 2000 Olympics. That is what it means. We all know the critical path and we all know that we are right hard up against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, I have built a few things in my life. I know what it takes to build things. I will tell you what it takes. It needs a darned lot of momentum and it needs some imperatives. We have had the momentum: in the time that I have had responsibility for Badgerys Creek we have seen it drawn up from a 1,800-metre taxiway to a 2,900-metre runway. We have seen provisions made available for the funding of a terminal, a control tower, a general aviation facility and firefighting facilities. We have seen it taken further and expanded to provide for the future development of a 4,000 metre runway. We have seen $500 million committed to this purpose. We have seen almost $500 million committed to building the road infrastructure to link Badgerys Creek to Sydney airport&mdash;all told almost $1 billion worth of momentum that this government has built over the last 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been destroyed by the decision of the opposition to block the airport leasing bills. What happens when you lose momentum on a great project like this and lose the imperative? Have no doubt that the momentum and the imperative were to get this thing done in time for the 2000 Olympics. That has gone; that has been destroyed. Despite all John Howard's preaching over the years about micro-economic reform and the absolute essential nature of this development of parallel runways at Kingsford Smith airport, today that has been thrown into a complete spin and destroyed as a result of those sitting opposite.

He is the minister responsible for ANL, the Australian National Line, which is basically run by the unions and which has been one of the greatest loss making enterprises in the history of the Commonwealth government. He is the minister basically responsible for the system that has allowed the problems at Weipa to happen, which has been one of the great humiliations for this government&mdash;particularly when Bob Hawke was brought back by Bill Kelty to solve the issues that the Prime Minister was unable to solve.

This must be one of the most open-and-shut cases I have seen of a minister failing to match appropriate standards. To support my case, I want to refer to some of the remarks of Commissioner Marks, who has examined the minister's conduct in the Easton affair. Let me go to one aspect of his report which was, in a sense, unrelated to the petition. It is an example of the lengths to which the minister has gone to cover up and defend her position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence even more clearly told an untruth to the Press Club at Canberra on 19 April 1995 when she said that she knew on Wednesday, 4 November that she would be exonerated in regard to the imprest account:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . I clearly want to debunk the claim that I seized on this petition as a way to deflect attention from a police inquiry into my imprest account.

At the time that she proceeded with her legal claim, to try to stop the commission from inquiring into the truth of her remarks, she knew exactly that there was going to be a controversy about it. There she was, Madam Innocent, attempting to suggest that when the decision was made to proceed with the legal claim she was somehow unaware of the controversy. </PARA>

It is pretending today to be different, more compassionate and more capable. It is none of the above and today's performance in this House, I think, attests adequately to the lack of talent on that side of the parliament. It is also an opposition prepared to resort to deceit, not just in the cover-up of its own policy prescription, of its own hidden agenda, but in also depicting the government's record of achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate on the area of employment because it seems to be an area that all on that side have alluded to. I make this point at the outset: there is no stronger commitment by this government in any policy area than to getting the unemployment rate down. It is a commitment we are pursuing through sustained economic growth, which has seen 621,000 jobs created since the last election. It is also a policy prescription pursued through the massive commitment of resources to target this time around in the recovery those groups that otherwise would get left behind, the people for whom the economic recovery would pass over&mdash;the long-term unemployed and the long-term youth unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is those groups that we have allocated specific attention to, as well as, I might add, ensuring that the skills level of the country is raised, that we are not just employing people but we are training and skilling them at the same time. We know that the jobs of the future are increasingly going to require certain levels of skills. Unless we address the skill formation agenda sensibly, our capacity to grow as a nation on any sustained basis will be severely restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On both counts, the economic growth and the resources, this is a government that has delivered. We saw just yesterday the 17th quarter of economic growth in a row; 51 months of economic growth on the trot. That is the best record achieved since the war. The economic growth which is producing the job activity is a record of significant achievement. On the question of job creation over the term of the government, let us look at the figures between 1983 and today. The labour force has grown by close to 30 per cent in that period and employment has grown by 31.3 per cent. It is the fastest labour force growth and the fastest job creator of all OECD countries in that period. Some failure!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the performance of the government since the last election, I remind the House of the election commitment that we made and gave primacy to: the creation of 500,000 jobs over the term of this government. This was a promise that was ridiculed by the opposition and by the current Leader of the Opposition, who said, `It is unachievable and it is an insult to the intelligence of the Australian public that the Labor Party should get up there and promise it.' Promise it we did and deliver it we did. We passed the target six months ago. We have produced 621,000 jobs, not 500,000 jobs, in less than three years. Some failure!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the commitment that the government has made through the Working Nation program, the most significant commitment ever made by a government in terms of resource allocation to lifting employment, the labour force and the skill base of the country&mdash;a commitment of $9 billion over four years and we are only one year into it. Look at what that has achieved. We have seen the unemployment rate fall. It is now at 8.7 per cent, but it was at 11.2 per cent. In trend terms, I might add, it is steady at the 8.5 per cent figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the long-term unemployed, the people that we said we would re-engage and would not leave behind, of the 621,000 jobs created, over 100,000 of them have gone to the long-term unemployed. You compare that with the economic period from 1983 to 1989 when we also presided over a long growth period in this economy in which, out of the 1.6 million jobs then created, the long-term unemployed only picked up 100,000 jobs. We have bettered that figure when compared with the one six years earlier. That shows the importance of targeted measures. It demonstrates that, by focusing on the real issue and directing resources, we can achieve results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The question of youth unemployment is a critical area for activity. The reason I say that is that the opposition have got no policy to solve youth unemployment. First, they want to send around a bus, the coach of cant, and say that they will consult with youth, and now they have a truck that is going around to highlight the high level of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) indicated earlier in his address, to say that youth unemployment is at 27 per cent is just a nonsense. What it is saying is that 27 out of every 100 are out of work. The reality is that it is not 27 out of 100 of the total of the youth cohort, the total of the youth population, because the vast bulk of them remain in school or are in training. It is 27 per cent of those who are not still in school or in training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it is so high is the obvious fact that training and education improves a person's employability. If they have dropped out of school, if they are not undertaking training, their chances of getting employment are significantly reduced. They are harder to place, and we acknowledge that. The simple fact remains that, when John Howard left office, there were 158,000 young people unemployed. Today there are 95,000. That figure is still far too high, but it is a significant improvement on what we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yesterday the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) asked me a question in this House. He asked me why we were no longer publishing the quarterly figures on youth unemployment. My response to the House that, in essence, we were not publishing because of the unreliability of the data was greeted with some derision by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the opposition should listen a bit more carefully to what some of their own Liberal colleagues had to say on this point. Listen to this because I think it is important for you when you go around running the lie again. In relation to quarterly unemployment figures, in the Senate estimates committee back in May Senator Tierney said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about the same ones referred to yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">come out every month. Do you have any view on the confusion that this is creating? . . . This applies fairly obviously to a small region. The ABS figures tend to bounce around a fair bit because of small samples.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have confidence in the ABS figures as quoted for New South Wales. ABS's sampling techniques become very inaccurate at the lower level. Unfortunately, some of our parliamentary colleagues tend to quote these figures if they look favourable in a particular month, which tends to be misleading.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! We have found a Liberal that is prepared to tell the truth. This was not true of the member for Canberra yesterday, when he sought to exploit that issue yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Chief Minister of the ACT, Kate Carnell, have to say when the Canberra figures came out on youth  unemployment under the same analysis? She called on the Australian Bureau of Statistics to rethink its methodology. Mrs Carnell said that it was almost impossible to identify accurate trends because of the data used by the ABS in compiling unemployment levels among the 15- to 19-year-olds in the ACT. She is another Liberal&mdash;although they are hard to find&mdash;who is prepared to tell the truth. I accept that people on the other side want to use figures. They can still have access to the data and produce whatever figures they want, but they at least should be honest enough to acknowledge the unreliability of the data because of the small samples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A point I made yesterday was that I am not trying to address this question of youth unemployment from the basis of just looking at the statistics. However, I think we have to put the issue into some perspective. That is why I have spent some time in terms of the statistics. This government has a huge commitment to addressing youth unemployment as a discrete and targeted measure. We know that training improves a young person's employability. The simple statistics are that you are twice as likely to be unemployed if you do not have year 12 than if you have year 12 or better. Eighty-four per cent of people who go through a traineeship are still in employment 12 months after the traineeship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those facts are right, what do we need to do to open up traineeships and training options for young people much more effectively? We have done it under Working Nation. We have opened up traineeships in a whole range of industries and areas that hitherto did not have them&mdash;areas such as the environment; areas such as arts, sport and the media; areas such as information technology; and areas such as the traditional craft industries of automotive and construction, where we are offering options other than just apprenticeships. The fact that we have opened up traineeships has seen a huge jump in the demand for traineeships in this country. So the demand for that type of labour is responding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are offering new opportunities for our young people, but I am prepared to go the next step. I am prepared to say, `Yes, it is a legitimate expectation that if young people go through the training they are entitled to a job.' What we are working on at the moment is making that link. We are putting together the programs that deliver the training at the one end and give the job offer at the other end. That is an initiative that was launched recently and one which I am looking to expand upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we as a community have an obligation to the young people of this country. We have to give them new hope and confidence that they can pursue a rewarding career with some dignity. In my view, the report tabled earlier this week that projected where the jobs would be in the year 2005 holds great promise for young people because it says that the jobs are there&mdash;2.1 million of them are capable of being secured over the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue is how we can prepare young people to be better able to compete for those jobs. We have created 621,000 jobs over the last 2 1/2 years. But the issue is not whether we can produce the jobs; the issue is how we can get young people into them. The sorts of programs that I have been talking about will get them into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that we do not address this policy as just being good for young people. It also needs to be good family policy, because the most important family policy that we can produce as a government is a policy that ensures children have an opportunity for a rewarding career and a secure future. That is what this government is setting itself to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked about our record, but where does the opposition stand in terms of their policy? They have given up. They have actually said that the five per cent target&mdash;which is our unemployment target by the year 2000&mdash;is unachievable, just as they said that our 500,000 job target was unachievable. Well, we achieved the 500,000 jobs, and we will achieve five per cent unemployment as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that only this government is prepared to commit itself to a target. The opposition has given up. What is the point of sending a truck around the country to talk about the problem of youth unemployment if you have given up on reaching an unemployment target?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have also given up on committing resources. The only programs the shadow Treasurer has nominated to be cut if they get into office are the Working Nation programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, because we adhere to the standards of ministerial responsibility, we want her removed. The government is not doing itself any service in a political sense by retaining her. She should be removed so that we can again entrench this concept of political and ministerial responsibility. Of course, the government will lash out in all directions to protect her. Again we saw the colour drain from the faces of those on the Labor benches when the Prime Minister said that it was a Burke squad attack on her that brought her down. He says that, on the one hand, it is a Liberal Party conspiracy but, on the other hand, it is really a Labor Party conspiracy. It is a conspiracy by the Burke squad. </PARA>

She was the instrument of her own destruction. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) is a member of the Burke squad.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the Deputy Prime Minister had to sit there in humiliation hearing the Prime Minister attribute the downfall of Dr Lawrence to the Burke squad, of which he is a paid-up and leading member. He was the one who gave a reference for disgraced and gaoled Brian Burke in court. So of course he is a close friend, then and now. But his personal loyalty is not the issue. The issue is that he has been tagged as a member of the Burke squad which conspired together within the Labor Party to bring down the minister for health. </PARA>

He is usually a cheery little fellow who sits over there with nice interjections.

Just think back to his predecessor, Peter Nixon, and the contribution that he made to this chamber in the Old Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would not have had Peter Nixon supporting the privatisation of Telstra or the deregulation of Australia Post because of what that would have done to people who live in the bush. You would not have had the National Party of Doug Anthony rolling over and letting the Liberal Party tell them that they are going to privatise Telstra or they are going to deregulate Australia Post. You certainly would not have had the member for Gippsland's predecessor, Peter Nixon, tapping the mat and letting the Liberal Party say what they are going to wreak on rural and provincial Australia if they have their way. But it is good to have the member for Gippsland here in this chamber. It is probably an alternative to having the boys run the family business, and for that reason alone we are pleased to have him here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The point I would like to make is that this censure motion gives us a chance to look at the comparison between the policies and the achievements of this government versus the alternative which the opposition has tried to put forward in the last years it has been in opposition. If you take a quick snapshot of what has been achieved by the government in the last three years, you cannot help but be impressed. We are the first federal government that has been prepared to address an issue, such as Mabo, that is of national importance in this country. I know it upsets you in the National Party that the government had the courage to address it, but we did. We have provided more stability for people who want to invest in mining and other development issues, as well as giving Aboriginal Australians their right to proper recognition of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have been able to address the issue of unemployment. Through Working Nation we have put a massive amount of resources into making sure that more Australians have got a chance to get a job, that young Australians are better trained to get a job and in particular that those who have been out of work for the longest get the greatest assistance from the government in getting back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Through the efforts of the Prime Minister we have been able to pull off the Bogor declaration, pull off a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region which will ensure that Australia, as a country that benefits from free trade, continues to get greater access into markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We have been able to make sure that through Creative Nation we are looking after our cultural industries and we are making sure that Australia remains at the leading edge in the development of new forms of communications technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the reforms in superannuation, we are building up Australia's national savings and we are making sure that more Australians have enough money behind them on their retirement so that they do not have to rely only on the pension. Through the drought relief package, we have made sure those farmers who were hurt hardest by the drought received assistance from the federal government. We have led the debate on the republic, much to the outrage of a few people on the other side of the House. We have had the telecommunications review, the most important review that has been released this year, and, of course, next week we will have the Prime Minister releasing the innovation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have had a whole series of measures month after month indicating that the government is taking forward the policy debate and making sure that Australia is ready for the important issues that are before the country. The alternative was adequately explained on the front-page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today. The headline was `The risk of becoming an invisible man' and it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard has managed to make himself so small a target for Labor that he runs the risk of becoming invisible to the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA>That sums it up: the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the incredible shrinking man, the man who says that truth is so important to him. This is what he said on 25 August 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.</PARA>
<PARA>The man who says he supports truth is the man who does not want to tell us what his policies are, the man who refuses to outline the policy details of the Liberal and National parties in the lead-up to the next election and the man who refuses to take the Australian people into his confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just run through a few of the issues where we do not know what the opposition will do. The first is on Telstra and the opposition's bland commitment to privatise Telstra. We had the Leader of the Opposition making it clear that, as far as he is concerned, he will have the foreign telephone companies having a large chunk of Telstra. We have had Senator Alston, the official spokesman on communications, making it clear that there will be significant foreign telephone companies owning shares in Telstra when they privatise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the shadow minister with responsibility for privatisation, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, happens to have a different view. She was in the paper a week ago saying that she will not let the foreign telephone companies own any shares in Telstra, even if it means that she gets $10,000 million less for the sale of Telstra&mdash;a $10 billion lower price because she will not let the foreign telephone companies have a chunk of Telstra. That is a totally different position from that of both the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian people have to ask themselves: do they want British Telecom to own 49 per cent of Telstra? Do they really want American Telephone and Telegraph to have 49 per cent of Telstra? Do they want France Telecom to have a big chunk of Telstra? I can tell you this: if the opposition privatises Telstra and the foreign telephone companies have got a large chunk of Telstra, I do not want those foreign telephone companies making decisions about Australia's future telecommunications infrastructure. I certainly do not want them deciding whether or not Telstra will be up in Asia winning business for Australia, making Australia the telecommunications hub for the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would British Telecom let its part owned subsidiary, Telstra, be up in the region competing with British Telecom for business? That is the important question you have to ask. If the opposition do privatise Telstra, even if the shadow minister at the table has her way and there are no foreign telephone companies owning Telstra today, what stops them owning it in the future? What stops the new owner of Telstra, once it is privatised, breaking Telstra up and selling off the most profitable bits&mdash;selling off the mobile telephony, selling off the international business&mdash;leaving nothing but the loss making areas in the bush. If you take away the cross-subsidies for Telstra, the people in the bush are the ones who will be hit hardest by the privatisation of Telstra. The people in the bush are the ones who want to know what the Leader of the Opposition means when he says he will privatise Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On Australia Post we have seen that the Leader of the Opposition has said that he wants to implement the Industry Commission report on Australia Post. He wants to deregulate our postal services. I will tell you what that means. It means that 1,300 post offices will close; it means that there will be at least 9,000 jobs lost; it means that the Liberal Party is arguing to walk away from the standard letter rate across the country. That is, if someone in the gallery sends a letter to some relations in the bush, they will be paying more than the standard letter rate&mdash;more than 45c to send a letter to the bush. If you happen to live in the bush and you have to pay the real price for every letter that you send to business colleagues or every bill that you pay which gets sent to the capital city, that is going to cost an absolute fortune. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When John Howard said he wanted to implement the Industry Commission report into deregulating Australia Post he was saying that he supports the introduction of what they call the maximum affordable price for postal services. That means that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that once you deregulate Australia Post they should be charging whatever they think the consumer can afford to pay. It certainly means that we will no longer have that standard letter rate or the freeze on that 45c standard letter rate that we have had from 1992, and that is going to stay until 1997. It is going to mean that all those post offices will close and that jobs will be lost. Why? Because they are obsessed with this dry, rationalist economic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister at the table, the member for Mackellar, is the one who fights hardest for that Thatcherite policy and believes most strongly in privatising and deregulating. So perhaps the onus is on her to tell us why they believe in implementing that Industry Commission report. On cross-media ownership, the government has stated very clearly that we stand by the limits on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition in 1991 signed a petition saying they were against any further increase in media concentration; they were against Mr Packer getting control of the Fairfax group. Yet in more recent times we have had the Leader of the Opposition walk away from that commitment of 1991. He was asked about this by Ray Martin who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What about the suggestion that in fact you were party to a petition in 1991 that called for tougher rules?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well that was the Opposition's policy at that particular time. I wasn't the leader then and I wasn't the spokesman on communications. I went along as a team player.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened to the idea that truth is supreme and that truth is never disposable in national political life? Apparently it is disposable on cross-media ownership because the Leader of the Opposition has a very different position today from the one he had in 1991. He refuses to answer that very specific question, `Do you think someone should be able to own a newspaper and a television station in the same city?' He says he will have a review. He will do anything but give us a clear outline of the opposition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Come the next election we are going to have a very clear choice: a leader who has introduced the reforms of Mabo, Working Nation, Bogor, Creative Nation, the republic, the innovation statement, the drought relief package and superannuation; or a furry ball. The choice is a leader like the Prime Minister or a man who has rolled himself up into a cuddly little furry ball and refuses to tell the Australian people where he stands on these issues. I don't think the people of Australia want a furry ball for their Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I look at the motion that was moved by John Howard earlier this afternoon. The censure against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deals with a number of topics. The first is the Prime Minister's continued failure to give economic prosperity. He has created great uncertainty and burdens for families, individuals, young people, seniors, small businessmen and farmers. The second is that the Prime Minister has failed to uphold the standards required of a Prime Minister. The third is that he has failed in his policy to deliver anything but false dawns; and the fourth is that he has continued to fail to deliver what he promised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak in this debate because of my concern for my country. I came into politics because I wanted to have a say in what happened to my country. History taught me that there were two groups of people in the world: those who had decisions made for them and those who were part of that decision making process. In speaking to this debate, I want to make the point: there is another way. The Prime Minister has followed the philosophy of collectivism, of which socialism is one part&mdash;and it doesn't work. It delivers lower standards of living, greater dependency and less freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our parties are worlds apart. Ours is a party that believes in the freedom of the individual and in the principles of free enterprise. Free enterprise can offer this country a different set of policies and a different way that leads to the prosperity of all Australians. That is what this next election is going to be about. The principles of free enterprise are as immutable as the laws of gravity. They tell us several things. The first is that government doesn't have any money of its own; it has only the money that it first takes from the earnings and savings of individuals. When it gives money away it has to take it from the earnings and savings of individuals. There is no such thing as government money. It is taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister says, `This is as good as it gets,' for him that is true. He has a house worth $2.2 million and a very high standard of living for himself and his family. But what about the ordinary punter and the mums and dads for whom there was no recovery at all. That is exactly what has happened in this country: there is no recovery for ordinary folks. Again and again when you go to open a trade fair or you talk with small business people&mdash;and these are the people who survived the recession we had to have and are supposedly in this recovery period&mdash;you find they are struggling to make ends meet and, at every turn, they find that government oppresses them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles of free enterprise can work for this nation because they tell us that the business of government is twofold: it's about providing those things which the private sector cannot or will not provide and providing for those who cannot provide for themselves. Yet here we have in government a Prime Minister who seems to be hell-bent on destroying this country which he then thinks he can leave to go and live somewhere in Europe. It is either that or we have a Prime Minister who is no longer able to make decisions for the benefit of all Australians; who is so isolated and perturbed that you could say he needs help to straighten out his mental condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His bad language, his failure to follow the rules of decency and his upholding of lies as an acceptable way of parliamentary life show a complete and absolute lack of morality and ethics in government. I define morality very simply as the motive and intention behind the action. We condemn this government for what it has done; that is, it has lowered our standard of living, brought uncertainty to thousands of families, failed in policy to give direction whereby the country can prosper, and failed to deliver on the Prime Minister's promises. Of these, probably the failure to deliver on the tax cuts which were made l-a-w law is the most cynical of the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this parliament we hear the Prime Minister again and again in a reckless manner attempt to assert lies as being the truth, on the basis, presumably, that if you repeat it a number of times it makes it stick. I heard the Prime Minister, who described the Senate as swill, stand the other day and say somehow that it was the opposition which had no respect for the institutions of our country&mdash;but it is the other way around. It is shown at every turn that there is no respect for the institution of parliament or the conventions that attach to it whereby resignation is required if a minister is found to have lied, as has happened in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This censure, fundamentally, is about the failure to deliver economically for the people of Australia. I think it is time to look at some good concrete figures. Let us look at some distinctions between Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The OECD indicators of living standards, namely the GDP per capita and private consumption per capita, are used to assess Australia's performance relative to that of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. While New Zealand's position in the top GDP per capita countries improved between 1970 and the early 1990s, and Britain's remained unchanged, Australia's position fell by five places&mdash;from 12th to 17th. The average increase in OECD countries in GDP per capita in the same period was 505 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded this average by scoring an increase of 515 per cent and 616 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, managed only 377 per cent. While Australia had a substantially higher living standard in the late 1960s relative to the United Kingdom and New Zealand, this comparative advantage has all but disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972 New Zealand's GDP per capita was half that of Australia's. In 1990 it was three-quarters that of Australia's. Similarly, Britain's GDP per capita was 76 per cent that of Australia's but in 1990 it increased to 99 per cent. Australia has scored even worse, using consumption per capita as an indicator of living standards. The OECD average increase in consumption per capita, again between 1972 and 1990, was 390 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded that average, achieving increases of 437 per cent and 740 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, achieved a below average growth of 342 per cent. Furthermore, in 1972 New Zealand's consumption per capita was 49 per cent of Australia's, while in 1990 the percentage increased to 90 per cent. In 1972 British consumption per capita was 82 per cent of Australia's. In 1990 Britain surpassed Australia, with a 106 per cent increase. Australia very simply deserves better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophical backup of the policies that this government has put in place over the last 13 years has resulted in this drop in the standard of living. This uncertainty has resulted in parts of our society no longer being able to cope. We have the highest youth suicide rate in the world, something that must be a shame in this country. Where are our provisions for leadership in this federal parliament, in the government ranks, to set standards and to set examples for the way young people should aspire to behave? Is it surprising that so many young people lose hope, that they do not see that there is any opportunity for them in this land under this government, that they do not see that there is a future for them? What a tragedy it is that somehow those sitting on the other side of the table think that is amusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating this censure, my colleagues have outlined again and again instances of where this government has let the people down. They have dealt with, one after another, the way convention is broken, the way standards are broken, the way bluster, toughing it out, seems to have become the order of the day. We have had the supreme example in this very House. We have had the Solicitor-General say that the only reason that the Commonwealth government, and thereby the taxpayer, could be held responsible for paying the legal bills of Carmen Lawrence was that the royal commission in Western Australia was testing whether she was fit for public office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the Prime Minister say that he is going to pay no attention to the findings of that royal commission and force through in this set of appropriation bills, namely Appropriation Bill (No. 4), payment of certain of those bills, having acquiesced to the Senate's determination that those parts of the fees which were attributable to Carmen Lawrence's attempt to shut down the royal commission should not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare the sheer effrontery of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) saying that he would introduce it again next year to recoup that money so that all of Carmen Lawrence's bills would be paid by the taxpayer with the difficulties that ordinary folks have in getting legal aid. In New South Wales there is, for instance, virtually no money left for civil actions. It is hard to get money for criminal actions. Certainly nothing like $800,000 is made available. There is also nothing like $5,000 a day being paid for a top silk coming right across the continent to present the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see here two standards. We see one standard for the government, which is that the only people who prosper under this Labor government are those who lead it. The current Prime Minister, when he said it is never going to get any better, was quite right&mdash;for him personally, and for his mates. But ordinary people simply want the right to their hopes and aspirations; the right to see their children grow and reach their horizons of hope; the right to see a nation that is proud of the leadership that it gets. Those are the things that this country is entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I rise to speak in this debate out of concern for my nation, the Australian people, and concern for the fact that we have a government that continues to let them down. I stress that if we follow those principles of free enterprise then we too can return to prosperity and the sort of hope that the Australian people are entitled to. The speaker before me, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), attempted again to use one of those sets of lies which he intends to repeat.

It will remain in Australian ownership because we want to see it strong and prosperous and owned not by a minister of the Crown but by the people. Secondly, community service obligations as they exist will continue to exist. There will be no cessation of them. They will be maintained. All that nonsense that the minister went on about that we would do away with them is totally and utterly false. Thirdly, untimed local telephone calls will remain both for individual, that is residential, and business consumers. Fourthly, we will not use the proceeds to squander recurrent expenditure, as this government has done with all the products of its privatisation, but we will ensure that they are used primarily for the retirement of debt.

He has never told us. We know where he has come from. We know that he is trying to reclothe himself and reposition himself. He is trying to minimise himself as a target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has addressed a number of very important social issues over the last few years. They could only have been tackled by a Labor government. The most important of them in many respects was the Mabo decision.

We saw the opposition, as they have done on every piece of progressive legislation in this House since 1983, oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke about the importance of the native title legislation and Mabo on 10 December 1993&mdash;it was a landmark speech in Australian history in Redfern&mdash;he said this:</PARA>

It just happens to line up that way; it is a quirk of fate. The PM, for his part, reckons that the bloke on the other side is nothing but a Queen-loving lickspittle, a little tory from outer Sydney.

Why haven't members in this House actually said that that sort of practice is disreputable and should not be used by politicians? When the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made accusations about former Senator Richardson, the people on the Labor side jumped to their feet to condemn him for it. It was the same when another member made accusations about public servants.

The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) points to the opposition and says that the use of contract labour as per the CRA dispute is what will become law if the coalition gets into government. He is probably right. The problem is that it is already law under the Labor Party. The battlers have been sold out. The enterprise bargaining policy adopted by the federal Labor Party threatens trade unionism as a concept, a symbol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, as we have seen in CRA, that policy drives workers into small groups where they are in danger of being toppled by employers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the trade union response, apart from the fact that it made a big mistake and said it would organise a Labor Party to protect its interests&mdash;which it could never do because from its inception the Labor Party was a revisionist or reformist party? It said, `We have to go for big, strong unions&mdash;one big union.' Out of that developed the IWW and the like. Those blokes&mdash;there weren't a lot of women amongst them&mdash;understood that in unity was strength but it had to be a broad based organisation in trade unionism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members can tell us that this agreement is a victory for workers. All this agreement says is that workers have the right to collectively bargain. If, on the factory floor where there are 100 members all told, 90 of them are on contracts, it would not matter how often you organised to collectively bargain for those 10 because eventually your members would be gone and driven into private contracts.

The assumption of that proposition is that workers are out of work because they are not skilled.

What is wrong with encouraging the super funds to put the money back into Australia rather than follow global trends and send the money offshore to make interest for those people who have their money invested in the super funds? What is wrong with encouraging a bit of economic nationalism? What is wrong with asking that money be invested into the future of our children and into sorting out those suburbs and those municipalities out in the north and west of Melbourne and elsewhere where the true believers live but are being jettisoned by the Labor Party?

My jobsback program was the right course on industrial relations. I am not going to change from that.' But, as soon as there is a bit of strife because of what has happened in Victoria or because of what has happened in WA, John Howard says, `I don't really stand for any of those things.

We have got a whole litany of quotes of the same type, attacking the government's superannuation arrangements, attacking that strong development of a national savings strategy through superannuation, which already has achieved $200 billion of superannuation assets with that figure to grow massively over the next few years as a result of the measures the government introduced in the budget this year. </PARA>

The only reason why people want to rejoice about that is because it is under $2 billion.

Economic recovery is a complete illusion. It has not crawled off the pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and into the pockets of ordinary Australians. Your mortgage costs more and your house is worth less. That is the reality of life under this government. There are 800,000 unemployed. What does the Prime Minister say to them?

There is the fraud and the hypocrisy. There is the betrayal of a Prime Minister who has abandoned the workers that he has always claimed to represent. Ben Chifley and John Curtin would turn in their graves to see what this government has done. We have a Prime Minister who goes to a Labor area when he wants a safe seat, but as soon as he is looking for a nice house, he goes off to the silvertails in the eastern suburbs.

In parliament when asked what had really happened she kept saying, `My recollection is my recollection.' Did she dare repeat what she had said to the National Press Club? Would she dare repeat what she had told the Western Australian parliament? Of course not, because she knew that she was guilty.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Prime Minister under the pressure of defending the Minister for Human Services and Health has gone slightly troppo.

Then, when that looked utterly absurd, it was a Labor Party conspiracy. It was Burke's mob that had done it. The fact is that this Prime Minister is shackled to a political corpse.

There was the third runway that was supposed to mean more take-offs and less noise, and the opposite has been the case. There was the consumption tax that in 1985 he said we must have and in 1993 he said we would never have. Ever since he has been giving it to us by stealth. There was the privatisation which was supposed to be selling off the nation's silver and which he said we would never have. Now he is giving it to us in spades.

This is a man who embodies misrepresentation and deceit. Of course, the ultimate illustration of this is the government's failure today to accept perfectly reasonable suggestions for truth in advertising legislation. Why will they not accept it?

We just heard from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who presents himself as the future of the Liberal Party. He is a young member recently elected and is the future of the Liberal Party. But who does he take as his political mentor? Bob Santamaria. He has gone all the way back to the 1950s, with Bob Santamaria and John Howard. All the way back to the 1950s and the white picket fence, with John Howard and the mentor of the member for Warringah, Bob Santamaria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reminds me of an interesting incident that happened last year which reflects perfectly on the Liberal Party in the 1990s&mdash;the launch of the book co-authored and co-edited by the members for Menzies (Mr Andrews), Moore (Mr Filing) and Deakin (Mr Aldred). A funny thing about the members for Menzies, Moore and Deakin is that two of the three have been disendorsed from the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The book they wrote was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Heart of Liberalism</EMPHASIS>. The Liberal Party ripped out the heart of liberalism when they disendorsed the member for Deakin, who is in the chamber, and the member for Moore. In their book about the heart of liberalism, the last chapter is entitled `The future of the Liberal Party'. And who is the author of this chapter? Bob Santamaria. They have got Bob Santamaria reciting the future of the Liberal Party in the last chapter of the book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What were the three planks that Santamaria put forward as solutions in the 1990s? The first plank was to send everybody back to the land. The idea was that everyone could go back to the land and live a nice, simple, plain farmer's life with no stress and no family breakdown. The second plank was to send women back to the home&mdash;to take all the women out of the work force and put them back in the kitchen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third plank in Santamaria's chapter on the future of the Liberal Party was to take the technology and put it back in its box. That is a perfect echo of how the member for Warringah thinks: `Ooh. We're scared of technology and progress. We don't want any of that. We don't want any of these highfalutin, new, modern devices like telecommunications. We want to put it back in the box where Santamaria says it deserves to be, where Santamaria wants it to be and where John Howard wants our society to be&mdash;rooted in the 1950s.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fancy the member for Warringah wanting to lecture the House about parliamentary behaviour. This is the member for Warringah who had the hide and the gall to describe the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Jack the Ripper. This is the same member for Warringah who, when he was at the monastery, was known not as Jack the Ripper but as Tony the Stripper. If he wants to engage in those sorts of standards&mdash;jumping fences in and out of the monastery and bringing that low level of behaviour into parliamentary forums&mdash;he is going to get it back with spades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exposes the humbug and the cant of what the opposition have been saying in this debate. It also exposes the funny old position they have got themselves in. In 1993 at the last election, which was not so long ago, they put forward all the things they believed in. They worked for two or three years, and the member for Warringah was in the research team working on all the ideas that the Liberal Party and the National Party really believed in. What they came up with was called Fightback, but that is locked away now like a mad uncle in the attic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition never talks about Fightback, but Fightback reflects all the things they believe in&mdash;the individual employment contracts, the dismantling of Medicare, the 15 per cent GST and the cutting away of all the public sector programs that provide for an equalising and civilising society. They are fundamental political beliefs, and the things that were reflected in the Fightback manifesto are just an echo of Thatcherite philosophy&mdash;the idea that there is no such thing as society: there is government and there are individuals, but there is no partnership between the two; there is no partnership between government and individuals to form a thing called society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their sole role in politics is to push away public sector programs and to push more and more responsibility on to individuals. Of course, the wealthy and the privileged in our society can pick up those responsibilities and entrench their position. For the disadvantaged&mdash;the people they would call battlers&mdash;it is even harder because, without the civilising and equalising role and the great tolerance and liberation of the public sector, those so-called battlers have an even harder lot in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened after 1993 when they found out that the things that they believed in and the policies they supported in Fightback were basically unelectable and unsupported by the Australian people? In 1996 they are going to go to the electorate with things they do not believe in. What sort of empty shell of a party is this? In 1993 they went to the people with all the things they believed in and found out they were unelectable; now they are trying to put on the fraud and the hypocrisy of going to the election next year with all the things that they do not believe in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is exposing the two faces of John Howard. The member for Warringah and other speakers have said, `The Labor Party can't make up its mind. They seem to be campaigning against two John Howards.' There is a perfect reason why we are doing that. There are two John Howards. There is the private John Howard who believes in all the policies of Fightback, and there is the public John Howard who is trying to present himself to the people of Australia as a sensitive New-Age guy&mdash;as a reborn political leader; the sort of leader who eats quiche; the sort of leader who helps little old ladies across the road; the reborn, sensitive New-Age John Howard. It is a fraud and the Australian people will not have a bar of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people know the two faces of John Howard. They know the face of the private John Howard who supports Fightback to his bootstraps. They also know the public John Howard who is now trying to have a massive lend of the Australian people. The Australian people will determine at the next election that they like neither face of John Howard and they will reject both comprehensively at the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reflects something interesting about the coalition at this part of the political cycle. Those opposite know that they are going to the people with the things that they do not believe in. They are sort of half excited and half geed up by the fact that opinion polls show that they are a bit ahead. They are getting around with a hangdog look and saying, `We are really not going to the people and getting a mandate for the things that we believe in.' However, they are half excited about the prospect of a coalition government. </PARA>

It is the same John Howard who adopted that motto when he was Treasurer between 1977 and 1983&mdash;the Treasurer who showed leadership by walking away from the internationalisation of the Australian economy. He is the same Treasurer who showed substantive policy change by walking away from tariff reduction, micro reform, industrial relations reform and  integrating Australia into the Asia-Pacific region. This is the same John Howard who has the hide to come into this parliament on this debate and want to talk about economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition produced some figures from the Business Council. I have a better source of figures&mdash;the Parliamentary Library. Those on the opposite side of the House wish to compare the performance of this government on economic management. Who would they take as their standard? Who would they take as their benchmark? Is it the Menzies government? Would that be a fair comparison with the performance of the Labor government from 1983 to the present?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this parliament we hear the Menzies era described as the utopian age of economic growth, the utopian age of economic performance in Australia and the golden age of Liberal government. Members opposite would surely accept the proposition that it is a valid comparison to look at the economic performance of the Menzies government from 1949 to 1966 against the Hawke-Keating government's performance from 1983 to 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do the figures provided by the Parliamentary Library show? On the key performance measure of growth in GDP per capita per annum the performance of the Menzies government was two per cent and for the Hawke-Keating government it was 2.1 per cent. We are greater than Menzies; we are greater than the golden age on the key measure of economic performance&mdash;GDP per capita per annum. Another measure is employment. Under Menzies the annual growth was 2.1 per cent and under this government it was 2.1 per cent&mdash;just as good. If we take business investment as a proportion of GDP, under Menzies it was 10.7 per cent and under Hawke-Keating it was an average of 10.8 per cent. On inflation, Menzies was 4.6 per cent and under this government it was 5.4 per cent&mdash;trying to wind back from the Howard legacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the key measure, the thing that the Liberal Party and the National Party would really pride themselves on in the 1990s is government outlays&mdash;growth in the public sector. We had an interesting reminder of this just last Sunday on that infamous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program when the Leader of the Opposition said, `Oh, there is not as much fat in the system as there was 15 years ago.' It is almost as if he has forgotten who was in 15 years ago. Who was the Treasurer responsible for a fat budget 15 years ago? J.W. Howard!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this key measure of comparison, let me return to the figures. We are looking at the Menzies period compared with that of Hawke and Keating. For Commonwealth outlays under Menzies we had 2.5 per cent growth per annum; under this government it is 1.5 per cent&mdash;a lean, effective, efficient Labor government. When it comes to Commonwealth taxation we always hear the opposition say that this is a high taxing government. Have a look at Menzies' performance. We see that annual growth in Commonwealth taxation receipts was two per cent and under this government it is 1.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are better than the golden age. This is a new definition of economic utopia established by this government.

So this is a good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was once said of Jack Lang that he was greater than Lenin. When one looks at the economic data, is the opposition now going to confess that Paul Keating is greater than Menzies? What the opposition is basically saying in this debate, and what it will be putting forward at the next campaign, is that on the economic data this government is better than the Menzies government from 1949 to 1966. The opposition is saying, `We have no policies but we want to be in government.' The Labor government has done better than the golden age&mdash;the utopian age&mdash;of Menzies.

Senator Cook said, `It is interesting to ask the question: why does Mrs Gallus have an interest in ending this project? She told the CSIRO it was to give other companies a chance to bid for the contract to erect boardings.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who chaired the foreign affairs subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am pleased to see him in the chamber, although it would have helped if he had been here earlier. I am pleased that this motion gives us the opportunity to discuss matters relating to Thailand. As you mentioned yesterday in the discussion of the paper, I led a parliamentary delegation to Thailand in September of this year. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, were a member of that delegation, and its deputy leader was the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). The other members of the delegation were Senator Watson and the member for Richmond (Mr Newell).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Thailand</EMPHASIS>, produced by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, is a very useful document for those who wish to develop an understanding of matters relating to Thailand. As is mentioned in the foreword to the report, and by members who have already spoken on this subject, the report does not set out to lecture the Thai government. It is directed at a number of issues that are important to the relationship between Australia and Thailand. The report raises issues that are of great importance to us in our dealings with a number of countries throughout the world, particularly in  the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very significant section on industrial relations matters. The committee has made a number of recommendations urging the Australian government to do all that is possible to encourage, persuade and assist the Thai government in ratifying a number of important ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report explains, the Thai government has not entered into any international labour agreements since 1967. As we have already had discussions about labour practices in a number of countries, I do not think that Australia should shy away from placing on record its strong beliefs on matters such as child labour or occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, all of these things have a cultural context but, as an economy and a nation such as Thailand develops, it is important that it understands that there is an international expectation about matters that should go with that development. I do not think that anybody is saying that these things can occur overnight. A number of these things have to be worked at and worked progressively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of items I wish to raise because I think it is important that one gets one's impressions about a country on the record. We hoped to be able to report on our delegation before the end of this year. For a number of reasons, that will now not be possible but we hope to be able to report in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary delegation's visit to Thailand was associated with our status as an observer delegation in the week following in Singapore at the IPO conference. It has been the tradition of IPO observer delegations from Australia to visit an ASEAN country which is a member of IPO, to get a better appreciation of it. As has been said in this debate, and as is said in the report, it would be a bit rich for Australian parliamentary committees and Australian parliamentarians to get up, wax lyrical and highlight problems about a country if, in fact, they had not made the attempt to visit countries to get an understanding about the issues and the cultural context in which those issues are tackled. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) quite rightly highlighted that in his contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the joint committee highlights a number of matters, and I will briefly mention a few of them. One, of course, is the importance of the Thai royal family, in the sense not only of their role as part of a constitutional monarchy, but also of the deep respect and reverence that the people of Thailand have for their royal family. The delegation was in Thailand during the period of mourning for Her Royal Highness the Princess Mother. As part of our duties during the time that we were in Bangkok, we went and paid our respects to the Princess Mother. One of the things that amazed the delegation, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, was the number of people queuing to pay their respects. We were also informed of how many additional visitors had come from rural regions of Thailand to visit Bangkok with the express purpose of paying their respects. To see thousands of people queuing for several hours, dressed in black, some with a great deal of effort, was an indication of the high regard in which the royal family is held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this degree, I think that it is quite appropriate that one of the recommendations of the joint committee's report is that the government investigate how Australia might play its part and join in the celebrations next year of the golden jubilee of His Majesty the King of Thailand's succession to the throne. That anniversary will occur on 9 June 1996. In the context of what I observed as part of the delegation, I think that that is a quite an appropriate recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that is always raised with anybody visiting Bangkok is the problem of traffic. In our planning for the delegation, I thought that this was perhaps overstated. When we tried to find out why we had only one appointment in the morning and one in the afternoon&mdash;it seemed a pretty light workload and I did not wish to have the allegation made that we were in some way a slack delegation&mdash;we were told that, realistically, it was about all we could expect because we would spend the rest of the time stuck in traffic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On most occasions we were fairly lucky as, with the assistance of the constabulary, we were able to wend our way through the traffic in a relatively efficient manner, sometimes in a fairly scary manner, because you drive up the wrong side of the road with horns blazing and people waving gloved palms that somehow magically stop you. Bangkok traffic is symbolic of a great problem that Thailand has to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with Dr Narongchai, who is a respected financier and economist who heads up the Thai-Australia Business Council. He was educated in Western Australia and his two children are being educated in Victoria, one at Geelong Grammar and one at RMIT. Dr Narongchai has a house in Melbourne and a great affection for Australia&mdash;something that we struck throughout our visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we asked him about Bangkok traffic he was quite blunt in saying to the delegation that no English words were adequate to describe it. I think that that summed up the frustration. He went on to say that the only certainty he had was that it would get worse. It is something that Australian businesses that have some expertise in these sorts of things can assist with. Efforts are being made to put public transport systems in place but, given the way that the city of Bangkok has developed, that is going to be a very difficult thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand made a very brave prediction that the traffic problems in Bangkok would be solved within six months. Some of the English-Thai papers are running what they call `Mr Thaksin's clock', because they are monitoring the progress, time for which is running out, over the six-month period. Given what we observed, I do not like his chances of being successful. But Thais have to tackle the problem to increase their standing and ability to attract international business, because it is currently seen as an impediment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England mentioned to me after his contribution that he would have liked to have made some remarks about the recent floods in Thailand. I think that we all express our sympathy to those that were involved. One of the problems for Bangkok is that it is built alongside a tidal river and is always under a degree of threat. When we were in Thailand, there was flooding in the mid-region provinces, which meant that we had a problem of land transport at one stage in our visit. Given the nature of the river systems of Thailand and the peninsula, it is another problem that will always be with Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flooding problem is illustrative of the environmental problems that have to be confronted. The government has tried to tackle the problem of forests, which has led to a tightening up on the use of the forests but has in turn brought tension into the relationship across the Burmese border, for instance, where some of the logging companies have moved in. I know that it is quite appropriate that two reports, one on Thailand and the other on human rights in Myanmar, should be being debated at the same time because the Thai government does have to tackle its relationship with Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining few minutes, I would like to mention our visit to the displaced persons camp on the Burmese border, a camp that is run under the auspices of the BBC&mdash;the Burmese Border Consortium&mdash;which is a collection of non-government agencies that work with refugees. These displaced people do not have refugee status, only because the Thai government has not entered into the relevant international agreement. Again, the committee's report is quite correct in urging that moves be made to give assistance to the Thais to come to grips with their ability to sign that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The camp we visited was a very efficiently run camp, but the sad thing was that it has been in existence for 11 years. We were entertained by form 5 students who had had all their education in the camp. Because they had attained year 11 level, that was as far as their education was going to go. There was no other form of education available to them. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, because these people are not seeking resettlement in Thailand or anywhere else. They fervently want the ability to return to Burma, and to return to a Burma that would allow them to exist in the way they had done previously and to retain their ethnic identity. The people we visited were the Karen, and all they want is the ability to return to Burma and to get on with their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difficulty in the way the relationship between Thailand and Burma has developed, in that the Thais see an economic advantage. Perhaps they are skirting some of the issues that they really need to talk through to ensure that people such as those we were able to visit in the camps are able to return to Burma and do what they want to do. They want to get on with life in their part of Myanmar and retain their identity. I congratulate all those associated with this report. It is a very useful document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I was not a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade subcommittee that has produced the report on human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma; but, from my reading of it, it is fair to say that it certainly covers the spectrum of issues. I want to record my appreciation of the work that has gone into this particular report, which covers the very clear central role of ethnic minority issues and the fact that, since the assassination of Aung San in 1948, the promise of Burma's being able to develop a system of confederations amongst the various Chin, Shan and Karen and Karenni people has disappeared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties of Burma are very much associated with the belief that the only way that Burma could survive as a nation was through a very crucial role for the armed forces. This is one of the excuses that the Burmese military establishment has utilised in the decades since. It says that it is threatened by insurrection, by guerilla forces and, at one stage, by the Communist Party of Burma and the various aligned minority groups. The assassination of Aung San, the father of the current internationally acclaimed human rights leader, was a crucial factor in the spiral that has occurred since 1948, and the report very much deals with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment on page (xiii) of the report&mdash;that reality `requires the perpetrators of abuses to be brought to justice, the establishment of an independent judiciary and a free press, a recognition of the rights of a democratic opposition and the subordination of the army to an elected civilian government'&mdash;really does summarise what should be sought here. Since the 1988 crackdown, the arrest and imprisonment of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the assumption of power by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC, as it is known, and the incarceration and torture of members and supporters of the National League for Democracy&mdash;which in 1990, of course, obtained over 80 per cent of the vote in democratic elections&mdash;the international focus has certainly been on this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on Thailand that we debated earlier dealt with one of the other aspects of this matter&mdash;the fact that ASEAN countries perhaps do not have the same stress on human rights that we have. It is something that cannot be run away from, it is something that must be acknowledged and that we must work with. I note that in this report, and I think it has bipartisan support, there are certain benchmarks that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has indicated should be the guidelines for any kind of assessment of progress. It is all right to talk about constructive engagement and about progress that has been made. But, in reality, as we have been seeing in the newspapers in the last week, it really is not that patently obvious that progress has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had in the last week threats to the released leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. We have had very important announcements by a number of veterans of the independence struggle who have clearly identified themselves with the opposition and the need for further progress. We have had indications that the views of the opposition will not be given much consideration in the current movement towards a supposed constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, as I say, goes to a few of the absolutely axiomatic issues in this matter. It says essentially that Australia must play a fairly important role in this region. It says that constructive engagement must be treated with care and that it should not be able to be manipulated by the Myanmar authorities. It looks at the disturbingly up-beat tempo of investment in the country and the reality that under the guise of this so-called constructive engagement there has been a fairly rapid growth of investment. Obviously that means that corporations of diverse nature start to have a vested interest in associations with the government and complicity in its future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Table 6.4 in the report cites that investment growth has gone from $618 million in 1989 to just under $3 billion in 1995. The report also details the major countries that have been making that investment. In 1994-95, the United Kingdom led the way, followed by France, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. So there has been a steady growth in investment and it is occurring in a country that has very disturbing conditions. To cite a few of the views that have been put forward, Amnesty International in November 1994 stated there had been no fundamental change and that the government had reinforced its repressive hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the US State Department stated that there was a pervasive security apparatus, selective restrictions on contact with foreigners, surveillance of government employees and private citizens and, in summary, harassment, oppression, detention and intimidation. Freedom House, in its assessment of countries around the world, gave it the lowest of its seven rankings. And in March 1995, Human Rights Watch/Asia, a creditable international monitor of human rights, spoke of the continued abuses across the country, forced portering&mdash;in other words, forced labour to help the armed forces&mdash;and reprisals against the civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been the forced relocation of between 500,000 and 1 million people. The Special Rapporteur for the United Nations has continued to expose the forced relocations from Yangon, Mandalay and Yan-bye. He has also detailed not only the very obvious restrictions and suppression of political activists but also these other facets of the country: forced labour, forced relocation and basic harassment of ethnic minorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burma Action Group in evidence before the committee specifically spoke of between 120,000 and 150,000 people being forced to work on the Ye-Tavoy railway, half a million people being forced to give three days a month for the restoration of the moat and the palace, 360,000 people compelled to labour on the Myangyan-Nahtogyi railway, and another 350,000 compelled to give their services for the Bassein Airport. There has also been a very big focus on the planned $1 billion gas link project involving the French company Total and the US company Unocal. The situation there has been that people along the route of that project have been moved from their houses and compelled to work on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread use of prison labour throughout the country and, in the same manner as the virtually simultaneous report on Thailand talks about labour conditions, a number of bodies have exposed the Myanmar government's very strong complicity in extremely poor international labour conditions. This report talks, on page 135 and afterwards, about an ILO report of the Committee of Freedom of Association and details specifically the activities of Myanmar's ambassador to the United States, other diplomatic representatives of that government and its own labour registration bodies in some cases, and, in one notorious case, kidnapping Burmese seamen who had complained about conditions. It details the very widespread international use of Burmese seamen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the report talks about the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS>, a Maltese flagship. On page 136, at point 92, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their December salary was paid three months late and minus overtime. Thereafter they only received cash advances representing a fraction of their true entitlement. Living conditions on board were appalling&mdash;they were rationed to only 15 minutes of fresh water for washing and bathing every five days, and were supplied with the barest minimum food to survive. Only 2.5 kg of meat were spread between 22 Myanmar crew. The rice was not full grain but the type usually used to feed livestock rather than humans. The men had serious worries about the overall safety of the ship. There was only one nine-year-old radio receiver working and the medical chest was almost empty in breach of international standards.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trans Dignity</EMPHASIS>, the report spoke of the activities of the Myanmar government once those workers had returned to Myanmar. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . their passports and seamen's books were confiscated by the Myanmar authorities as punishment for accepting the help of the ITF&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the International Transport Federation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and refusing to hand over their back pay settlements.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not only the crude excesses of the military, their complicity in regard to prostitution in Thailand, their complicity in environmental destruction and their total control of large sectors of the economy; it is also that on the international front they are providing cheap labour, particularly in the transport shipping field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have had diplomats around the world&mdash;and this statement is supported unanimously by the committee, which has itemised and exposed this, and by other international organisations&mdash;who have become involved in supporting these shipping companies when employees have complained about conditions. They have been involved in extracting any wages that were recovered, and they have seized people's work permits. Quite frankly, a number of people who returned to Myanmar have not been heard of since by international unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national convention, of course, has been pumped up as an indicator of the people's say in the process towards a new constitution. It is worth noting that, as of 9 January this year, of the 702 delegates, 550 managed to be selected by SLORC and, in reality, only one in seven were representative in any democratic sense. So this process towards a new constitution, this alleged movement towards democracy or some kind of progress on that front, is a total sham, essentially for international coverage. At 4.76 this committee says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Burmese regime is a source of instability in the region. Its lack of accountability and legitimacy allows for corruption and oppression; there is no forum, independent of the government, to bring to account, consistently and impartially, those who, through normal human venality, abuse and oppress their fellow citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not only a problem internally for its people, it is a force of instability in the region. Of course, there have been concerns expressed by our diplomatic representatives, our foreign minister and by members on both sides of this House, about the degree of interaction&mdash;one might even go as far as `complicity'&mdash;by a number of ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report clearly reiterates the failure of the Burmese to sign a large number of important international conventions. The fact that they did not sign them shows their obvious unwillingness to adhere to these conditions. The committee states that the performance of the Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, at the United Nations in October 1994 was characterised by equivocation and contradiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report reasserts the Australian perspective that the rights articulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are universal, inalienable and indivisible. The arguments by the Myanmar authorities that they essentially have a Myanmar way, that there is a difference, and that they do not adhere to Western values, has fundamentally been rejected unanimously by this committee. This committee clearly asserts that there are no distinctions by creed, race or state of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this committee has come down with a report that hits at the issues. It says that we cannot sit back, we cannot worry too much about our associations with some Asian countries that might not be as forthright. Finally, at paragraph 5.12 of the report, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many authoritarian governments wish to appear in the forefront of modern progress but are reluctant to institute genuine change. Such governments tend to claim that they are taking a uniquely national or indigenous path towards a political system in keeping with the times . . . It is often in the name of cultural integrity as well as social stability and national security that democratic reforms based on human rights are resisted by the authoritarian governments . . . It is claimed, usually without adequate evidence, that democratic values and human rights run counter to the national culture, and therefore to be beneficial they need to be modified&mdash;perhaps to the extent that they are barely recognisable.</PARA>
<PARA>She also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nation may choose a system that leaves the protection of the freedom and security of the many dependent on the few; or it may choose institutions and practices that will sufficiently empower individuals and organisations to protect their own freedom and security.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two decades after its passage through this parliament, the Family Law Act continues to be perceived as something which marked a turning point in family composition and interpersonal relations in Australia. Was it the important reform which Lionel Murphy claimed a decade after its passage, or was it a measure that transformed marriage into licensed cohabitation from which any party has the right to withdraw at will?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These questions have been debated for the last two decades and, no doubt, will continue to be debated. In many respects this parliament over that period of time has addressed those questions through a series of inquiries. A major inquiry was that of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, which reported in 1980. A more recent inquiry was that of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which operated in the previous parliament and in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS> is the third report of the current joint select committee. Much of the report deals with resourcing and administration of the Family Court and the structure of it. In short, the committee concluded that the court is sufficiently resourced, but could be more efficiently conducted. The committee also proposed a reordering of the management structure of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of funding, the court has been operating in a running cost environment since 1989-90. In the last financial year the net cost of services of the Family Court was $97.3 million, with a running cost budget in 1995-96 of approximately $67 million. The nominal Family Court running cost allocations from 1989-90 to 1994-95 have increased by 50.7 per cent with an average annual increase of 8.5 per cent. The real percentage increases over the same period are 36.8 per cent with an average annual increase of 6.5 per cent. The expenditure increases for the total nominal cost of the Family Court, which include property operating costs, for the same period are 70.9 per cent with an average annual increase of 11.3 per cent. The real percentage increase is 55.2 per cent with an average annual increase of 9.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee came to the conclusion that the court is adequately funded and that any changes in circumstances which may have an effect on its workload and may require additional funding should be negotiated with the Department of Finance. We were aware that the Family Court has a complex and difficult task but ultimately recognised that the court, like other budget funded agencies, must manage in the best way it can with the resources it has available. The committee does not approve of the Family Court's past record of overspending and its inappropriate management practice of utilising the facility of borrowing against future needs. The facility for borrowing funds should be used only in exceptional circumstances and should not be adopted as a normal management practice. Continual borrowing is analogous to a person living on their bankcard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the matter more generally, the committee believes that the court would benefit from an in-depth outside evaluation of its management and financial practices, with its internal records open to full scrutiny. We have recommended that this should be done by the Auditor-General by way of an efficiency audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the management of the court, the committee does not believe the responsibility for the management and administration should be solely vested in the Chief Justice, who is assisted by the chief executive officer. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the responsibility for the management and administration of the court should be vested in a collegiate body of judges of the Family Court and expressed through the rules of the court. The existing management structure of the court is unnecessarily complex and is not the optimum structure for the court. The complexity and duplication of functions lead to unnecessary expense, particularly in the form of travel and conferences. The complex matrix of management should be replaced by a centralised management structure utilising effective local regional personal management rather than the present top-heavy bureaucratic structure which is employed by the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came to the conclusion that the Family Court is operating like a department of state rather than like a court. The court should be stripped of its bureaucratic and administrative layers and complexities. It should abolish its regional management and establish its principal office in Canberra. These are, of course, far-reaching recommendations so far as the structure is concerned. This was a unanimous report of the committee and we hope the recommendations are taken on board by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning more broadly to the issues of family law, it is sometimes said that when an idea has gained general acceptance its time has passed. One limitation of the current inquiry, indeed of the act itself, is the concentration on rights without a corresponding emphasis on responsibilities. In particular, the emphasis remains on the rights of parties&mdash;that is, the rights of adults&mdash;to end a marriage. Yet research increasingly indicates that children can be the victims of the cultural change which occurred either because of or related to the passage of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Exeter family study in Britain challenged the assumption that children do not suffer greatly from divorce when it noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previous studies have strongly suggested that it is parental conflict rather than their actual separation that is associated with poor outcomes for children following divorce. This has led some commentators to suggest that it is better to resolve a high conflict situation by ending the parental relationship than by allowing it to continue. This view, while not being widely promoted, has gained some credence as `accepted wisdom', and, indeed, many of the Exeter families who had divorced believed that their decision was in the best interest of the children as well as themselves. Data from this study provides some evidence that such a `justification' for divorce may be a misunderstanding of the reality.</PARA>
<PARA>The authors went on to say in their conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings from this pilot study indicate that although <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">most</EMPHASIS> children do not exhibit acute difficulties beyond the initial stage of family breakdown <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">a significant minority</EMPHASIS> of children encounter long-term problems. Compared with their matched pairs in intact families, children who had experienced their parents' divorce were more likely to report problems in key areas of their lives, including psychosomatic disorders, difficulties with school work and low sense of self-esteem. They were more likely to feel confused and uninvolved in arrangements about their future and to have lasting feelings of concern about both their resident and non-resident parents. Parental conflict and financial difficulties are clearly important features of family reorganisation that are associated with adverse outcomes for children. However, in this study it appeared that a more important adverse factor was the loss of a parent and the consequences, which included the risk that history would repeat itself with the breakdown of subsequent parental relationships.</PARA>
<PARA>That study reinforced work that had been carried out over a period of years, particularly by Judith Wallerstein in the United States of America, and therefore challenged some of the assumptions that underlie the legislation itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Michael Duffy, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> wrote recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible that children have been the great losers of the social changes of the past 30 years and that, as women were oppressed by patriarchal society, children are oppressed by the new order.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently, the Chief Executive Officer of the Family Court, Mr Glare, said that Lionel Murphy's vision of the court was flawed and naive. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thesis of it was the friendly, helpful, caring court and taking the fault out of it to get rid of bitterness. The fact is it doesn't, and the fact that they can't have a court blame one partner or other often creates a great deal of bitterness.</PARA>
<PARA>I recall that when the Family Law Act was enacted it was established on two pillars, those two pillars being one of rights and the other of responsibilities. The rights pillar is the right of a party to say, on the evidence of 12 months separation, that the marriage had ended and therefore they had the right to be able to walk away or to leave or to end that marriage. The other pillar is the responsibility which is set out in section 43 of the act to somehow seek to enhance family life and marriage itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the late Lionel Murphy, in his second reading speech, made reference to this pillar of the Family Law Act when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are important provisions in the Bill for helping persons who contemplate, or have begun, proceedings under the Bill to achieve a reconciliation where possible, and for helping persons for whom a reconciliation is not possible to resolve their differences with the minimum bitterness and hostility. The reconciliation provisions extend to all proceedings under the Bill, not just divorce proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at the other speeches at the time by various members of parliament from both sides of the chamber, it was quite clear that one of the pillars upon which the Family Law Act was established by this parliament was that of responsibilities, not simply the pillar of rights. But, two decades after the introduction of the act, only one pillar, the one relating to rights, the one relating to the divorce of the parties, remains effectively as the operational basis of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The neglect of reconciliation in particular has been something which has been commented upon from time to time. As long ago as 1982, a New South Wales judge described a section of the legislation supporting marriage as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . propaganda contradicted by the substantial provisions of the act.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaking in 1991, the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Justice Nicholson, conceded the failure of the supportive provision when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Originally it was thought that the court would play a role in the promotion of reconciliation, but the experience of the past 15 years has been that by the time that a couple approaches the court, there is little room for reconciliation, and such reconciliations that do occur are of uncertain and doubtful duration.</PARA>
<PARA>It is against that background that the committee has made some recommendations in relation to counselling, to alternate dispute resolution and to mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, basically, is of the view that the services of the Family Court, given the history of the past 20 years, should be reduced to its core judicial functions and that alternate dispute resolution, including mediation, should be pursued in the family law area in a community based program, or series of programs, rather than through the Family Court structure itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a provision in the act which provides some statutory requirement on the court to provide reconciliation. Given that that has not occurred, and it has been conceded by the court that that has not occurred, we have said that the legislation should quite clearly put that within the realm of various community agencies&mdash;the family life movement, Relationships Australia, et cetera&mdash;so that, with proper funding, they can pursue that. With respect to the conciliation counselling that is provided in the court&mdash;that is, counselling that is aimed at enabling the parties to achieve a divorce with less bitterness than might otherwise be the case&mdash;we suggest that that counselling, where possible, should be directed to agencies outside the court itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these measures would mean that the pure judicial functions that exist under the legislation would be retained by the Family Court. I refer to the things which were thought of as being important 20 years ago&mdash;namely, the responsibilities pillar. That pillar can be seen in terms of support for marriage and relationships, in terms of trying to enable people to enter into relationships on a better footing and, if there are difficulties in those relationships, to be able to resolve them with a view to trying to strengthen the relationship. That responsibilities pillar of the Family Law Act should be separated entirely in terms of the legislation. In that way, it can be given the degree of importance, the degree of support and the degree of funding which is desirable in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hardly needs to repeat that there are various ways of measuring divorce in the community but it is generally accepted that the rate of divorce has increased about threefold over the past 20 years, and that the chances of a marriage succeeding have been reduced to about six in 10, over the lifetime of a marriage. If you look at a period of 25 to 30 years then it is expected that four in 10 Australian marriages will break down. Given that that comes at a cost of some $3,000 million a year to this community, it is something that this parliament ought properly have in consideration&mdash;and so, too, should the community. This will not be the last word on the Family Law Act. There will need to be some ongoing reviews of it because it is such an important matter for society and for individuals. I commend this report to all members and to the government. I hope that some of the recommendations are taken up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to compliment the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) who took over as Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues late in the committee's consideration of this report. I can only be very complimentary about all of the skills that he brought to bear as chairman of the committee. He certainly has a much less iconoclastic approach to matters than I do and I am sure that the committee members were very grateful for that. I would also like to compliment my friend and colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) for his contribution to the committee. He has brought to the committee a longstanding interest and expertise, particularly his focus on trying to bring in prevention at a much earlier stage than currently, regarding government dollars. I understand that I am to be followed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), for whom I have an equal regard. I have appreciated always his patient explanations of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say from the outset that, in a negative sense, this report does not go far enough for my liking. But, having said that, I think this is a very good report. I think it starts the platform of further reform in the Family Court area and I would urge all honourable members to read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it regrettable that this was always only intended to be a cameo report which briefly trailed over the information systems of the Family Court and gave yes or no answers to funding needs. For that reason, the committee really did not benefit from great public input as it had in its two earlier reports, the icebreaking report under Senator Jim McKiernan and the report in the child support area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, this is an excellent report. I congratulate and thank all the acting secretaries of this parliamentary committee: Robina Mills, Claressa Surtees, David Wallace, Matthew Mason-Cox and, of course, Jane Vincent, who is away on leave. At various stages, these people acted as the secretary to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies concluded by saying that this will not be the last look at family law, and I agree with him 100 per cent. However, I am not disappointed that the select committee is, in a sense, winding up. I believe that there is a need, certainly in the next parliament, to look at the community sector: how it operates and whether or not there are ways in which we can strengthen its effectiveness, notwithstanding the recommendations to increase its role that are contained in this report. I sincerely hope that there will be sufficient members around in the new parliament who would be so motivated to want to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family law area needs constant monitoring and finetuning, if not change. I will be very blunt. I think the Family Court expected quite a number of things to come out of this report, not the least of which was the call for increased funding. We have actually rejected all those aspirations that the court may have had. We reject the call for extra funding. We state that the court is adequately resourced. We reject the call for extra jurisdiction and, indeed, we break down the monopoly position of the Family Court in family law matters. We reject any call for more judges and we actually propose that extrajudicial registrars should be provided from within the existing judicial positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We strip the court of its dormant function of reconciliation or pro-active counselling. We can debate whether the court was adequately funded to fulfil this important role when it was set up 20 years ago. The truth of the matter is that, in 20 years, it has never allocated a priority to it. It is about time the parliament faced up to the issue that the court is not going to pick up this function. Yet this function is vitally important. We also attempt to strip or realign the power of the Chief Justice by recommending a more collegiate form of management for the court, which I am convinced will serve the court well in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to discuss this touchy issue of reconciliation or pro-active counselling. The chief executive officer has appeared before the committee. He stated that the court does very well and that only five per cent of all cases that come before the court actually lead to a case before a judge in the court. This is a most deceptive argument, because it ignores the fact that many people get frustrated along the way and run out of money after having to spend awful amounts. There would not be a single member of the committee who did not think that we would be a lot better off if even just a portion of the money spent on private legal expenses were actually allocated to the children of these broken relationships and marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the record that I do not accept this five per cent figure as some justification for excellence in the court. I reject the proposition that breakdown will always be so traumatic and so emotional that we cannot do very much better. This is where I think reconciliation and pro-active counselling comes into play. At the very best, it will save some relationships; it will save some marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem, in my view, is that we come up against some prevailing male taboos in that males are very reluctant to undergo counselling. We have to break down those taboos. Even where we do not actually save marriages&mdash;and it will always be the case that some relationships, some marriages, break down&mdash;we need to increase dramatically, in those that do break down and are dissolved, the degree of dignity of the partners, a regard for getting on with their own new lives, and particularly an acceptance of responsibility for any children in the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely disappointing that so much government money is focused on the terminal end of relationships and marriages and so little is up front. Again I pay tribute to the honourable member for Menzies, who has always had a consistent attitude to that. By the committee saying that pro-active or reconciliation counselling should be a function placed in the community sector and funded accordingly, we are for the first time as a parliament really doing something very serious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other people have mentioned what really is the maladministration of the resources of the court: the lack of priority setting; the inability to come to grips with cost-benefit studies and apply that methodology to funding initiatives; the fact that new initiatives have been embraced without a commitment from the Attorney-General's Department or the Department of Finance to finance them; spending up the allocation of the court consistently so that each year it lives on its bankcard; and, last but not least, the reception of money from the Justice Statement such that it bailed the Family Court out of serious financial difficulties. These are all contained in the report, and I think they need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly welcome the statement of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) that he has already commenced to pick up the recommendation about having the Australian National Audit Office go through the Family Court. I hope the court and the Minister for Justice pick up the other recommendations as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address a couple of other issues. Firstly, the independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of our democracy. In countries where this does not operate, the low quality of life and the lack of human rights are, unfortunately, the consequence. I think all members of parliament would wish to maintain and support the independence of the judiciary, but I am not convinced, at this stage, that transferring financial responsibility away from the Attorney-General's Department to the courts for administration is an aspect of this independence of the judiciary. I have an open mind about whether it should stay there or whether it may be better to return that function to the courts. It is something for the Family Court, in particular, to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I want to raise is the fact that under the act the media are not allowed to report cases of the Family Court which would identify the parties. We took evidence in Western Australia that the import of that section of the act meant that it is almost impossible for the media to report cases which come before the Family Court. This has had a very unfortunate consequence because in no other court, with the exception of the Children's Court, is a court free from the glare and accountability that is associated with media reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others may say that they will report the sensational cases. That is true. Politicians could be victims of that. That is true. The court is a pressure cooker for a lot of the dissatisfaction that ordinary people have had&mdash;and, indeed, some learned people from the law have had&mdash;about the way the court operates. In a democracy it is not a good thing that we have such an act on our statute books. In any other court, applicants before the court can always put a case to the judge, based on merit, about whether or not names should be suppressed. I have sufficient confidence in the judiciary to suggest that I am quite happy to leave that discretion. We do not pick that up in the report. I just signal my dissatisfaction that we have not, and I hope it will be addressed later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I have already apologised for but I reiterate was that during the child support inquiry we got a lot of complaints about the issue of access, which is now called contact. I had always said that we would try to pick this up in the report. We have failed to do so. Many people will feel let down and I sincerely apologise for that. There is a great interest among members on both sides of parliament in the operation of the family law area. I am sure that they will be monitoring the implementation of reports, how well and effective they are and whether or not they are making a real difference. I hope in the future, if there is still the need, that issue will be picked up. I commend the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Family law is a very important issue in the community and although the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Certain Family Law Issues entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS> will not be a best-seller, it may have greater significance in the future than meets the eye.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preparation of the report was undertaken under what I regard as less than ideal conditions. The committee established in the 36th parliament, that is, the parliament which sat between 1991 and 1993, had this subject committed to it but, because of the width of the reference that was given to it to review the whole of the Family Law Act, this part was hived off and saved for a later report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee commenced the hearing of evidence in November 1992 at the end of the term of the parliament and at a time when an election was imminent. When the committee was reconstituted in this parliament it was given the task of investigating the Child Support Agency, and the funding and administration provisions of the Family Law Act that had been saved from the previous reference were postponed until the completion of the CSA report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSA report was a major job. It contained something like 160 different recommendations and took many months. There were thousands of contacts with people in the community regarding the subject matter and the report took a great deal of time in its settling. It is not unfair to say that the committee members were somewhat burnt out by the time it was completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee then turned its attention to this report, and even then there were problems. The member for Chifley (Mr Price), who spoke before me, was, at this time, chairman of the committee. Mr Price made a speech on 1 May this year which attracted the ire of the Chief Justice of the Family Court&mdash;I will say something about this in a minute&mdash;and caused some consternation among committee members. There was a lack of continuity in the secretariat staff in the latter stages of the committee's work. The chairman changed in June and the report was put together, I believe, in something of a rush at the end of this parliament. The circumstances were not ideal and, no doubt, the report could have been improved by a more focused and regular form of inquiry. However, there is a report and it should be considered on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court is basically a trial court and it has registries and courtrooms across the country. There are great difficulties in administering a court which has to exist under these sorts of arrangements. In the 1995-96 budget, the Family Court has an amount of $100 million budgeted for it, which is a very substantial sum. By way of comparison, the Federal Court of Australia&mdash;which, similarly, is basically a trial court and has registries and courtrooms across the country&mdash;has a budget of $37 million. There are nothing like three times the number of judges in the Family Court as there are in the Federal Court, which, of itself, raises a question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court has grown since it was established about 20 years ago and, in the course of this growth, a significant number of questions have arisen. These questions are to some extent for government and to some extent for the court to address. The questions are only partly addressed in the report. It is entirely appropriate for the government to ask why such a substantial sum is spent by the community in the resolution of the breakdown of marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be borne in mind in this context that the expenditure on the court is only a small part of the total cost of family breakdown within the community. The amount of public funds spent in the community for preparation of people for marriage and for support of the institution of marriage is minuscule by comparison. Even if one adds into this context relationships where there is no marriage but where there is a stable relationship, the amount of money spent is fractional in comparison to the money spent on marriage breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues does not answer this question and, to this point, there has been no answer forthcoming from the government. There is a token recognition of the disparity in the government's recent Justice Statement, but this goes nowhere towards answering criticism which, I believe, is quite proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question for both the court and the government to ask is why the Family Court has grown so much and why its activities are extending into areas which do not appear to involve the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. I am referring here not only to counselling&mdash;which seems to be a large part of the court's activities&mdash;but also to the various alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. The report points to a need to move some of these activities away from the court and back into the community. However, I regard the examination of these issues as only preliminary. The court itself appears to be not at all concerned that it is ceasing more and more to look like a court and that it is becoming, in appearance, more and more like an organ of the executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the geographic spread of the court's facilities, it is appropriate to ask what the proper management structure is for the court. The report gives the committee's response to that, suggesting that the current regional arrangements are not the best alternative and that the traditional model of administration of the court, where the administration responsibility is vested in the college of judges itself, is more appropriate than the present scheme whereby it is vested solely in the Chief Justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That suggestion is not in any sense a direct criticism of the Chief Justice but, as a matter of principle, there are very good reasons which have been articulated by the current Governor of Victoria, the Hon. Richard McGarvie, as to why the college of judges rather than a single member of the court should be the body responsible for administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the relatively new system of a one-line budget and the court having responsibility for its own administration, difficult issues arise as to the extent to which the government should intrude in the administration of the court and as to the means by which the court should be accountable to the public for the quality of its management. The report raises this question and proffers some comment on the issues but it does not provide a complete answer. That is a subject that I think needs further analysis, probably not only in relation to the Family Court but in relation to all courts having a one-line budget arrangement. I know that the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration has a particular interest in this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the member for Chifley had made a speech on 1 May on which the Chief Justice had commented. The member for Chifley knows, because I have told him, that I was going to say that I do not agree with the course of action he took. In his speech he was highly critical of the court in circumstances where I believe it was inevitable that the media would hear of what he said. He gave the appearance in my mind of having prejudged some of the issues that were before the court and he generated, I believe inevitably, a loss of confidence by the court that the committee would undertake its inquiry in a fair and objective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that in respect of the member for Chifley, I have some comments also on the response that was evoked. The Chief Justice wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I think the letter was made available publicly. It has certainly been referred to extensively by the member for Chifley in a speech he gave in the House on 28 November in the context of the second reading of the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. I regard the response of the Chief Justice as inappropriate. It was intemperate in its own terms and, I believe, brought the court and the Chief Justice right into the political arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this age when the members of the judiciary are subjected to close scrutiny and unrestrained&mdash;and sometimes irresponsible&mdash;public criticism, it is very important that the court is appropriately defended publicly, particularly against unjustified invective. In the absence of action on the part of the Attorney-General or the legal profession in defending the court, I believe the court should defend itself publicly. But when a response comes from the court, that response should be compatible with judicial independence and objectivity and the maintenance of confidence by the community in the judicial system. The community must be confident that, in coming to court, they will get a fair, impartial, objective hearing and a just result. There is a serious risk of the loss of that respect and confidence if the sort of response that emanates from the court to public criticism is of the sort that one would expect to find in the political bearpit rather than by way of a dignified retort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think that the problem was largely resolved by the promotion of the member for Chifley to the chairmanship of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the replacement of him as chairman by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who, I must say, very quickly got on top of the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, let me say that, from my point of view, the report is not a blueprint. It does expose some community concerns and particularly some concerns felt by members of the committee as to the funding and administration of the court and it gives some pointers, some directions, for future reform. But I really regard it at this stage as a preliminary examination of what are in many cases very difficult issues. I look forward to this being regarded as only a first step. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to express my thanks to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) for having laid down this report on the 35th conference of the South Pacific Commission in Noumea. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and I were members of a parliamentary delegation that visited, with the minister, the South Pacific Commission and participated in its deliberations. Then separately&mdash;although the minister also visited Fiji&mdash;the honourable member for Macarthur and I visited Fiji from 28 October to 1 November. Our visit to the South Pacific Commission from 25 October to 27 October was really more as part of a parliamentary representation to the commission. There are a couple of aspects on that that I want to address briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that it is many years since I last attended a South Pacific Commission. The South Pacific Forum has adopted a much higher profile in recent years and it has become very much the body around which political debate takes place. On the last occasion when I attended a South Pacific Commission, it was there that countries such as Fiji and other members discussed quite significant issues that affected the future development of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, it was apparent that the South Pacific Commission has become far more oriented to aid and to the development of economic opportunities within the region. For that reason, I found it particularly interesting meeting those Australians who have been attached to the South Pacific Commission and to learn from those who are in our mission to Noumea&mdash;particularly the Consul-General, Graham Wilson, the vice-consuls and others&mdash;something of the Australian operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have little doubt that a body such as the South Pacific Commission has a continued role. I wondered, after the establishment of the South Pacific Forum, whether perhaps the days of the commission might be finite, but I see a great advantage in having a South Pacific Commission which is able to debate and collate technical assistance for Pacific island countries and contribute to their economic and social development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our particular visit coincided with the election processes for the top three positions in the South Pacific Commission: the Secretary-General and the directors of programs and services. I was very pleased that Australia decided to field a candidate with whom I have been associated for many years, Dr Bob Dun. I first knew Bob Dun when he worked as a veterinarian at the Trangie Research Station of the New South Wales department of agriculture. That was in the days when, as a young lawyer, I decided to become a farmer. I remember going to courses in genetics at the UNE and going around trying to learn. At the time the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and I were both involved in the University of New England. Bob Dun was one of those young vets who was able to help me considerably in understanding why, if you joined an Angus to a Hereford, the progeny had white faces, and matters of that ilk. Bob Dun subsequently did his doctor of veterinary science degree and is now one of the world's leading geneticists, quite apart from the experience he has had in AusAID in administering the Australian aid program and elsewhere. It was he who was selected to be the Australian candidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election was quite an interesting process, and I confess that there were times when we wondered just how the vote would eventuate. It went through a series of negotiations before the actual ballot and then, on the day, there were two other candidates contending for the position. In any event, Dr Dun was successful. The other two candidates, one from New Zealand and one from Fiji, no doubt had their merits; but, from Australia's point of view, as a major contributor to the South Pacific Commission, it was important to have somebody with the background and experience of Dr Dun to ensure that the whole of the development of the South Pacific Commission aid program and administration retained both conformity with other similar organisations and the ability to use its not insignificant funds to best advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The positions of director of programs and director of services were filled by very capable candidates, too, from the Solomon Islands and Guam, respectively. I think it is going to be very interesting to see how the SPC performs in its new format. I certainly see that the budget subcommittee and some of the budget analysis that we discussed at the commission will help to ensure that there is better use made of the funds spent. In its magnificent new `upturned canoe' venue in Noumea, there is no doubt that it is an organisation which is well housed and is now being well administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One trusts that the SPC can help the development of the South Pacific nations, which do have great challenges. Many of them are monocultural states with economies based on coconut and fishing or copra and fishing, and it is very hard for them to diversify to any degree. It is particularly important when nations such Australia and France&mdash;which is another major contributor in this region&mdash;allocate so much to the aid programs that they should be well administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one real disappointment I had at the SPC meeting was that Britain is withdrawing. Britain has made successive major blunders in its handling of affairs in our part of the world. This is too narrow a debate to enable me to develop the point but, since Britain took the policy years ago to withdrew east of Suez, it has progressively pulled out of a region where it has enormous financial investments. I find it quite paradoxical that, at a time when Britain is pulling out of Hong Kong&mdash;in 1997, of course, China resumes control of that colony&mdash;we are going into a phase where Britain is going to be represented in the South Pacific Commission by its residual colony in the Pacific, Pitcairn Island, which has all of 84 inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of anything more stupid than for Britain's ambassador in Fiji to attend next year's South Pacific Commission not to represent Britain but to represent Pitcairn. Britain does have a role. The South Pacific Commission benefits from having the United States represented at this forum by a very distinguished American. It is important that the European countries, who for so long have taken a great deal from their colonies in this region, should maintain a commitment to help these nations develop for the future; so I was very sorry that Britain was withdrawing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the South Pacific Commission enters the next year with a strong management team and, apart from the British withdrawal, the era ahead with Dr Bob Dun at the helm will be one of great interest and, I hope, of significant achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From there, the honourable member of Macarthur and I were members of a parliamentary delegation to Fiji. I wanted to say a little on that because it seemed to me that this was an appropriate way by which we could report to the parliament on developments in a country that has been very close to Australia, where many of us worry about constitutional evolution, where the processes of democracy are not necessarily seen as we see them, and where the Rabuka `revolution' of some years ago caused a great deal of angst in Australia&mdash;and still causes worry&mdash;because of the extent to which it seemed to be based on a racial prejudice which, for all that one might have sympathies for the Fijian people, leaves a concern about the large number of people of Indian extraction who have contributed so much to the economic development of the island. Sugar is still very important there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our program started with our arrival at Nadi. We had lunch on the first day with the President of the Senate, Ratu Tu'uakitau, at the Fijian Hotel. From there we went to Suva where we met the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Jai Ram Reddy, a man with whom anyone who has met him could not but be impressed. But, as he said, the paradox of his position as leader of the opposition is that he can never be prime minister. That seems to be an extraordinary situation, where  the leader of the opposition in a parliamentary democracy&mdash;or a country that presumes to have a parliamentary democracy&mdash;cannot be prime minister. The challenge for Fiji is to develop a situation where they do accept the processes of parliament and the electoral system which allow whoever it might be to be the prime minister if they are elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following day in Suva we met a series of people at the Parliament House. We were escorted by Mr Victor Rigamoto, the Secretary-General of the Fijian parliament and my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur presented some books to the parliamentary library on behalf of the Australian parliament. Since our visit I have arranged through the Clerk of the House of Representatives to send a number of books on our procedures and practices to the parliament of Fiji. They are essentially interested in following our Westminster style traditions and one would hope that they can continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were hosted to a lunch by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr Kurusiqila, who was a very redoubtable rugby player in days gone by. In the afternoon we went down to meet Mark Halabe, who runs the Mark One Apparel garment factory. He is an Australian of some considerable success here who has a garment factory in Australia and in Fiji. He told us of some of the worries that he has, yet he did say that the productivity here was higher, although the costs were higher too. Mark has done a very good job, in my view, in the development of his factory there. The conditions for his work force were excellent and the stability was good. He deserves to be commended and I hope he continues to achieve economic success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following day we met Mahendra Chaudry, who is the General-Secretary of the Fiji Public Service Association and is another very distinguished Fijian. He is of Indian extraction and is the leader of the equivalent of our public service association. He was a very impressive man. Following that, we met the person I will always remember as being outstanding amongst those we met&mdash;Mrs Nazhat Shameen. She is a person, I suspect, of Sri Lankan extraction and is the Director of Public Prosecutions. She is a highly educated young lady, a brilliant lawyer, and we have offered her any assistance we can give to keep in contact with law development and processes here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She told us of a number of draft laws that she is developing to try to help the Attorney-General in the exercise of his function. Many of them relate to areas which are already legislated in Australia and I would hope that she could feel herself able to contact either her counterpart in Australia or, through the honourable member for Macarthur and me, the Australian Attorney-General's office so that we can help in the task of trying to ensure that the laws in Fiji are developed on lines that meet the general requirements of a changing community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were hosted to a lunch by Mr Greg Urwin, the Australian High Commissioner to Fiji. Mr Urwin has only recently taken up his post and he and his wife are doing an excellent job. I would like to particularly thank Mr Urwin and his staff. During the course of our visit we did have a great deal of assistance from officers in the Australian embassy and I would like thank each of them. Carl Ungerer was attached to us for most of our visit, and was very helpful in every way. Both the honourable member for Macarthur and I found that it was well worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relations with Fiji are important to Australia. It is sad that there is still doubt as to whether a true democratic government will be introduced after the constitutional commission has finished its process. That is a matter for the Fijians themselves to determine. I am sure that all members of this parliament would be prepared, on a bipartisan basis, to assist Fiji's evolution towards democracy, or the development of its laws. My wife, Rosemary, and I enjoyed the opportunity to again see a little of that wonderful country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a great pleasure for me to be part of the delegation representing Australia at the 35th South Pacific Conference and also, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said, to visit Fiji as part of an Australian parliamentary delegation. It was my first trip to the South Pacific. In more ways than one I found it to be very much a learning experience about the culture, the politics, the economics and the general dynamics of that particular region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for New England pointed out, we started out on the eve of the conference with the opening of the new building of the South Pacific Commission&mdash;as he described it, the `upturned canoe'. It is an impressive structure, built to take account of the climate and of local traditions. It is certainly an improvement on what they had before. In this case it was money well spent by the commission, although we have heard criticisms about other aspects of its management in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the reasons why Australia and New Zealand ran candidates for the secretary-generalship of the organisation. As the member for New England said, that particular election was an interesting process. I recall reading about it the week before in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald. </EMPHASIS>Australia thought that it would probably have the support of most countries to get our candidate, Dr Bob Dun, elected. There were reported to be some deals being done between New Zealand and England surrounding CHOGM and it was expected that it would be a very tight result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very interesting process. It was not quite like a ballot, as we know it, in Australian politics. It was a diplomatic exercise where it seemed that everyone was at pains to avoid at all costs an actual ballot on the floor of the conference. But because it was such a close contest, after a long-drawn out process of lobbying and an interesting form of diplomacy&mdash;one that I had never seen before&mdash;that is exactly what happened. There was a ballot on the floor of the conference, involving three candidates from Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an unforgettable couple of hours while this process was discussed. After a fairly close contest and a tense few hours, Dr Bob Dun was elected. I believe, as the right honourable member for New England said, that he will be an excellent choice as Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate our Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) for his efforts in representing Australia at that conference, and particularly for his lobbying efforts&mdash;along with the people from DFAT and AusAID&mdash;in securing Dr Dun's election. As I have said, it was a fascinating process, the like of which I had never seen. But more power to the people responsible; it was a pretty good lobbying exercise. Congratulations to the minister, and also to the various diplomats and public servants involved in securing that result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the officers from foreign affairs and AusAID. I also thank the consul general and his office in Noumea for their support and assistance. It was certainly a pleasant and successful trip to Noumea. There were no hitches and we were very well looked after by our hosts and those responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also went to Fiji. On the way there, unlike the honourable member for New England, I had the opportunity to visit Vanuatu for about four hours. I was on a different flight. Even though it was such a short visit, it was very pleasant and a bit of an eye-opener. I thank the High Commissioner of Vanuatu, Mr Peter Shannon, for his hospitality. I certainly enjoyed myself for those few hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We arrived at Nadi in Fiji. I did not really know a lot about Fiji, although, of course, I recall the Rabuka coup in 1987 and the overthrow of the democratically elected government. I was rather concerned when I learnt in more detail about the current constitution, its review process and its likely outcome. As we discovered, the constitution is now based on racial lines: the Prime Minister has to be an ethnic Fijian. As the honourable member for New England pointed out, the present leader of the opposition, Mr Reddy, is in that position by virtue of being the leader of the largest Indian based party in the parliament, but, of course, he cannot be Prime Minister. I think something is not quite right about a parliamentary system in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met Mr Reddy and the leader of the Fijian labour party, who, as the member for New England pointed out, is the president of the biggest public sector union, the Public Service Association. We had an interesting talk with both of those people. They lead the two major Indian based constituency political parties. In some ways, they were philosophical about the proposals. I got the feeling from our talk with these people, and with others, that they were not very optimistic about the likely outcome of the constitution or its effects. It is of some concern when one of our traditional near neighbours has a constitution based on racial lines, which results in clear divisions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern was Fiji's economy. Although Fiji is in a fertile part of the world with great economic potential, especially in agriculture, it is not living up to its potential. It relies on its sugar industry, which is still very much based on old technology with labour-intensive work practices. It relies on an agreement for preferential treatment with the European Union. That runs out in the year 2000 and Fiji might have some problems re-negotiating that agreement in this era of free trade and so-called level playing fields, et cetera. Fiji has the potential to do a lot more with its agricultural industries, and it is not doing it. This was an area that we commented on, and others commented to us about this, during our visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we met a number of people. I would like to thank the Australian Ambassador Dr Greg Urwin and his staff, particularly Mr Carl Ungerer, from the embassy in Fiji. We were also very well hosted by Mr Victor Rigamoto, who holds the position of Secretary-General of the Parliament, which I understand is a bit like our Clerk of the House of Representatives and Clerk of the Senate rolled into one&mdash;a bit of a Mr Fixit. It is a very powerful position in Fiji. I actually referred to him as the town clerk of Fiji because the role is almost like that of a general manager of a large council. He is obviously a very central figure in their administration and he is also a wonderful person and an excellent host. It was a pleasure to meet him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also met the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the member for New England pointed out, made a presentation to him and the President of the Senate, and invited them to visit Australia and our parliament in the near future. I know they have both been here in recent times and of course they are welcome back again. As the member for New England also pointed out, we met the Director of Public Prosecutions. That was a last minute-arrangement, but it was very interesting and I endorse the sentiments of the member for New England about Fiji's Director of Public Prosecutions. She is a very impressive young woman and one of probably not very many women in positions at the level in Fiji. Fiji's legal system is in good hands if people like her are around for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I was caught a bit short in having to make this speech. My notes are not here and I was given 10 minutes to get here. I had thought we would be discussing this this afternoon. Having said that, I would again like to thank all the people involved, including the member for New England, who was a very interesting and wonderful companion on the tour, along with his wife, Rosemary. I would also like to thank the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) and his staff, the staff of DFAT and AusAID, and the consul-general in Noumea and embassy staff in Fiji. I would also like to thank the High Commission in Vanuatu for the assistance provided on this trip. As I said, it was my first trip to the Pacific and, hopefully, not my last. It certainly was an eye-opener and a learning experience for me and I am very pleased to have taken part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak on this very fine report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Global change in Australia's overseas aid program</EMPHASIS> which is a ministerial policy paper and the 6th annual report to the parliament on Australia's development cooperation program. In what is possibly my last chance in the current parliament to speak on an issue, I welcome being able to speak on an issue that is very dear to my heart&mdash;that is, Australia's overseas aid program and how it fits into the changes taking place in our world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame, in a way, that such a valuable report is being debated in this place and that only two government members have the opportunity to discuss the vital issues raised in the report. Hopefully, those of us who return in the next parliament will take up many of the issues and they will be debated and followed through. As I said, it is my last chance to speak on this issue and it is pertinent that I relate where I am coming from, why I am involved in the whole issue of Australia's overseas aid program and how it impacts on people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember growing up in the era of church sponsored overseas aid, especially from the perspective of what the Presbyterian Church was doing, as my late father was a minister in the church. As a child I remember meeting missionaries from what seemed the far-flung areas of the Pacific Islands, China, Korea and many of the African countries, and hearing stories of life in those remote villages when those missionaries visited our churches and convinced people to contribute to the missionary campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a way, they whetted my appetite to hear and read more on the issue. Being an avid stamp collector, collecting stamps from those remote regions only added to my interest. Then I was fortunate to have as a role model in my early high school years a patrol officer from New Guinea. He had a remarkable impact on my life and I aspired to emulate him when I left school. Years have passed and I am now in this place representing constituents from the Franklin electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those many intervening years I have maintained my desire to visit areas of the Third World, as we call it. I have continued to be an active member of the many organisations throughout the world that play a vital role in ensuring that people from those developing countries are given as many and varied opportunities to obtain adequate health, medical, legal, educational, agricultural and social services that we take so much for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my former life as a school teacher, I saw my role as one of challenging students to think of what their role might be, what role their parents might have, and what role their community and their nation had in addressing many of these global issues, even though they seemed so far away and so remote from the local school classroom. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rapid rate of change over the last ten or so years has had an enormous impact on the need for development assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are lucky that many of us are now living in an era when the Cold War blocks have melted away and countries are emerging from behind the wall of failed ideologies. There is a real opportunity for countries to now rationally discuss development issues. We are finally able to settle and focus on the real heart of the matter&mdash;what best suits each country if it is to achieve sustainable and equitable economic growth, and how donor countries can best support that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is stated in the report, there are several key factors resulting from the end of the Cold War era. Massive changes to international trade brought about by the Uruguay Round agreements and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation have had dramatic impacts on many of the developing countries that neighbour us. Then there are the positive and negative influences flowing from the internationalisation of the world's money markets, and no doubt my esteemed colleague the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) will be talking on some of those, because I know he has a keen interest on those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional and ethnic clashes in Africa, the former USSR and the eastern European countries are a downside to the end of the Cold War. In many cases, they have created demands for humanitarian assistance, for refugee resettlement and for peacekeeping operations. Television coverage of these conflicts, now beamed into our houses ad nauseam, has focused citizens and their governments and the aid agencies to sit down and try and address these key problems. These have inevitably led to a transfer of resources away from what we had planned as longer-term developmental priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a realisation by most within the international aid sector that in order to halt ongoing outbreaks of civil disturbance, which will consume an ever increasing aid dollar, there needs to be put in place a proper structure which will diminish the need for peacekeeping and emergency relief measures. We have only to look at what has been happening in Africa in the last 12 months or so to see that, unless we do put in place these proper sets of structures, we will be continually revisiting the same parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final challenge to governments comes from a range of issues which flow from the globalisation of our world&mdash;something that we thought would never happen in our lifetime but is now taking place so rapidly with the breaking down of political boundaries and the movement of people. There are the issues of HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases, economic migration, drug trafficking, global warming, access to water resources and the deforestation of large areas of the world. My constituents say, `Where does Australia fit into this most complex of worlds and what does it really have to do with me in the town of Huonville or parts of Hobart?' I say to them that we have an obligation, as a group of citizens, as a state and as a country to focus on all of these issues because they will, they do and they are impacting on our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) in this place many times, Australia is fighting above its weight in the area of international development aid. I would like to think that AusAID, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is playing a key role throughout the world in addressing many of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate in my brief time in this place to be part of a House of Representatives inquiry into Australia's overseas aid in the health area. I soon realised that this area of aid is a very complex and involved thing. It involves the problems of where we send it, who is responsible, and the development, between the key players and the government, of a proper meshing of all the programs that are being run by the various agencies and NGDOs to ensure that people in various parts of the world&mdash;whether they be in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa or in Asia itself&mdash;are able to have their issues addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from that, I was fortunate to be part of a parliamentary delegation to PNG, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Samoa and Tonga. I was able to speak, at first hand, to ministers from the various countries, aid workers, volunteers, church groups and villagers. I was able to gain an insight into just how effective and ineffective, in some cases, our aid really was. I came to a realisation that, unless aid is project specific, we are not really going to gain the maximum benefit from the dollars that we put into these various aid agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very good report. It is very detailed. In section II it comes up with a very detailed outline of developments in the Australian overseas aid program in many countries. I recommend that all those who are interested in this issue of aid read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another chapter in section III which raises the issue of where we go next&mdash;the future directions. It raises such areas as human rights and peace building&mdash;and one only has to remember the key role that Australia is playing in the UN in the whole area of peacekeeping. Other issues are broadening the development debate in Australia, technology, the civil society, private sector development and labour standards, and the issues of debt and the environment, which my esteemed colleague will speak about after me. There are a huge number of issues that we need to focus on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is doing a fantastic job in this area. I feel proud to be a member of the government because the Australian Labor Party has involved itself very largely in the aid program. I know we have been focusing on a whole lot of other key issues, but we have not forgotten the aid program and the need for our party and our country to get involved in this key issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last page of the report identifies, in the conclusion, some key things that I would like to put on the record. In the last sentence of the second last paragraph, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By striving to alleviate poverty, a root cause of instability and human suffering, the aid program is making an important investment in our future security.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are those in Australia and overseas who want to reduce aid programs . . . And under the Labor Government there will be no turning back from engagement locally, regionally and internationally in working for a better world, for all citizens of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>From my brief time in this place, I think that sums up the Labor government's commitment, not only to its own citizens, but to the citizens of the world. I would like to place on record my deep indebtedness to the commitment of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). He has visited Tasmania several times and spoken to aid agencies there. His is not an easy ministerial portfolio, but he has fought for the whole area of international aid, and I commend him and AusAID for the wonderful work that they are doing. When I come back in the next parliament, I and many others who were involved in this issue will continue to fight for a just and equitable share of the Australian budget for many of these programs. Finally, I commend the report to those in Australia who are involved in the whole issue of Australia's overseas aid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two central points to be made as background to the discussion of the Australian development cooperation program report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Global change and Australia's overseas aid program</EMPHASIS>. The first is that there has been a very substantial improvement in living standards in many developing countries&mdash;in most of them, in fact&mdash;during the last two or three decades. This improvement is partly due to the effectiveness of development cooperation programs but is principally due to the countries' own efforts; and that is very encouraging. At the same time, it is also true to say that now, after three or more decades of substantial development, there are still an estimated 1.3 billion people living in absolute poverty and the need for development cooperation is as great as ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been learnt during the past three decades about the kinds of policies which will most effectively contribute to development within developing countries, and aid is now being very effectively targeted in ways that I will come to in a minute. But the need for the aid program is as high as it has ever been, and the reason is partly that there has been very rapid population growth within developing countries. Some countries have moved well away from needing aid, and many of those in our region&mdash;such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, which all used to be aid recipients a couple of decades ago&mdash;are now rapidly growing, wealthy countries in their own right and are themselves starting to give aid to others. Other countries still have major problems of poverty, despite relatively rapid economic growth; and Indonesia, which is our closest neighbour, and Papua New Guinea, the Pacific Islands and the countries of South Asia are very clearly in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very encouraging to see this excellent report by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), the sixth report in a series which began in response to a recommendation by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade in a review of the aid program. One of our recommendations was that there should be an annual statement to parliament on the principles, approaches and policies adopted by the Australian aid program, and that opportunity should be given to debate such a statement in parliament; and we have been given that opportunity today. I congratulate the minister both on producing the report and on the quality of the report. It is a fine report because it looks well into the future and brings up to date the principles that should be guiding our development cooperation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I principally want to look to the future but I want to make a couple of remarks about current activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, it is very good to see that the aid program is being increased. In the last budget, the increase in real terms was $25 million, an increase of 1.6 per cent, which means that Australia will this year spend 0.33 per cent of GNP of aid. That, of course, is well below the UN target of 0.7 per cent. It is below our performance of a decade ago, well below that of two decades ago, and well below the average of OECD countries. I am disappointed that the statement trots out the misguided figure of 0.29 per cent for the weighted average of OECD countries, a figure which is quite misleading because it weights aid contributions by the GNP of contributor countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very large contributor countries&mdash;particularly the US&mdash;which are mean in the extreme and which are cutting their aid most rapidly have undue weight. Those countries which are most generous&mdash;such as Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany and France&mdash;all give well above 0.29 per cent. In fact, several of them give closer to one per cent or 0.8 per cent. Such countries are given less weight, and so it is a very misleading figure. Taking a non-weighted, standard average, the figure is something closer to 0.45 or 0.43 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is well below that figure, and that is something for us to be ashamed of. Nevertheless, in a very difficult budgetary situation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs did battle in cabinet and achieved an increase in the percentage of GNP as aid, and I congratulate them on that. I am very glad to see Minister Bilney in the Main Committee with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate principally on the third section of this excellent paper, because it takes the framework and the concrete elements of policy beyond what has existed before. Section 3 begins with a recognition of the budgetary constraints which all donor countries are feeling, but it then goes on to talk about how we maximise the effectiveness of our aid. It draws attention to the fact that aid cannot simply be considered in isolation from other areas of policy, but that it must take account of programs which will maximise the impact on human rights as well&mdash;and not only civil and political rights but economic and social rights too. Section 3 also says that the aid should take account of security issues, and should look for means of improving human rights in all possible ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper goes on to talk about the contribution of aid to peace building, to the avoidance of conflict and the minimising of conflict once it has occurred, and about issues such as the institutionalisation of human rights, constitutional development, the strengthening of justice systems, and the encouragement of effective early warning systems. All of these are very important means of improving the quality of governance in ways that will also empower peoples so that development can be more effective and more equitably distributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper discusses the importance of broadening the development debate in Australia. A theme that I, amongst others, have taken up continuously for 20 years is the importance of development education to ensure that the whole Australian community has the opportunity to understand the aid program, its rationale and its importance not only in moral and humanitarian terms but also in terms of it being in our own interests to see countries in our region growing effectively and equitably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper mentions a number of means that are being used to stimulate the development debate in Australia: expanding research, increasing teaching about development in schools; research on the causes and effects of global poverty and ways of reducing it; and so on. I was very glad to see, in particular, the reference to the AusAID initiated research program being built up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have other subjects that I suggest might be taken up, in addition to those that are listed. The subjects that are listed include the impact of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation, reforms on Australia's food aid program, an analysis of the New Zealand experience with the migration of Pacific Island nationals, the implications for Australia's relationship with Pacific Island countries and a review of Japan's aid program. These are all nicely targeted, valuable studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are many other issues that could be taken up in such a research program. One area that has been particularly neglected in Australia is the damaging effect on developing countries of instability in the international financial system, and ways of reducing that instability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other topics include the development, and the importance of developing, global public goods. We live in a globalised world, as this statement very effectively articulates. The response to that is inevitably going to include the provision of certain types of public goods internationally and cooperatively by countries acting together. There needs to be more research in Australia on that very complex and important issue. There are already good examples of that kind of cooperation in telecommunications and in civil aviation, but more is going to be necessary in other areas such as reduction of financial instability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement goes on to talk about technology transfer, and ways of increasing use of appropriate technologies and  high technologies in developing countries. It has an excellent section on support for development of the civil society in developing countries. It offers ways of building up more honest and accountable governments and encouraging the expansion of the non-government sector, including not only obvious non-government organisations in the development area, but chambers of commerce, trade unions, the media, support for establishing legal systems and for the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all absolutely vital issues in any well-functioning society. In some countries in our region they are now well entrenched, but in others they are not. Right on our doorstep in Papua New Guinea, those activities are still relatively lively, but need support in order to maintain and strengthen their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an interesting section on the private sector. It is very important to find ways of enabling the private sector&mdash;through foreign investment, trade and technology transfer&mdash;to more effectively involve itself in development within developing countries. I was slightly surprised to see a reference to India being keen to study our approach to privatisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, absolutely not. But it is important to find ways of working cooperatively with the private sector. It is a refreshing emphasis in the aid program that this matter is now being given more attention. There is a very good section in the statement on labour standards. I will not go into it in detail, but it is thoroughly worth studying by anyone interested in those issues. It talks about the importance of strengthening regulatory frameworks, and of addressing all kinds of issues to do with training and trade union development, occupational health and safety, and minimising exploitation of child labour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an important section on debt&mdash;which could have gone further. The issue of debt is now under very active study in the international community. The World Bank has a very important internal study under way, under the direction of the new managing director, an American of Australian origin, Jim Wolfensohn. The outcome of that is not yet clear, but what has been talked about seems to be excellent, and is something that we should strongly support. There are other important sections on the role of agricultural research, on the difficulties caused by rapid urbanisation and of the importance of giving attention to the environment in our aid program. This is a most valuable report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by emphasising one of the final sections on the role of the United Nations, and the importance of reform of the UN. I was actively involved in the World Summit for Social Development, which concluded successfully with an excellent statement and a program of action on policies for reducing poverty, for increasing employment opportunities and for strengthening social solidarity. The conference made a whole series of recommendations about ways in which UN effectiveness could be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impressive to see that Australia contributed $83 million of its core aid funding to the UN last financial year. We should be proud of that. We should look for ways to increase it, while also increasing the effectiveness with which those funds are used within the UN system. It is vital that the Economic and Social Council be built up and become more effective. It is vital that the UN resources be strengthened. We must keep the pressure on the United States of America to discourage its appalling cuts in support for the UN. It is not even keeping up with its basic obligations, let alone anything else. It cannot be left to medium sized countries alone, such as Australia and Scandinavia, to support these activities in the UN. </PARA>

I had a meeting with the Vietnamese delegation that went overtime, but I was able to catch the last part of the member's speech on television, I was able to hear most of what the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) said. I am very grateful to both of them, not just for their contribution to this debate, but also for their contribution to the wider debate about aid in Australia. They have both been extremely supportive and informed participants. I am greatly indebted to them for the remarks they have made and for the continued interest they take in the aid program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few things I want to say in responding to the points that have been made in the debate, principally by the member for Fraser. Given that this will be my last statement to this parliament on the aid program, it has been a matter of great pride to me that I have been able to preside over what I believe is one of the best aid programs in the world, one which has sought to respond to changing circumstances in a very rapidly changing world. Trying to turn around the aid program quickly is like trying to turn around the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queen Mary</EMPHASIS> because so many of the commitments that are entered into tend to be multi-year commitments and one must carry through with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great emphasis that we have given to health and population activities during the last two years is such that we now devote over seven per cent of our program to these commitments, and the proportion is growing. Last year expenditure on those activities went above $100 million. That is something we can be proud of. The increasing emphasis we have given to micro-credit in providing poor people, usually poor women, with the means to alleviate desperate poverty, is something that we have got into in a larger way. Provided the pilot programs that we are running succeed, we can see that expanding a great deal in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there has always been an emphasis in the program on education, we are now shifting away quite rapidly from very expensive tertiary education provided in Australia&mdash;necessary and important as that is&mdash;to the provision of basic education, particularly for women and girls. This is one of the best ways to bring about genuine development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fraser mentioned the emphasis on the environment. That has certainly been something to which the program has responded. Last year, expenditure on environment related programs directly was of the order of $160 million. As well, the whole program is measured against a set of environmental standards which means that we do no harm to the environment and mostly do good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the three years that I have been in charge of the aid program, there has been a considerable shift in geographic emphasis. We are now much more involved in Indochina, as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam emerge from a very oppressed and unhappy history into playing their full part in our region. The aid program is doing its damnedest to help them with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an unfortunate change in emphasis&mdash;I say unfortunate when I refer to the amount of resources we are now devoting to humanitarian emergencies of one kind or another&mdash;unfortunate because I think many of us had hoped that with the end of the Cold War there would be an outbreak of peace. Unfortunately, the reverse has been true. There have been some tragic and appalling humanitarian catastrophes around the world to which our aid program has responded as best it can. I hope the day arrives when we do not have to spend money on this sort of thing. Something very decent in us responds to humanitarian catastrophes, and Australia has gone into places like Rwanda, Somalia and Bosnia through the aid program and in other ways to deal with those terrible emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fraser spoke very well of the need to widen the aid debate in Australia. He has always been on at successive ministers in that regard. While the amount of money that we are spending now on development education has not risen by much&mdash;it has more or less doubled, I think&mdash;we are trying to spend that money much more strategically. I am sure I give away no secrets when I say that we are trying to spend money on getting people in the schools and getting curriculums changed so that people learn about development issues in the schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My hope is that, by infecting children in schools with the desire for a better world through the aid program, the same sort of momentum and passion will be built up about those issues as was built up in the last 10 years about environmental issues. If that happens, then I think governments of whatever stripe will be powerless to resist the demand of people for&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For decency, as the member for Herbert rightly interjects. Part of that changing world is the new world of trade. One of the things that I have asked AusAID to look to in the next budget is how we can assist the countries of our region in particular, but also more widely, to deal with the new disciplines and rigours that are going to be placed on them by the coming of APEC and the new world of the World Trade Organisation. Let us be clear: there will be, if not winners and losers, big winners and less big winners in those new regimes. Through the aid program we need to look at how we can mitigate the pain for those who will suffer and smooth the transition to better societies which I believe freer trade will bring&mdash;but there are going to be some hiccups along the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fraser alluded to the levels of development assistance around the world. What the Republican controlled Congress is threatening to do with the United States aid budget in respect of particular programs is an unhappy circumstance. Population activity is a likely casualty, the World Bank is another and multilateralism in general is a target. Around the world one sees aid levels declining and it is very hard, with the best will in the world, to keep up the levels in Australia when all around us aid levels are dropping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that is a temporary phenomenon, because aid programs have a great deal to do. I welcome the fact that private investment flows are, in many parts of the world, helping to make up for a decline in ODA levels. But there will always be things that aid does which private investment cannot do. I hope we can look towards a better performance by some of our partners in that regard, thus keeping up our own efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking to the APEC statement, I would like to say, first of all, that I welcome that statement and am in strong agreement with it. I see it as another step forward in developing our trade relations in this region. But the big test is still ahead of us: we have to actually translate the good intentions and the good work that has been done so far into real results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look back, we find that this is a situation wherein the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is progressing the work of the former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke. It is built on some very solid work that was done earlier by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have also got to put it against this backdrop: Australia's share of East Asian imports has dropped by 20 per cent in the last 10 years and, since 1983, Australia has lost market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei. In fact, Australia's merchandise trade surplus with the APEC region has declined from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is particularly pleasing to see that the APEC agreement includes comprehensive coverage of all sectors, which means that agriculture is very much on the agenda. This brings Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to accept the need to address the matter. It also brings China into the camp of trade liberalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that the agreement covers all measures, both tariffs and non-tariff barriers. As the Prime Minister has stated, an example of a non-tariff barrier is that customs procedures can add 10 per cent to the cost&mdash;and many of the main impediments are non-tariff barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is heartening to note that the Prime Minister has noted in the APEC statement that the common harmonised system of tariff classification is to be worked on for 1996 and standard electronic customs message system and pilot mutual recognition agreement in the area of standards are to be introduced by 1999 and 1997 respectively. There is also a commitment to abolish export subsidies by the year 2010. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure this agreement should place on the United States to address these areas, which would, in turn, one would hope, put pressure on the European community, is a positive aspect. There could be some good spin-off effects in world trade, not just in the APEC region. If the APEC agreement does reach its objectives, it will benefit all commodities: grains, meat, dairy, wool, cotton, rice, sugar and horticultural products, such as dried fruits, grapes, citrus and apples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been stated that there is potential, if we can follow this through, for Australian farmers to generate around $2.9 billion worth of exports. These figures have come from the National Farmers Federation, which points out that that amount is in addition to the extra $1 billion we hope to see come from the Uruguay Round of the then GATT agreement. The agreement has yet to be translated into results but the potential appears to be there for some major benefits. As has been pointed out, those benefits are potentially three times as much as will come from the liberalisation of trade through the World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, our attention should not be diverted from the domestic issues and problems. If the benefits are really going to be translated back to our producers, particularly our farmers, we have to look at domestic cost structure problems, an area that the government seems to have been rather reluctant to take up the challenge on in recent times. I refer to problems in relation to the waterfront, industrial relations and, of course, excessive red tape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the speech of the President of the National Farmers Federation last week. In his address to the council he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs to be much greater commitment from government to advancing the domestic reform agenda. In my view, the government has hit the wall on reform . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He could not put it much more bluntly than that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is suffering from reform fatigue and its own agencies are providing the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to a report of the Bureau of Industry Economics he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent report . . . has highlighted widening performance gaps in Australia's infrastructure, especially in transport and power. This gap is a serious issue for all businesses, not just for farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to now talk about some specific issues that still have to be resolved. The first one is the proposed APEC Food and Agribusiness Task Force. I strongly support this move, as I believe it offers the chance to have the debate on our terms, particularly in light of the Food and Agricultural Organisation's summit to be held late next year. We have to get the discussion going on the whole question of food security because much more detail is needed. It really is important to see how the food security issue is going to be pursued. One would hope that we can start to move away from the subsidies to agriculture to much freer trade in this particular area. If we can look at food security in this new light of getting away from the subsidies, not only can Australia then extend the supply of agriculture and the products but we will be able to provide them much more cheaply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to overemphasise it, but I cannot overstate the need to address some of the domestic issues. I will quickly give you one example of where the government has really got reform fatigue. The overview in the Industry Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meat processing</EMPHASIS> that was brought out in April last year says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This inquiry has found that despite some recent improvements, Australia's meat processing industry operates at significantly higher cost than processing industries of most countries with which it competes. It has also found that Australian meat exports have been losing market share in almost all our major export markets.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a really damning comment on the whole question of the government's approach. The significant point is that that report came out 18 months ago but what have we seen since? We have seen a government, as the president of the National Farmers Federation pointed out, that has reform fatigue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the food and agricultural task force, I think it is very important that we should know more about it. In particular, we want to know who the members are going to be and what the agenda will be. The government ought to answer this. The Prime Minister has stated that he will be writing shortly to his APEC colleagues. I challenge the Prime Minister to release the details of what he intends to raise with them, because this will throw light on what is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue which I believe still has to be resolved is the action plan for the ministerial meeting to be held next year in the Philippines. It is terribly important that agriculture be kept at the top of the list because there is a real fear that the removal of trade barriers, particularly as they apply to agriculture, could be left until towards the end of the first period of 15 years. In terms of the action plan, it is very important that the government keep agriculture at the top of the list and up front. This is obviously going to be very much a challenge for the incoming government in the next parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue that requires a lot more work is how to link the APEC agenda for freer trade with the World Trade Organisation's agenda in its coming rounds, particularly with its first meeting coming up in December next year in Singapore. The question really has to be how Australia, with the Cairns Group, is going to use APEC to get the new round of the WTO going and to ensure that it is comprehensive and that it does include agriculture. In other words, we need to keep agriculture fairly and squarely at the top of the agenda. This is a major issue that still needs further work, and there is certainly no room for complacency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add another issue for consideration in the whole question of trade. Further questions that cannot be ignored include the possible effect of the continuing friction between the United States, Japan and China on market access, which is going to be a significant issue in the future; the moves by Japan, Korea and Taiwan&mdash;which are probably also going to be supported by China and Malaysia&mdash;to quarantine agriculture as a sensitive sector from the liberalisation process, which is a major issue; and the reluctance by the United States to accept the fact that each economy takes decisions individually rather than across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe this meeting is a significant and welcome step forward. If trade liberalisation can be realised, as has been put forward in the Prime Minister's statement, it will have very important and beneficial effects for the Australian economy. However, I would like to make sure that we keep this in some perspective, particularly given the effusive comments that the Prime Minister has made in his statement. I refer to a couple of editorials on the APEC agreement from newspapers in other countries. Firstly, Japan's most authoritative newspaper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nikkei Shimbun</EMPHASIS>, in referring to the APEC Osaka declaration, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a strong feeling that by using such vague language and by going without an element of compulsion the declaration has run away from dealing with difficult problems such as how to ensure implementation of liberalisation and comparability of measures taken by member nations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought those words would have been of concern to all members. Also the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS> derided the declaration as `a representative work of vague, bureaucratic language'. We have got to realise that this does raise some very serious questions. In particular, I wonder whether in fact the Prime Minister has been completely frank and honest when he said of the declaration that `You don't get it more solid than that' and that `It never gets as good as this', and made various other comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I think it is very important that we do get all members of APEC to support this outcome and deal with it in a spirit of enthusiasm as strong as Australia's. We also have to take into account what we have experienced in some of these discussions, and I come back to the Uruguay Round where we saw a very significant slippage in a round of discussions that was supposed to take four years. It took seven years, and of course we are still to see the full benefits of the agreement that came under the World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement certainly does give some heart to the exporting sector of Australia, particularly in agriculture, but the benefits are still to be realised and it is going to require a lot of hard work and a lot of determination. I believe that the incoming government is going to have to continue to pursue this with the same vigour as it has been pursued by the current Prime Minister and by the former Labor Prime Minister, Mr Hawke&mdash;and I also mentioned some of the earlier work that was done by the former Fraser government. I think that all of this has contributed to our seeing a move, hopefully to be translated into action, towards seeing much freer trade in our Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

It always amazes me that, when people here talk about the waterfront, the implications are that, if we could only get rid of the old waterside workers, all would be well.

I have attended a couple of seminars on this issue in the last couple of months. In fact, at the last one that we held in Sydney dealing with that report, the exporters did not even bother turning up. Everyone on the waterfront blames everyone else and everyone protects their own little bailiwick. Okay, there has to be reform on the waterfront but it has to go right across the waterfront&mdash;the exporters, the whole thing. The problem with the waterfront in Australia is that it has been a closed shop in every section for far too long and everyone has been intent on blaming everyone else instead of looking at their own failure to come together in a cooperative manner and do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to get into an argument about everything the honourable member for Wannon said, because I agree with much of what he said. The member for Wannon spoke about the reform of meat processing, but it seems to me that the real tragedies in the meat industry in Australia over the last few years are the subsidisation of meat and the substitution of meat. It is not the workers who slipped a bit of old kangaroo steak in there and passed it off as first-class beef. Some of the export firms did this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had two scares with the export of Australian beef, the first one being a couple of years ago when it was found that, in the United States and, indeed, in Japan, kangaroo meat had been substituted for fine beef. If there is one thing that will frighten a Japanese buyer away it is a whiff of scandal about anything. The Japanese are going mad about red-back spiders at the moment, and this situation will have an impact on our trade with Japan. Fruit fly in the mangoes in North Queensland and the whiff of a bit of Skippy being thrown in instead of bully beef terrifies the Japanese.

The process of establishing APEC as the key regional organisation began in Seattle in 1993 when, on the initiative of the Prime Minister, it was suggested to other APEC leaders that an annual leaders meeting be established. The Indonesian leaders meeting produced the Bogor declaration which committed APEC economies to the goal of free and open trade in this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two planks were set for this goal to be met: the free and open trade goal was to be met by industrialised countries by 2010 and by developing countries by 2020. With the goals declared at Bogor, the Osaka leaders meeting produced a plan of action which would show how APEC economies would implement the free and open trade goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said in his statement last week, Osaka is an outstanding success for Australia and all our objectives were met. Australia wanted a plan of action from this leaders meeting, and we achieved it. Australia wanted all 18 APEC economies to sign the declaration of free and open trade and investment in the region, and we achieved this. Sometimes it is easy to dismiss these summit meetings as being all pomp and ceremony and with little substance or resolution of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody can, with any credibility, foster this view of APEC. Concrete achievements have resulted from APEC. Japan will accelerate its Uruguay Round tariff reduction commitment on 697 items, including textiles, chemicals, steel and non-ferrous materials, by approximately two years. Everyone thought that the Japanese were going to be the real problem. Hong Kong will bind at zero a further five per cent of imports in addition to Uruguay Round tariff bindings, as well as deregulating its banking services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canada will exceed its Uruguay Round commitments by reducing tariffs on 1,500 items. It will extend its preferential tariff systems and extend NAFTA preferential treatment of investment to all WTO members. Indonesia has an important tariff reduction program which extends to 2003. It has also accelerated its Uruguay Round commitment to eliminate non-tariff barriers. Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, New Zealand, China, South Korea, Chile and the United States of America have all given similar commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has offered to accelerate commitments which we have already made. At Bogor, APEC leaders committed themselves to removing all trade barriers within 25 years. Realistically, this will never happen, but the target of removing most or many trade barriers is more than achievable. Osaka was the beginning of implementing the commitments established in the Bogor declaration. The Osaka action agenda sets principles which will underpin the process of trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific Region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eight principles have been agreed to, and are designed to set broad parameters within which APEC's liberalisation and facilitation program can be implemented. These principles are GATT and WTO consistency, comparability, timing and standstill&mdash;which refers to refraining from increasing existing levels of protection, flexibility, non-discrimination and comprehensive coverage. The central achievement for Australia was that all sectors and issues will be covered by these new principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agriculture is now firmly on the APEC agenda. Agriculture is one area that has consistently missed the boat when countries have negotiated trade liberalisation and open markets. Australia has the most efficient agricultural sector in the world. Our farmers and their produce are competitive with farmers and produce from Europe and Asia. I assume that Australian farmers will be feeling very content with the Osaka results. It now enables them to plan confidently for the opening up and liberalisation of the huge markets in this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing principles Osaka has also established the process for trade liberalisation. Leaders directed ministers and officials to immediately begin the preparation of concrete and substantive action plans to be submitted for assessment to the l996 ministerial meeting in the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall implementation of the action plans will formally begin in January l997 with an annual review. Ministers have been instructed to engage in a collective confidence-building effort to facilitate exchanges of information, to ensure transparency and to work towards the achievement of comparability of respective action plans. This is particularly significant, given that no country will be prepared to make serious cuts in trade barriers if that country believes that other countries are not going to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC economies have emphasised that opposition to an inward-looking trading block, and are committed instead to firmly maintain open regional cooperation. I agree with the Prime Minister that the regular involvement of the leaders of APEC economies gives the meetings an authority and purpose that cannot be matched&mdash;with no disrespect to ministers&mdash;by a meeting of ministers alone. The Prime Minister should be commended on his initiative and for his subsequent campaign to ensure that the leaders are fully involved and have a stake in the result. At the Osaka meeting the leaders urged other WTO members to match the efforts of APEC. That is something that G7 members could not bring themselves to do earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as agreeing on the principles of trade liberalisation, a number of important trade facilitation measures were established. These include greater cooperation among customs agencies, agreement on how product standards are to be used in excess, work on common approaches approving product standards for food, toys, cooperation over standards for telecommunication equipment and collaboration over human resource management issues. While these are not as valuable or, indeed, as sexy as cuts in trade barriers, they are nonetheless important because, for example, customs procedures alone can add 10 per cent to the cost of doing business and, although tariffs within the region remain high, many businesses suffer because of impediments in the non-tariff areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modelling by the Office of National Assessment and the Industry Commission, while backing up earlier conclusions, also suggest that, when the full effect of the Bogor commitments flow through the income of APEC members, this will increase by 3.8 per cent or by $745 billion. For Australia this means our real incomes will rise by 6.8 per cent or $40 billion when all the effects have flowed through. This can be expected to generate something like 500,000 new jobs over the course of the liberalisation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am preparing one of the famous Hollis information kits on the Osaka APEC meeting for my constituents, which I am happy to send you a copy of.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the outcome of the APEC summit at Osaka this month where the Asia-Pacific leaders recommitted themselves to the goal of free and open trade and investment in our region by the year 2020. While this basic commitment was established at the Bogor declaration 12 months ago, the momentum of APEC continues to grow and Osaka was an important step along an often rocky road to trade liberalisation. The APEC action agenda agreed to by the 18 nations represented at Osaka provides a blueprint to achieve this trade liberalisation and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific area. It sets out the broad direction and mechanisms to achieve such free trade. However, the real test for APEC is converting the words into action. I will talk about that later and illustrate with some things from my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade liberalisation and better trade relations with our <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">neighbours has been an objective of recent Labor and coalition governments. In response to the ministerial statement on APEC by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the goals of APEC are shared in common by both sides of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also not just a recent phenomenon, as some may wish us to believe. One needs only to look back to the trans-Tasman CER agreement with New Zealand under Doug Anthony and Malcolm Fraser in the early 1980s for evidence of that bipartisan commitment to improving trade relations and eliminating trading barriers with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the real difference in political terms will come in how well the Australian economy can be managed to adjust to the changing circumstances to enable our exporters to take full advantage of the benefits of free trade. It will be our response to APEC where the difference will be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the benefits of APEC are many. As the Prime Minister and other commentators have already pointed out, there are potentially very substantial benefits to flow from APEC, not least of which is a $40 billion a year boost to Australia's national output and the possibility of the creation of 500,000 jobs by the year 2010. The benefits include $25 billion in tariff cuts and $15 billion to be saved by reducing non-tariff barriers such as varying standards for industrial products and clashing customs regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within my own electorate of Hinkler, the growing industrial city of Gladstone is set to benefit most from freer and more open trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Already Gladstone is a major exporter to the Asia-Pacific region, principally with the export of its vast coal reserves from central Queensland. The Gladstone Port Authority's coal handling facility currently handles around 24 million tonnes annually, rising to 30 million tonnes within the next four years. There are plans to eventually increase its capacity to 45 million tonnes, which the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) claims will make it the largest coal loading facility in the world by tonnage&mdash;which is an extraordinary thing, no doubt. The minister predicts there will be a continuing strong demand for coal exports, especially in South-East Asia, where coal is needed for power generation. He cites Thailand, which plans to build one power station a year for 15 years, requiring a new mine each year to supply coal to fuel those power stations. Again, that is an extraordinary potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gladstone also is a major producer and exporter of alumina and aluminium products. According to the 1993-94 report of the Gladstone Port Authority, the port exports 2.7 million tonnes of alumina to Canada, China, New Zealand and the US, and 166,000 tonnes of aluminium to Japan, Korea and Taiwan. In the future Gladstone is set to become a major potential producer and exporter of another light metal, magnesium. From aluminium and magnesium, of course, flows the potential for alloys. A $50 million joint venture between Queensland Metals Corporation and the CSIRO is working on developing the process to make magnesium metal and magnesite mixed from the Kunwarara deposit near Rockhampton. The decision on where to locate the commercial smelter will not be made until 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gladstone is also emerging as a major producer of other export commodities, such as chemicals, cement, woodchips and, very interestingly, ice-cream sticks. It is not popularly known that Gladstone makes 1.3 billion ice-cream sticks a year, 70 per cent of which are exported. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chopsticks are on hold, but it is an industry that could go ahead, and with this APEC thing, as I have said to the general manager of that firm as recently as today, that potential needs to be reinvestigated. He pointed out to me that they do come up against some very great difficulties. For example, various tariffs, taxes and duties mean that they are paying 30 per cent extra to get their products into Malaysia, 30 per cent extra to get them into Thailand and 25 per cent extra to get them into Indonesia. It will be interesting to see how all those nations embrace APEC and whether those tariffs, barriers and so on fall away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing he mentioned to me as a great challenge&mdash;and I do not want to be partisan in this debate, but, in the light of recent events in industrial relations, the thing that really stands out, he said&mdash;is the perception in Asia of the poor performance of Australian wharves. I know that the government claims that this has been improved considerably, but the perception still remains that our facilitation of export is not reliable. He said that affects him&mdash;someone who is selling only ice-cream sticks. There are also plans to develop a container facility at the port of Gladstone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elsewhere in the electorate, we have industries such as beef, sugar and horticulture. As you probably know, Bundaberg is one of the largest producers of horticultural products in Australia, and at times even tops Bowen as Australia's leading tomato grower. We have had some very interesting developments in that field. Currently we export over 200,000 cartons of tomatoes, largely to New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. SP Export in particular are looking at the markets in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The barriers they see have come from quarantine and artificial trade barriers. They are looking forward to APEC breaking down those barriers and giving them a greater opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting industry in my electorate is Wide Bay Brick. You might say, `Surely no-one in Australia exports bricks.' But, indeed, this firm does. This is the largest privately owned brickworks in Australia and it exports three million bricks, mainly to New Zealand and Japan. It is also looking at markets in Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and New Caledonia. It has problems with trade barriers too, especially in Malaysia with its high import duties. It also has a problem with the freight component, which comes back to the wharves and, to some extent, shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another firm that is quite different again from small crops and bricks is Electra Breweries. That firm currently produces just under a million cartons of brewed ginger beer, 20 per cent of which is exported. New Zealand is the biggest market and it receives about 200,000 cartons of Bundaberg ginger beer every year. It has started trial marketing into Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the US. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a lot of cases, there are different customs barriers, labelling laws and import duties, and that makes it particularly difficult for Electra Breweries to penetrate those markets. To come back to Thailand, the various duties that apply mean that the firm's product in Thailand will cost nearly twice as much as the comparable local product. So there is a big challenge there for us to try to cut down on those barriers and on our own export facilitation costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APEC commitment not only provides Australian exporters with great opportunities, but also with great challenges. Just because the Asia-Pacific region is committed to moving towards freer and more open trade, that does not necessarily mean that Australia will automatically increase its market share in the region. I have just illustrated this using a number of firms in Gladstone and Bundaberg as examples. In fact, our trade performance in the APEC region has actually been falling over the past decade or so&mdash;that is, falling in relative, not gross, terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, our exports to APEC countries have roughly doubled from $US13 billion in 1985 to $US26 1/2 billion in 1993. However, in that time the APEC import market has almost trebled and our share has slipped from 4.09 to 3.09 per cent. In other words, the market has trebled but our share has dropped. So, in relative terms, we are not performing as well in Asia as we might. If we had been able to hold our share of the market in the APEC region, that would have been worth another $US9 billion a year to us at present in export earnings. That is a lot of money to forgo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, if Australia is to take advantage of the emerging APEC opportunities we must get our domestic economic settings right. While I am on this point, I would like to quote Don McGauchie of the National Farmers Federation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trade liberalisation is surging ahead, but domestic reform has hit a brick wall and the Federal Government must act quickly if Australia is to remain competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the federal government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has effectively put reform on hold until the next election. It has no stomach for the major tasks of reducing the current account deficit, tax reform and introducing true flexibility into the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, I will not be partisan about that, but I think we should reflect on it a little because it is an important component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront, as I said before, is a very important aspect of Australia being competitive in the APEC region. A recent Bureau of Industry Economics report said that the waterfront remains one of the key problem areas for Australia, with long and variable unloading times and high prices characterising the movement of containers through our ports. The report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Port charges to load or unload a container at Johore in Malaysia were only $85&mdash;one third of those at Adelaide . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is Australia's cheapest container port&mdash;again, a great illustration of the point I was making earlier. The report also found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It took twice as long to move a container at Adelaide as at the best comparably sized offshore port&mdash;Zeebrugge in Belgium.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another illustration of how we have to lift our act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our coal handling ability at ports such as Newcastle and Hay Point was as good as any in the world, the BIE report identified telecommunications, electricity and rail freight as areas of the economy that were marring our performance and producing lower productivity. In short, I think we could do it better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I tracked through a number of industries in my electorate, the thing that came through from many people&mdash;and, again, I do not want to be unduly critical&mdash;was that they thought Austrade could lift its game in the area of market intelligence. For example, one company that I spoke with sought from Austrade the range of competitive industries in a country in South-East Asia and Austrade missed the largest group in that country. That cost this particular industry in my electorate a lot of money because had they been alerted to that fact they could have done better. The other point I made, and we have talked about it in this address, is that the smallest unit product in my electorate, ice-cream sticks, is already affected by the perception of Australia's waterfront performance. I think there are a number of areas there on which we should reflect as we move into APEC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always of interest to look at the way in which the international associations of which Australia is a member&mdash;or those that represent Australia&mdash;report back to the parliament on where they are, where they are going and what they have achieved. There is little doubt that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sees himself rather large in international gatherings of this character and would rather that others see him as he sees himself. I hate to tell him but I do not think that is so. I think there are a few problems in this international perspective. There are a few aspects of this APEC forum that illustrate that and I want to address those now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think due credit must be paid to the Prime Minister and to successive Prime Ministers&mdash;to Bob Hawke, to Malcolm Fraser, and way back to Bob Menzies and John McEwen who started the whole process. If we look at where we are going economically, Australia has been helped enormously by moving away from total dependence on the United Kingdom and the UK-Australia trade agreements. The fact is that Britain had a very good capacity to be able to take advantage of Australia's developing economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Europe expanded and the Treaty of Rome began the European Community that it is today, and Britain quite properly decided she was going to become a member, of course, the UK-Australia trade agreement was concluded and Australia had to turn elsewhere. We have been very fortunate that, over the years since that 1956 signing of the Japan-Australia trade agreement, since the wheat deals were first negotiated with China, there has been a tremendous economic development in the economies of each of those countries to our north and also the relationship between us. If we look statistically, however, we will find that, sadly, Australia's proportional share is declining. Although in volume we are increasing, our proportional share is in fact less today than it used to be. That is a matter which needs to be identified and we need to see what steps can be taken to redress it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, part of the problem that I see for this APEC meeting is that what we need to do in any of these international groups, as far as possible, is to be inclusive not exclusive. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister&mdash;not just with respect to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)&mdash;tends to feel that the more he can keep himself a little isolated from everybody else, the better, and that is my worry with APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC would be better if it were a wider organisation. I think it is sad that, after this third meeting, they are still quite content to look at the 18 members that there are today and say, as the Prime Minister says, `We know where we are going and we are quite content.' I think it is important that we look at to what degree we can bring other countries of Asia&mdash;and, perhaps, some more of the countries of the South Pacific&mdash;into the APEC group. We could have all of the spectrum, if you like. The big, populous countries, such as India, the countries which are struggling to find a new way, such as Russia, and smaller countries, such as Fiji, all have roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that the membership of 18 is where it should stay. Indeed, it is a forum for Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. Let us face it, `Asia' embraces more than just the countries around the Pacific. I think the countries of the Indian subcontinent have to be encouraged to turn to this part of the world to try to develop commercial relations, so that we can expand our relations in that area. I hope that the membership of India is considered before long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel the same about Russia, having visited Vladivostok, Port Nachodka and a few other such places in the east of Russia. We need to make sure that they are allowed to consider themselves a Pacific power. In the days when I visited, they were still part of the Soviet Union, and I believe there has been little change. Essentially, most of the major decisions are still taken in Moscow. Moscow is a long way from those centres on the Pacific coast, and I think it is very important that we encourage those countries which have some association with that area to starting thinking of the Pacific. I would be all in favour of including Russia too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of the problems. I know it is not going to be easy. I know the achievements of the last three summit meetings mean that the countries which are there feel that they have got a relationship which can be properly developed if there is a benefit in it, as there is. All those things need to be acknowledged. But I do not think we should look at the APEC group as being inclusive only of those who are present members. That was the first of the points I wanted to make with respect to the progress of this third meeting in Osaka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that strikes me about the achievements or otherwise of the Osaka meeting is that it is worthwhile that those goals towards breaking down tariff barriers that were set in Bogor have virtually been confirmed. I was talking to some people after the Bogor meeting&mdash;I think I was in either Thailand or Indonesia&mdash;when it occurred to me that whatever goals might be set internationally, and whatever we might think of the outcomes, we need to see outcomes in the terms of each of the participants. In fact, that point was made by the Malaysian trade minister after this Osaka meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, those achievements are seen differently by other countries from the way we see them. That was certainly true of the Bogor conclusions. Many countries, looking at the Bogor agreement and reading the proclamations made by Paul Keating, would have said, `Trade is going to be totally free in this region for the developing world by 2010, and for the developed world by 2020.' But, having talked to the representatives of other countries&mdash;as I am sure I did in Indonesia, as well as in Thailand&mdash;I know there is a real problem. The interpretation of the Malaysian foreign minister, a very articulate lady, suggested that they also had reservations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody is going to try and put their own interpretation on it, so I do not think we ought to get too rapt in the gloss that Prime Minister Keating gives to the conclusions of Osaka. I think they are moving in the right direction&mdash;we all hope that what he says is right&mdash;but I suspect that the interpretation of others might not be quite as conclusive, in terms of those 2010 and 2020 objectives, as many of us would like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing I wanted to comment on was the fact that, in Australia, we have always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with the United States. I am one of those who feel very strongly&mdash;as I know my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who is in this Main Committee with me, does&mdash;that the defence relationship through ANZUS has been very important to Australia. It is also very important to other countries in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me about our relationship with the United States is that the United States is still so introspective. It is an enormous economy with enormous capability, and so matters outside the United States tend to be considered to be peripheral. The Osaka meeting would have been enhanced if President Bill Clinton had been able to attend and had not been so preoccupied with his conflict with the legislature in the United States over budget processes. If President Clinton had attended, there is no doubt that the Osaka conclusions would have been so much more valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is said without prejudice to the fact that America has been a very strong supporter of the economic goals set by APEC. It is also said without prejudice to the fact that those who were there did a very good job. However, it is very important that the United States continues to be a positive advocate within APEC; that the United States President is present at meetings of the heads of government; and that the United States President, in whatever forum, remains a major participant. The President is a very important player and the United States, above all, is a critical factor in the future of APEC. It is important, therefore, that the United States continues to be encouraged to play a leading role. It is unfortunate that without the United States' presence at the highest level, the conclusions of APEC are not quite as conclusive as the rhetoric of the Prime Minister suggests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other details interest me. In the statement there is reference to the technical committee on which Neville Wran was Australia's representative. I think that the committee was called the Eminent Persons Group. The Prime Minister was lavish in his phrase. I know that he is keen on providing jobs for his colleagues, but I feel that there are many far more eminent people in the field for which APEC is noted than Neville Wran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it appals me that Neville Wran and people like him have been appointed as the receivers for the Australian National Line. That is not necessarily the way you solve a major national problem, and to say that Neville Wran should be the person to represent Australia in the Eminent Persons Group is absolute nonsense. If you wanted to have a politician, I believe Doug Anthony would have been far more suitable. He has been a senior trade minister and he knows most of these people personally. It is better, if you have a trade objective, that you have someone with knowledge in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationships between the Commonwealth and the states are important. We need to recognise the very important role that state premiers and state ministers play but, for goodness sake, do not let us think that they are necessarily thinking about wider Australian interests. Nor do they have a capacity to represent Australia as well as some other people could. Indeed, we have many others of considerable distinction, not necessarily at a party political level, who could have filled that role with greater eminence and with greater capacity to turn the outcomes towards Australia's advantage than the former New South Wales Premier, Neville Wran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other things that I wanted to address are related to whether APEC should be a body concerned only with trade and economic issues. I know that it is an economic conference. I know we have problems with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir's organisation&mdash;the far east sphere of cooperation or cohabitation or whatever it is called&mdash;which has had a series of meetings from which Australia has been excluded. That and the economic emphasis should not really be what this forum is about. It is important that heads of government meet, and the distinguished coterie of people who have been present at each of these three APEC meetings shows that, but there are many other issues where APEC has a capacity to make some judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not too sure that a time when Australians were so concerned about French nuclear testing in the South Pacific was not an appropriate one for the Australian Prime Minister to have canvassed the issue. I know that the United States and some of the other countries attending might well have had a different view but Japan, the host of the meeting, certainly would have had the same view as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that a country such as Australia, where there are important regional issues, uses every possible opportunity to pursue its political and economic goals.

I would trust that it is possible for those sorts of matters to be dealt with in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of attendees and the realisation of the extent to which prime ministers and people such as Vice-President Gore of the United States participated make it remarkable that so much was done at the Osaka meeting. The outcome is worth while. From the opposition point of view, we look forward to at least maintaining Australia's role in the future. I was very pleased that the honourable  member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), identified that as his commitment. It is important that APEC is preserved, and a coalition government after the next election will do that to even greater advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my opening remarks I express my gratitude to the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), who has made it possible for me to participate in the debate at this stage, and to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for his comments. In addressing the ministerial statement on APEC the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made the comment that farmers across Australia would be grateful for the outcome of the Osaka meeting. I think he is right: the farmers across Australia will be grateful. But it is wrong for the member for Throsby to presume on the gratitude of farmers merely as a result of several bilateral conversations and conferences on trade that have occurred recently in Osaka as an outcome of the original Bogor agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important as the outcomes are to farmers across Australia, the reality is that farmers will find themselves at the cutting edge of competition, able to participate in these new trade arrangements only if there is some sort of reform to our competition policy. Comments have been made by others&mdash;the member for New England, particularly the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and even those opposite&mdash;about the incapacity of Australian farmers to be competitive, largely because of the difficulties they face in finding a competitive industrial relations and waterfront structure. The cost of their goods is forced up by the non-competitive arrangements in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very conscious of this because, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I represent a number of horticultural industries which have felt that they have been inadequately represented and disadvantaged in the trade debate, that they have been pawns in an enormous world trade game and that the government has not recognised their needs. It has been much more difficult than the government might imagine for members of the opposition to support this trade liberalisation. Conversely, it would have been much easier for opposition members&mdash;particularly those who represent manufacturing seats, as does the member for Aston, or those such as the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and I, who all represent horticulture seats&mdash;to have been much more critical of the government and to have received short-term praise for standing up for the electorates&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension, I was saying that one of the things that disappointed me about the statement on APEC made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was that he at no stage alluded to the cooperation that he had had from the opposition in achieving this trade liberalisation. Liberalisation has occurred not only through the APEC conference but as a result of the exercises of the opposition in government, of people like Prime Minister Fraser and Mr Anthony, and prior to that in the years 1971 and 1972 when the opposition when in government committed itself to joining some form of trade liberalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Werriwa has gone out of his way to be critical of the opposition. Even if one chose not to concede the degree of cooperation that had been inherent in the Fraser and Anthony regimes, it is certainly fair to say that under the Leader of the Opposition the opposition has in fact been totally supportive of the whole of the arrangements of trade liberalisation. It has been difficult, much more difficult than the government has sometimes conceded, in electorates such as yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, and mine to stand for trade liberalisation in the face of the criticism that comes from some of the industries within our electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole APEC arrangements give great opportunities to Australian farmers, but we should never deceive ourselves by pretending that what Australia is entering into is an agreement where in fact there will be a level playing field for agricultural industries or for any other industries. When I am speaking to those people in my own electorate who are most critical of the arrangements that we have in a bipartisan way entered into for the lowering of tariff barriers, and they suggest to me that we have in some way been duped, I point out to them that, if you want an analogy about what has happened in world trade, you really ought to consider world trade as some sort of enormous card game that has in the past been played by people who had loaded decks&mdash;decks loaded decidedly to Australia's disadvantage. What has happened under both the APEC agreement and the WTO agreement is that the world trade game goes on being played by people who have loaded decks, but the decks are not as loaded as they were and all the players are obliged to play with their hands above the table instead of below the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is quite an advantage, an advantage that the Prime Minister points out is expected ultimately to deliver $40 billion to Australia and by the year 2010 to create 500,000 new jobs. In common with the Leader of the Opposition and all other members of the opposition, I congratulate the Prime Minister on that having been achieved. I only wish the spirit of bipartisanship which has characterised the debate, often at the expense of opposition members, was recognised by more members of the government. The outcome of these agreements is very important, not just for Australian farmers and not just for Australian manufacturing industries, but for the entire globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, it is calculated that half a million new jobs could be created in Australia. What we need to appreciate is that even more important than this opportunity for job creation in Australia is the grim reality that the world population, which now sits at 5.6 billion people, by the year 2025, not long after the year 2010 which is so much a feature in the APEC agreement, will have grown to 8.5 billion people. Whereas today it is calculated that 700 million people go hungry around the globe, by the year 2025 it is calculated that, unless there is a change in our attitude to food production, 2.3 billion or a quarter of the population of the globe may well go hungry. That is one individual figure that we ought to be worried about, as a free nation in this corner of the globe, because nothing produces political instability faster than the threat of hunger, understandably so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy we face, particularly in this corner of the globe, has been that the construction and maintenance of tariff walls has ensured that some of our major competitors are producing less food than they would otherwise produce and producing it in the face of what is increasing land degradation and pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Countries like Japan and Korea have the object of being self-sufficient in food production. That self-sufficiency will never be achieved and right now that self-sufficiency is being pursued at a great deal of national expense, not only because there are trade barriers making it difficult for us to enter those countries but also because, in order to be self-sufficient in food, their farmers are being encouraged to pour on more in the way of nitrates and so add to the pollution. As we lower trade barriers, we provide greater opportunity, not only for Australian farmers to have access to the markets of Korea and Japan and other Asian markets as covered by the 18 signatories of the APEC agreement but also greater opportunity to provide those people, particularly the people of Japan and Korea, with the food they need at prices they can afford and, in addition to that, the opportunity to relieve them of the sort of environmental degradation and pollution that inevitably follows the well-intentioned but impossible objective of food self-sufficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point was very clearly made in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 18 October this year written by Mr Julian Cribb who penned the following words:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were free trade in farm products, our security would be redoubled, as the most efficient regions would be encouraged to grow more food.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However if Japan, Korea and others pursue their myopic course, they will defeat this vital objective of stability. They will also exacerbate needless destruction of the environment, the clearing of forest on poor soils to make way for domestic food production. In densely settled areas, they will ruin their waterways with fertiliser, sediment and pesticides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the absurd prices they charge their consumers, they will contribute to global inflation, higher interest rates and lower consumer purchasing power. They will also, self-defeatingly, ensure that the poor countries&mdash;often highly efficient farmers&mdash;stay poor.</PARA>
<PARA>Further up in the article, Mr Cribb stated:</PARA>

<PARA>I join previous speakers in commending the government on this initiative and I join the member for Hinkler in calling for the government to embrace also those sorts of domestic reforms, particularly in the waterfront and in industrial relations, which will allow our manufacturers and farmers to retain the competitive edge and to be both the food bowl and a significant manufacturing sector for this corner of the globe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the APEC meeting in Osaka, one of the things that he talked about was that 60 per cent of the world's GDP was represented in APEC. That may well be a meaningful statement to those who are closely involved with the activity, putting APEC together and attending the meetings and so on, but I think it might be useful, just for the benefit of those who are much more likely to listen to what I have to say perhaps as opposed to the Prime Minister, to spell out for the record what that means in much more everyday terms. The statement about 60 per cent of the world's GDP is probably a fairly meaningless statement to most, although it is an important statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 18 countries in APEC, including ourselves, and the countries range from very small ones such as Brunei to major countries such as Canada with nearly 30 million people, China with over one billion people, Indonesia with nearly 200 million, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore&mdash;which is small but important&mdash;Thailand, Chinese Taipei and, of course, the United States. We are actually talking about 18 countries, where the population at the moment exceeds two billion people. That is a fair chunk of the world's population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, when you were making your valuable contribution to this place a short while ago, you mentioned the populations projected in a few years time, but the reality is that two billion people are still an awful lot of people. They are very much the people who are right on our doorstep, so to speak, with whom we are going to have a very close relationship. It is also perhaps interesting to note that, of those 18 countries, apart from Chile, which has got just under 50 per cent of its exports going to other APEC countries, there is not a single one of those countries that has less than 60 per cent of its exports going to other APEC countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very powerful trading organisation and structure. It is not a bloc; it is not trying to lock out others. It is an attempt to liberalise world trade and to make sure that we can all gain from the process. We are talking about very substantial sums of money, very substantial blocs of people and an important international relationship within APEC itself. The other thing to mention is that a lot of these countries are rapidly growing countries with rapidly growing economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in Indonesia last year. We talk about Indonesia glibly as having 193 million people at the present time but, of course, many of those people are pretty poor. The reality is that Indonesia has a middle class, with what we would regard as a reasonable standard of living, of about 25 million people. It is not a large proportion but it is still a greater number of people than in the whole of Australia, and Indonesia is growing at a phenomenal rate of knots. Malaysia, which has a population slightly larger than ours, is growing at a rate of eight or nine per cent a year and has been for seven or eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these countries are improving their wealth; therefore, they are improving their consumerism. Quite apart from the population growth itself, there is an improvement in living standards. That means there is more demand for products and, whether they are raw materials, whether they are finished products, whether they are skills, services or whatever it is, there is going to be increasing demand, particularly in this part of the world, for the next few years. It is important that we understand that this is a very critical and vibrant part of our future as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been three meetings of APEC at heads of government level&mdash;the Seattle meeting of 1993, the meeting at Bogor in Indonesia in 1994 and the just completed Osaka meeting which is the basis of this debate. The next meeting, next year, is to be in the Philippines. It is important that we remind ourselves that what it is all about is free and open trade, and investment, by all of these countries by the target dates of 2010 or 2020&mdash;2010 for the developed countries and 2020 for the developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have said, and the opposition acknowledges, the government has had a number of good points coming out of this round of meetings, particularly the Osaka meeting. The inclusion of food is, of course, a vital one from the point of view of Australia. But there is also a firm timetable to take the next step. It is not just some glorious talking shop; there is actually to be a firm timetable of progress. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the leaders of the major nations and of all of these nations are taking part in the discussions in itself seems to me to be fundamentally different from many of the other international structures we frequently see. So often, the bureaucrats come together, they evolve a lowest common denominator position, if you like, and that is staffed up through the various national governments&mdash;and then the leaders come together and sign something which is often not very earth-shattering at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time, what we are seeing is the leaders of the countries&mdash;those who can commit their countries&mdash;coming together and sitting down to work out the principles, signing off on the agreement and then saying to the bureaucrats, `Now go and dot the i's and cross the t's.' That is a fundamental difference. In fact, it is showing the way&mdash;it seems to me&mdash;to many in the World Trade Organisation and, indeed, in G7 where we do not see that happen very often at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of specific measures announced. They include, for example, the introduction of a common harmonised system of tariff classification, which is to be effective by next year; the electronic customs message system, by 1999; and a pilot scheme for mutual recognition agreements in standards, by 1997. Coming from an electorate where there are some 6,000 small businesses, many in the engineering and technical field, I can certainly say that standards and international standards are a particular sore point for many of them. They will be delighted to see that we are going to come up with some common recognised standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of this place get the opportunity to travel overseas from time to time, be it on study tours, with delegations or in other forms. I think this is a very vital element of what a member of parliament does because these days, with international trade, economy, business and communications, if you do not go and have a look, meet and talk to people overseas and see what is happening you are going to get left out of the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate in the last two or three years to go to places such as Canada, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand as well as the United States&mdash;and all of those countries are members of APEC. I have not been to all of the APEC countries and I believe the next speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), probably would claim a much more extensive travel itinerary. But he has also been in the House somewhat longer than I have, so that is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that in going to those countries you actually start to understand some of the issues and complexities that are involved in trade. You get a chance to talk to people there at government and bureaucratic levels and also to those in private business. It seems to me that that is a very important communication that we were probably not getting the advantage of 20 years ago in the way that we are today. It is that knowledge, communication and understanding that is going to help develop things like APEC in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently attended the APEC networking conference in Adelaide which I found to be very valuable. From that contact and my subsequent visits, a number of issues came out. Firstly, we have to understand that there are cultural differences between Australia and many of the countries that we want to deal with. It is no good complaining about that. It is a reality that we have to come to grips with. We have to understand that the cultural differences in the way other countries approach doing business is going to be a factor in the way that we negotiate some of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure in many of those countries is a major problem. I was in Malaysia a couple of months ago and the reality there is that they have major environmental and pollution problems. The reality there is that, although they are building modern roads right across the country, they are prone to major mud slides and rock falls and so on in many of the mountainous parts of Malaysia, and that is a major impediment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I was there, the island of Penang&mdash;which is not only a holiday island, as most Australians would know, but also has a very heavy commercial and industrial base&mdash;lost its electricity for a full 24 hours, and then four or five days later it lost it again for a few hours. If you do not have a clean and reliable electricity supply, then as a country you have a number of problems, and often you cannot attract the businesses that you want to attract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that many of these countries which do not want to go at the pace that we want to go at have problems that we do not suffer from. Many of the APEC countries also have a skills and education shortfall. For many of the countries that we are talking about, whilst there are a number of highly skilled people and highly educated people, nevertheless there are not always the education levels or the special technical knowledge that is available here. That applies to Malaysia and a number of the other APEC countries that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at political stability. We perhaps take that for granted here. We have a robust parliament, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) mentioned in the main chamber earlier this morning during a debate on another subject. I think we would all agree that it does tend to be robust on occasions, but the reality is that we actually have a very stable political system in this country. Not all the countries in APEC enjoy that benefit, and that often motivates and drives some of their actions in terms of trying to come up with trade agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the little tricky areas&mdash;not so little but certainly very tricky&mdash;concerns human rights. We deal with and trade with and want to trade with many of these countries, and a lot of them have a different view of human rights from Australia's interpretation. We have to make some judgments about whether we close our minds to certain human rights concerns in the interests of trade or the other way around, but it is an area to be considered. Another point that I would make is that a number of these countries in APEC are receiving direct aid from Australia, so we are not only looking to trade with them, but actually pumping money into their economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me there are a number of opportunities in this agreement for Australian business. The large companies will already be trading overseas anyway, as they have the resources. There are a number of government agencies in these user-pays days which are trying to get in on the act and sell their services overseas, but it seems to me that the small companies are the ones that we really have to now try to encourage to take advantage of the arrangements being made under APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those are concerned about the costs. They do not have the knowledge of the markets, or they do not often have the time to put the effort in, but it is an area where government&mdash;of whichever persuasion after the next election&mdash;needs to put increasing emphasis on creating the environment, and particularly with micro-economic reform, to enable some of those smaller companies to take advantage of these tremendous APEC opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate of Aston, a company called GCD International Pty Ltd recently won the national export award. A company called Decor Corporation Pty Ltd exports regularly. Another company called Kenman Kandy Pty Ltd is getting all of its market growth from export activity, because the market at home is pretty stable. We are about to announce a new export award citation for another company in my electorate that is in the macadamia nut chocolates business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I just want to say that I welcome the Prime Minister's statement. The coalition certainly takes a bipartisan view. There are a number of challenges for us to create an environment at home that will allow Australian companies to take advantage of the opportunities in APEC, but I certainly commend the statement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APEC experiment is the product of three major heads of government meetings in Seattle, Bogor and Osaka. Next year the meeting will be at Subic Bay, in the Philippines. APEC has been based on the very simple principle that open markets generate growth. Whether we are talking about labour markets, capital markets or any other form of markets for goods and services, the important thing is that we must have the capacity in this country to serve the region, which is, in economic terms, burgeoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now 18 APEC signatories; they represent over two billion people, virtually half the world's population. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, that represents 60 per cent of the world's entire gross domestic product. In that context, the last conference in Osaka did have some very notable achievements. The most important single concrete achievement was that down payments have been made by both Japan and China&mdash;in one case, the world's premier market; in the other case, undoubtedly the world's largest growing market&mdash;toward the liberalisation of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes were substantial. Consequently, they are but part of a total scene which we have seen developing over recent years. It has now reached the stage where we have some 700 Japanese imports and over 4,000 Chinese imports, representing a reduction of some 30 per cent in tariffs, which have been affected by the decisions taken at Osaka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is only one of a number of dynamics at work in East Asia and across the Pacific&mdash;the most notable is the development of NAFTA&mdash;but nevertheless it is in that environment that we have to see Australia's relations with the individual markets within the region, all of which are members of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious market of interest to us, apart from China and Japan, is Indonesia. It will be the fifth largest world market quite early in the next century. Consequently, the cooperation which the President of Indonesia, General Suharto, has given to the Australian government in achieving not only the outcomes of Bogor but also those of Osaka demonstrates the depth of the relationship which is being created with Indonesia, despite the constant bilateral difficulties which will probably continue to one degree or another well into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately for Australia, the East Asian economies as a whole believe in the liberalisation of trade, and they believe it is good for their economies. That has been no more clearly demonstrated than by the fact that at Osaka it was possible, despite the problems of Japanese primary industry&mdash;as demonstrated also by some concerns shown by China, Malaysia and others&mdash;that all those countries were prepared to work together to achieve the overall objective that by the year 2010 all developed countries will have reduced their trade barriers, and by 2020 the developing world will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various commentators have been cynical about the conference, asking: what does it really mean? Is there a definition of free trade which is acceptable to all the members of APEC? The reality suggests that there probably is not. Nevertheless these steps have been taken and they are significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we should be wise to the reality of diplomacy and of international trade. The Malaysian Minister for International Trade and Industry, Mrs Rafidah Aziz, said:</PARA>

<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be very careful not to allow our imaginations to run ahead of the reality, which will change from time to time. Nevertheless, an objective has been set and accepted by all 18 signatory members. It is, naturally, the responsibility of Australia to make sure that it is fully carried through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty of maintaining the United States of America's interest in the Asia-Pacific region is something of profound importance to Australia's foreign policy, as well as to our trade policy. In fact, one of the most important things that APEC can do is ensure that American attention is focused on what is really happening in East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's down payment, to which I referred, should bring it closer to membership of the World Trade Organisation, from which it has been excluded. Nevertheless, there is a major problem in the relationship between China and the United States.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is already spearheading moves for the new World Trade Organisation's global round of trade liberalisation.

Nevertheless, the status of Australia within the region and in our bilateral relationships with those APEC members leaves us very little room for complacency, either about the future of the organisation or about our bilateral links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to the question of a secure framework within which Australia can look to its regional economic future. Each one of those members will ultimately be making decisions which are of political and economic benefit to itself. The genius of APEC will depend on how the commonality of interest can be harnessed for the betterment of the entire region. That is why there is broad support for the 2010 and 2020 plans for regional trade liberalisation. But we must not lose sight of the fact that, ultimately, there is no way to compel APEC members to meet those targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are internal conflicts within the structure of APEC which could threaten its cohesion in the future. There are conflicts over trade between the United States and Japan, conflicts between the United States and China&mdash;to which I have referred&mdash;and conflicts between South Korea, Japan and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Malaysia's continuing campaign to deny Australia a place in Asia, and their emphasis on the establishment of their rival organisation&mdash;or sub-rival organisation&mdash;called the EAEC. Perhaps the retirement of Prime Minister Mahathir will see a new dawn in Australia's relations with Malaysia. Nevertheless, in the context of ASEAN, Australia is not seen as one of them. That is going to continue to be a problem in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the celebrated diplomat and statesman Henry Kissinger said he had observed that market economic systems were efficient for increasing gross national product, but wondered whether they closed the gap between rich and poor sufficiently to ensure political stability in societies. We must never lose sight of the fact that, for many Asian nations, political and social stability are still important considerations. They transcend their economic development. In other words, they are willing to trade off some economic efficiency, provided it gives them political stability which then reduces the vulnerability of governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most booming Asian economies&mdash;apart from Singapore and Hong Kong&mdash;governments still exercise wide economic influence which they are reluctant to relinquish. That is why it is important in the context of APEC that we maintain the structure of heads of government meetings. It is not a case of advice permeating up but a case of policy initiatives permeating down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should also beware of assuming that APEC is the only economic game in the region, or for that matter in the world. We could well be deluding ourselves that the East Asian economic caucus promoted by Mohamad Mahathir is an unimportant subgroup. That was emphasised clearly by the fact that he has been able to promote the EAEC as the true Asian economic voice and to exclude Australia, the United States and New Zealand. While he has tried to get Japan into their membership, that is not absolutely clear. The important thing is that we have been denied a place at the first Asian-European union summit next March in Bangkok, which should demonstrate that the significance of Australia in the region is not always seen from the north in the same light as it is seen from the south. We should be very conscious of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EAEC's viability as a separate entity from APEC should safeguard its relations with Europe. That is part of the Mahathir plan. But the Europeans now see the development of Asia as of profound importance for the next stage of their development in the context of the European Community. Again Australia has to be in a position where we can deal with both the European group and the Asian group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my concluding remarks I want to draw attention to the fact that I believe the time has now come for the next major set of reforms in the APEC context. Till now, APEC has been essentially an economic entity and very little attention has been given to the fact that, at the ministerial level, there are also many meetings taking place on a host of other quasi-economic issues involving social development, education and financial matters; a host of cooperative ventures have been developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weakness we have in the APEC context is that there is not yet in place a mechanism by which there is a capacity for the populations of the region to feel associated with the product of APEC. In that context I put forward the proposition, which I hope will be furthered at Subic Bay, that, just as the Europeans had a Council of Europe and now have a European Parliament, the first steps should be taken toward ensuring that in the Asia-Pacific region there is a similar representative body for the parliaments of the region, able to make a contribution to the APEC process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, in this parliament, I suggested that the time had come for Australia to take a role in the establishment of a parliamentary Asia-Pacific forum. I prepared the first discussion paper which was considered at the Singapore meeting. With the close cooperation of the Japanese, in particular the former Prime Minister, Mr Nakasone, Australia and Japan have been the two pillars upon which the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum have been built. But there are still difficulties in getting the APPF structure&mdash;which has 25 members, some of whom are not members of APEC&mdash;into the position where it can have a logical working framework within the APEC process and give it a much wider base. The 1992 Tokyo declaration establishing the APPF described its objectives as identifying and discussing matters of common concern and interest and highlighting them in a global context; deepening the understanding of the parliaments of the region, of policy concerns, of interests and experiences of individual countries and what they have learnt; examining the critical political, social, cultural, economic and defence relationships and linkages resulting from economic growth and integration; encouraging and promoting regional cooperation at all levels in matters of common concern to the region; and playing the role of national parliamentarians in furthering, in their respective countries, a sense of regional cohesion, understanding and cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Tokyo meeting there have been meetings in the Philippines and in Mexico, and the next meeting is set down for January 1996, in Thailand. The forum is effective. It should be the future voice of the people of the region, working closely with APEC to ensure a safe and secure world for us all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
