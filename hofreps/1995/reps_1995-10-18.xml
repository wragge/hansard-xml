<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . do minorities matter? Have we reverted to Germany in the 1930s? I think of Australia as a liberal democracy where minorities matter and will be protected. These people would get a better deal if they were native flora and fauna.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know the fate of Sydenham and we know that minorities do not matter to this government, even if they are overwhelmingly Labor supporters. These last weeks have seen a shocking spectacle of the former community of Sydenham being destroyed by bulldozers&mdash;a tight-knit community, with many who have lived there all their lives, smashed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment it is only 112 houses, but even now it is affecting much wider areas. Small businesses are collapsing, surrounding residential areas are degrading and no repairs or renewals are possible. The only possible buyer is the Commonwealth. Individual lives and the community's social structure have been destroyed. Bitter people are condemned to a decaying, disintegrating neighbourhood and have been lied to for years by those who are publicly paid to protect them and look after their interests. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> revealed in an article on 14 October 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that as many as five years ago the then New South Wales government was paying a public relations firm, Hill &amp; Knowlton, to devise a campaign to persuade Sydney people to back the second parallel runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The secret strategy included focusing on talk-back radio hosts, making sure they were supplied with briefing kits which rebutted all the environmental and social arguments against the runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Canberra press gallery were also targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a letter dated February 16, 1990, detailing his progress to officials in the Department of State Development, Alex Paton from Hill &amp; Knowlton reported: "I believe most of the reporters down there (meaning Canberra) are `on side' and are in support of our standing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very encouraging to hear.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an appalling indictment of government in this country&mdash;and, I must say, the media, which were almost universally in favour of the third runway before it opened. But all this public manipulation and displacement of people around the airport has been going on for 40 years. It is just that it has been slower and less dramatic than the present crisis brought on by the third runway. In future this bill will ensure that the same thing will happen at Kurnell, Marrickville and many other places to a lesser or greater degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have it&mdash;low income housing relentlessly destroyed after 40 years and this is set to continue into the future, all consciously decided by a Labor government led by a minister who is primarily concerned with and indeed outraged by a possible threat to the continuation of this process and, in his own words, `inconveniencing foreign investors'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1945 the airport has been one of the major causes of the loss of over a quarter of a million inner Sydney residents&mdash;a huge economic and social cost recognised and established in countless state and federal reports for well over 20 years but never sheeted home to the airport. Never at any stage have state or federal governments quantified this massive cost, preferring to allow it to be a secret subsidy to the airlines. The fact is that, if it had ever been quantified and charged, the airport could not have remained at Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing demonstrates the stranglehold that private interests have on governments in Australia better than this, and the fact that the third runway could proceed on top of all the massive expenditure of public money in past expansions without any cost-benefit studies. Instead, this bill not only continues the process but also effectively shuts forever the long-term objective of redeveloping the airport site and the surrounding areas, even in the event of a horrific air crash killing hundreds of people, except by massive compensation to private companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the bill envisages is a continuation of the expansion of urban blight&mdash;a continuation of a subsidy to the airlines by taxpayer expenditure for airport related infrastructure many kilometres from the airport funded by ratepayers, state taxpayers and Australian taxpayers. The bill not only entrenches the enormous subsidy of a huge area of free land in the heart of Sydney but also ignores the opportunity of redeveloping the 30 square kilometres or so around the airport which is occupied by airport related infrastructure, storage areas and wasteland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also ignores the massive loss of property values that Sydney residents have borne in the past, bear in the present and will bear in the future. Everything up to 14 kilometres, and more in some cases, is affected and in all directions, irrespective of the relief given by the effective closure of the east-west runway. The threat is always there, and not only existing residents are affected. It will affect all types of urban development into the long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By an irony, one of the loudest voices in Sydney in the 1980s on the need to construct the third runway was the head of a Sydney tourism task force, Mr Syd Londish. Mr Londish was extremely vocal until it became obvious that a multi-million dollar development with which he was associated at Pulpit Point, Hunters Hill, lay directly on the centre line of the third runway. The development never achieved anticipated sales because of the then threat of the runway and was, I have no doubt, a factor in the large scale collapse of Mr Londish's enterprises. In the face of all this, how can the government continue to parade this bill as a great micro-economic reform when it is in fact an economic disaster?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation, since it was commissioned in 1986, has proved the dangers of corporatisation and senior executives of supposedly publicly owned organisations losing any sense of public purpose. It, like many other public corporations such as the CAA, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Qantas, soon became a self-serving organisation shamelessly lying to the public and using public funds for its own and private purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there is some evidence that within its narrow scale of values it was an efficient operator of airports. A Travers Morgan study of over 40 major international airports showed that Sydney airport landing and associated charges were the fourth lowest of the airports studied. Additionally, a study by a United Kingdom expert showed that, compared with United Kingdom and European airports, the FAC's productivity is significantly higher while unit operating costs are proportionally lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While most of this is based on commissioned studies and self-assertions by the FAC itself, and therefore of doubtful veracity, there is enough evidence to suggest that there is no substantial gain to be made from privatisation which could even fractionally justify the economic and environmental disaster that the bill proposes for the future. While there is no question that many aspects of airport operations can be contracted out to a great extent, that is no excuse for the wholesale privatisation and almost total loss of public control envisaged in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that the minister has dwelt on the extensive but private consultations he has had with potential investors for the airport. He is vitally concerned that they might be `inconvenienced'. But where is there any consultation with the residents of Sydney? What about their `inconvenience'? Where is there any consultation with local government bodies affected by the airport, or the many resident organisations or the Australian Mayoral Aviation Council? The latter organisation has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation, which has had no real or effective community consultation process, has serious failings in that it does not address controls on aircraft noise, airport air quality, non-related airport development, airport related traffic management, waste water disposal, waste material disposal, curfew management or the ex-gratia payment of rate equivalents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporate sector was given the opportunity to discuss drafts of the privatisation legislation, local communities and local government were not.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such actions beg the questions of what needed to be hidden from those communities most directly affected by any action on airports.</PARA>
<PARA>If the serious issues we have referred to above are not resolved, Australian airports could be privatised without any real safeguards for local communities. If this happens, profit would be paramount and the interests of residents would come a poor and distant second&mdash;a very accurate understatement. Frankly, it is actions like this that have given the minister the worst public reputation of any politician in living memory in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendments&mdash;given the opposition's consistent support over many years for the expansion of the Sydney airport, the third runway and privatisation&mdash;can only be regarded as unprincipled electoral opportunism. Nevertheless, they are all that residents of Sydney can cling to, even though the opposition ignores most of the real issues and holds out only a temporary palliative. Those amendments also embody the cruel deception that there is any real solution by air traffic management. There is none in the long term; 50 years of mismanagement at Mascot has put paid to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future is grim for the people of Sydney and for people near airports around Australia. The opposition may or may not block the government's plans in the Senate until the election. But after the election, even in the unlikely event of a government win, the airlines will soon subvert the Senate, just as they will in the event of a coalition government. Either way, both parties are committed to privatisation. There is therefore, as I said in the debate on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, no hope for any real solution in the long-term future, except by eventual redevelopment of Sydney airport&mdash;an option which is removed by privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of Sydney will have no alternative but to mount a campaign of such ferocity as to deter any intending purchaser. They do not share the minister's concern about `inconveniencing foreign investors'. This is an appalling prospect, opening up an endless and destructive war of civil disobedience, endless legal actions, ever more disruption of airline services and further millions of taxpayers' dollars wasted. Many will chose to cut their losses and move, leaving Sydney a degraded monument to this government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Kingsford-Smith-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (9.47 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would just say something about the contribution of the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), the last speaker in this debate. In terms of historic position regarding the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport, I must say that in the 1970s and 1980s, when I was one of those campaigning with a good deal of energy to see a second airport built for Sydney rather than the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport with parallel runways, the honourable member's protestations were somewhat muted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the honourable member was preoccupied with fighting his great campaign to prevent the construction of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel&mdash;a project which he railed against for years, using many of the expressions he has used today in respect of what he calls the destructive effect of Kingsford Smith airport upon the urban environment of Sydney. I am still waiting for him to square away the results of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. I think he is possibly the only person who at this stage has failed to admit that that tunnel has been a great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean to say that, in terms of airports, the honourable member and I do not share a good deal of the same concerns about protecting Sydney residents from the impact of airport noise. It is for that reason that the government, through this leasing process, has been committed to the development of the second airport for Sydney: an airport at Badgerys Creek, an airport funded through the bills before the parliament at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An airport at Badgerys Creek will finally deliver an alternative to Kingsford Smith so that, in the years to come, all the planes wanting to land at and take off from what is the gateway to Australia will not be totally restricted to Kingsford Smith. Therefore, that growth that has been such a factor of the noise nuisance will have somewhere else to go. It is that alternative location which is being frustrated by the approach that the opposition have indicated they will adopt; that is, they will pursue, with their numbers in the Senate, the rejection of this legislation until such time as they can have their crazy way regarding the reopening of the east-west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In summarising for the government and in responding to the second reading debate, it is fair to say that the government's proposals for the leasing and the regulation of federal airports are acknowledged to be a really excellent way to introduce further innovation and benchmark competition into Australian airports. The government will, accordingly, have no part in cooperating with the opposition in allowing this legislation to be hijacked, especially when the hijacking of it involves such a cynical political stunt as is being attempted by the opposition in this debate. That is what their proposed amendments amount to&mdash;nothing short of a cynical political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have said during the debate that they support the sale of the FAC airports, yet they are proposing amendments which, if accepted, would stop the process and stop it in its very tracks; they would prevent it from going ahead. Their contribution to the technical nature of the debate is really notable&mdash;because it has been a lack of contribution. Nothing of substance in terms of the technical nature of the legislation has been put forward by the opposition. We know that the shadow minister is not exactly renowned for her grip on policy, but she has truly excelled herself in this debate. I think she has probably even outdone Senator Parer for adopting views on aviation that are pre the Wright brothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view we have to assume that, owing to the lack of serious amendments, the opposition either do not understand the legislation or, alternatively, cannot find any serious fault with it. It may be that given the political nature of their amendments they have not bothered to read or carefully study the legislation. Judging by the standard of the amendments, I think it is more likely that they have read their tea-leaves. Linking the legislation with Sydney's east-west runway represents the most spurious of all of the opposition amendments. The operation of the airport runways has absolutely nothing to do with the regulatory provisions of the Airports Bill&mdash;nothing whatsoever. This legislation relates to the leasing of airports run by the FAC, and the FAC has never been the agency that controls runway operations. I think the opposition stand condemned in the eyes of every economic commentator and every business leader as a  result of the sheer irresponsibility of the course of action that they have adopted in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to say something about the east-west runway, because the operations of the runways at Kingsford Smith airport, and indeed the operations of the runways at most of the FAC airports, are determined strictly on the safety advice that is tendered to the government by the air traffic control agencies. It is very serious advice because each day these controllers, these expert safety advisers, have the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians in their hands. It is a terribly serious business. I know that Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation are very stringent and very rigorous in the standards that they set. They have legislation that imposes upon them a duty as regulators, and it is a duty that under this legislation will continue to apply post leasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of these agencies has demonstrated very clearly that the regular use of the east-west runway would be inherently less safe&mdash;inherently less safe because it involves intersecting operations as opposed to parallel runways where there is no intersection. In addition, they have indicated that it is less efficient than parallel operations. That is a view that has not only been expressed by all of the regulatory agencies but also supported by independent safety experts, by the major Australian airlines and by the advisers to the major Australian airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are people of qualification, of huge daily responsibility. Every minister has no option but to be guided by these safety experts. Of course, in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is saying that he knows more about aviation safety and aviation operations than Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation or, for that matter, the Department of Transport. This is the same opposition leader who yesterday falsely alleged that the government was orchestrating the blockade of Western Australia and is now seeking to orchestrate a less safe method of operating Sydney airport. Why? All because of concern over the real headland that is near and dear to his heart&mdash;the headland from Hunters Hill down to Woolwich in his electorate of Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly no concern about passenger safety in what he is proposing and what the opposition are proposing. Likewise, there is a complete disregard for the taxpayers who would find that the capacity, and hence the value, of Sydney airport would be slashed if we adopted the opposition amendment&mdash;slashed completely. Airservices Australia, in its expert evidence, has said that the cut in capacity could be as great as 35 per cent. Sure, you can make intersecting runways operate safely but you have to slash capacity to do it. There is no way you can operate that airport at the capacity it is designed for and operate it safely at the same time. One or other will go, and in this case both will go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So safety is reduced and operational capacity is reduced. Why? Because of the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of his seat of Bennelong, after his lifetime of support for the construction of the parallel runway system&mdash;every one of his constituents knows it&mdash;where he acknowledged again and again that expansion of the airport would involve a north-south axis with an elimination of traffic on the east-west runway. That is an acknowledgment he made and it is an acknowledgment inherent in all of the submissions of the New South Wales government, which were the other great proponents of the expansion of Sydney airport with the parallel runway configuration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of all this, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition, in pursuit of his sneaky and unscrupulous agenda, prepared to use the parliamentary process to hold a gun at the government's head unless we agree to reject the advice tendered to us by all the safety regulators. There is an old saying about never giving in to a hijacker. Certainly, the government will not be giving in to the opposition in their attempts to hijack this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about the leasing strategy. We intend to stick to that strategy. The leasing strategy involves the simultaneous sale of the four major airports with cross-ownership restrictions on Sydney and Brisbane, as well as Sydney and Melbourne. That strategy is vital to the airport proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acceptance of the opposition's amendments to exclude Sydney and Sydney West would destroy the strategy. It would cut the level of bidder interest in each of the major airports and significantly reduce budget revenues. The fact is that no bidders will put forward their best bid for a lesser asset if that precludes them&mdash;they would be precluded under the cross-ownership arrangement&mdash;from subsequently bidding for Kingsford Smith. That is why the opposition's proposal to exclude Sydney from the first tranche is nothing short of economic voodooism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be made to work because you cannot sell the lesser assets&mdash;assets worth a quarter or a third of the major asset&mdash;to bidders who would find themselves precluded from bidding for the principal asset. Over the next several months, when the opposition have to explain away their position to the business community of this country&mdash;explain away their total irresponsibility&mdash;that will be the major problem they face because every economic commentator, every expert financial adviser, knows that you cannot go down this track without putting Sydney in the first tranche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney is the FAC's most valuable and attractive asset. It is the key element in the leasing strategy. That key element has been determined on the basis of expert financial and commercial advice. Of course, here again the opposition says, `We know all the advisers. We know more on safety than CASA, Airservices Australia, BASI, the Department of Transport, Qantas and Ansett. On financial matters we know more than BZW. We know more than all the bidders.' These bidders, I might say, comprise all the major financial institutions in this country. All of them have given me the same advice: you must put Sydney in the first tranche. But the opposition know better. They know better on safety and they know better on finance! Actually, they know better on nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, with these cross-ownership restrictions in place, bidders will not bid for any other airport where that restricts their ability to bid for Sydney. Certainly they are going to be unable to settle their bidding strategies if Sydney is excluded&mdash;absolutely unable to settle their bidding strategies. That is why this is such an act of financial vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any delay in the leasing of Sydney airport therefore compromises the whole sales process and it would be completely negligent of any government to accept the opposition's amendments. The opposition's seriously proposing that we excise Sydney from the process shows that you certainly would not want them as your real estate agents. You would not want the opposition handling the sale of any property. They would be struck off the register very quickly for ripping off their clients&mdash;in this case, of course, the Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further product of deferring Sydney is the destruction of the timetable for the construction of Sydney West airport, which is absolutely dependent for its cash flow on funds coming from the privatisation of Sydney airport and the ability of the new lessee of Sydney airport to raise further funds for Sydney West as a result of being able to impose charges on users at Sydney airport to fund the infrastructure at Sydney West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the whole tight timetable&mdash;it is an extremely tight timetable, but one that is manageable&mdash;of completing Sydney West in time for the year 2000 Olympics is being derailed by the opposition, wrecked by the opposition, as a result of this financial irresponsibility and this logistic irresponsibility for the sake of a few lousy votes in the seat of the member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say something about Adelaide airport. The government has carefully negotiated with the South Australian government a project that is vital to Adelaide's economy; that is, the upgrading of the runways at Adelaide airport. It is part of our overall government commitment to transport development in that state&mdash;developments, I can say, that include the Mount Barker road and the One Nation standard gauge rail highway. We are very proud of the trifecta of developments: the Mount Barker road, the One Nation standard gauge and the Adelaide airport expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's amendments, which propose the inclusion of Adelaide in the first stage sales, stem from their embarrassment over John Olsen's public criticism of their cynical decision to block this legislation. Yet he, and the whole of South Australia, needs to know that the opposition's amendments would not be a shot in the arm for South Australia but would be a stab in the back for South Australia and for the interests of Adelaide. They have virtually put an end to the plans at this stage for a runway extension at Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adelaide does not need to be leased tomorrow. Indeed, what Adelaide needs is to be extended tomorrow. The extension of Adelaide tomorrow comes from Sydney airport and the funding  of it comes from the leasing of Sydney airport. But, of course, no, that plan, like Sydney West, is wrecked by the opposition approach. By blocking the proceeds of the sale at Sydney, proceeds required to fund the Commonwealth's contribution to the runways and other works at Adelaide, they would prevent the Adelaide runway improvements. That is the double bunger effect with Sydney West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That can only add up to a huge king hit&mdash;a king hit for the battlers of western Sydney and a king hit for the battlers of Adelaide. Lord only knows, Adelaide is the last group of people who should be bearing this burden and this further setback. This is not the first Liberal leader of late to stab the people of Adelaide in the back. The last one was Premier Kennett in Victoria over the Grand Prix. Now it is John Howard at a federal level. Why? For the burghers of Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government took account of the commercial advice that there was a danger that offering other airports such as Adelaide in the first phase could result in a poor investor interest in these airports when the focus of investors would be on bidding for the majors. It would not serve South Australia's regional interests well. I repeat: what Adelaide needs is the runway extension; it does not need to be privatised tomorrow. In fact, privatising it will not see the runway extended at all. We propose to extend it and then to privatise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, the effect of the opposition's proposals would put all of the aspirations of those cities for their airports on hold. Without Sydney and Sydney West included in the first stage, the government would not be able responsibly to proceed with leasehold sales of these airports by the end of 1996 as is currently planned. So Sydney, Sydney West, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane are all on hold and the extension of Adelaide airport is on hold. Well, congratulations! You are a real brilliant lot, indeed. </PARA>

As far as possible, the government will progress the work necessary, to the extent that we can, to prepare the airports for sale, despite this financially irresponsible behaviour by the opposition. No-one should be in any doubt that effectively the opposition is putting on hold the aspirations of Brisbane, Sydney, Sydney West, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. It is putting them on hold, wrecking that development in Adelaide and wrecking the opportunity of having a second airport available at Badgerys Creek in time for the year 2000 Olympics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some observations about the amendments with regard to the position at Badgerys Creek airport and interests in western and south-western Sydney. One thing about this debate is that it has flushed out the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and exposed their lack of skill and lack of capacity as policy makers in this very important area of airport administration. Let us examine their statements on the public record. Let us expose the inconsistencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition are campaigning in eastern Sydney for the seats of Lowe and Bennelong, they say two things. The first thing they say&mdash;it is reflected in the amendments&mdash;is that they want to reopen the east-west runway and that they will hold up this legislation until such time as it happens. The second thing they say in the seats of Lowe and Bennelong is that they want to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport. The Leader of the Opposition went as far as to say that he would redirect all the international traffic to Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those two statements in themselves are inconsistent. You cannot fast-track Badgerys Creek airport without money. You cannot fast-track the airport at Sydney West without the finance. And the finance for that proposition, for that construction project, is contained in the legislation, in the private leasing of Kingsford Smith. So the opposition cannot have it both ways. They should not be going to the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong making statements and policies which are totally inconsistent; they are mutually exclusive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets worse. When they come to campaign in south-western Sydney in the seat of Macarthur, the opposition say they are in favour of a comprehensive EIS on the construction of Badgerys Creek airport. That begs the question: how long does it take to undertake the EIS on Badgerys Creek? It is a period of two to three years. A comprehensive EIS on Badgerys Creek for the construction of the new airport would take between two to three years. So how do the opposition reconcile that with their statement in the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong in east Sydney that they are in favour of fast-tracking Badgerys Creek? Do they mean fast-tracking Badgerys Creek with a two- to three-year delay?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This again exposes the complete inconsistency in the policies of the opposition. They have been exposed because they are trying to straddle the divide of east and west Sydney. They are doing it with no concern for rational policy and no concern for good policy making. This is total and complete electoral opportunism, all driven by the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition for his own seat and base concerns about his prospects in Lowe in east Sydney and Macarthur in south-west Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least we have seen from this debate and some of the policy that the opposition have brought forward how unsatisfactory they are as policy makers. They are totally inconsistent and totally exposed throughout the course of this debate. I am sure it is a healthy process for the press gallery and for the public at large throughout the country to look at what the opposition is doing on airport policy just in Sydney itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business of reopening the east-west runway and fast-tracking Badgerys Creek is totally impossible under the terms of the amendment moved by the member for Mackellar. She somehow has a belief that it is possible to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport without money; that it is possible to build a billion dollar facility without finance. She needs to explain to the people of Australia, to the people of Sydney, how she would fast-track Badgerys Creek without the proceeds of private leasing of Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the member for Mackellar: where is the money coming from to build Badgerys Creek airport if you are going to delay indefinitely the proceeds of the private leasing of Kingsford Smith? When you next enter the electorate of Macarthur with your copilot, the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, how will you explain to the electorate the inconsistency of wanting to not only fast-track Badgerys Creek airport but also have an EIS? It is not possible. It is totally impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least we have seen out of this debate the real fabric, the real quality, of the opposition on airport policy. It is a sign of things to come as they release other policies closer to the election. They too will lack any substance, any capacity and some of the core elements of public policy making in Australia in the 1990s. So it has been good, it has been enlightening, to flush out the Leader of the Opposition and his copilot `Wrong way Bishop' on all these issues and to expose the inconsistencies for what they are&mdash;completely unacceptable, completely opportunistic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very nice of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to pop in every now and again and  have a little vitriolic bleed for the morning.  He does not add usefully to the debate. I might go back to the question of safety, which the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) raised. I was quoting from Mr W. Pollard, the chief executive officer designate of Airservices Australia, whom the minister cited in his speech as supporting his case. His first honest, straightforward comments were these:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the world and in my past experience, there are many airports that have intersecting runways and they are used quite safely. In fact, many airports do not have parallel runways but usually have one north-south and one east-west and many times they are intersecting and it is done safely.</PARA>
<PARA>The Regional Airlines Association of Australia pointed out the danger that occurs in the air with intersecting aircraft. Its comment was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the east-west runway was used to interleave aircraft arrivals and departures, it would be far safer than the major congestion caused when arrivals are occurring from the north, as aircraft from the south and west are approaching Sydney airport currently intersect in the air with aircraft arriving from the north.</PARA>
<PARA>The question of safety is one, as I have said before, that the minister simply wants to confuse and abuse the people who are affected by the noise about and will not address the factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested that the minister in his summary of the second reading failed to address any of the points that I raised in my speech in the second reading debate which were gained from consultation.

Indeed, he pointed out that the minister was partly responsible for the loss of government under Unsworth and that he is the most unpopular minister that Sydney has ever seen. </PARA>

This is from the same party, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) pointed out, that released 100,000 building sites, including land owned by Lady Mary Fairfax, in the western suburbs of Sydney. There could be nothing more destructive to the environment than doing that. The big difference in Badgerys Creek is that the closest significant housing is some 14 klicks away from the airport. In the western suburbs of Sydney, if the opposition want to play fast and loose on Badgerys Creek, ordinary people will see through it. They won't fall for it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to continue with the point so ably raised by my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). He talked about the sorts of management practices that this government has presided over. He mentioned the fact that aircraft are required to come into Mascot at 3,000 feet above sea level. They are then sent over the loop, which he showed very ably on his map, that began after the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) introduced his so-called noise abatement program. Those aircraft are sent at 3,000 feet above sea level over the whole of the North Shore, parts of which are up to 1,000 feet above sea level. Therefore, the height that those planes fly over at 80 per cent power is almost intolerable.</PARA></TALK.START>

The point of the matter is that the minister deliberately instructed, deliberately oversaw, the change of patterns of landings and take-offs. Landings in particular are causing enormous concern for health, for quality of life and for valuation of property. It is quite deliberate. We can see from the comparison of maps that once upon a time there used to be a fanning out that was reasonable. Now it is all the Bennelong funnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not acceptable for the minister to try to say that he has no intention of doing anything about this problem and to say that there will be consequences that will flow from our amendments to the timetable of the privatisation.

It's not my problem.' Wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to briefly refer to a couple of matters raised by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in this debate relating to safety and whether one should operate three runways or two at Sydney airport. The important thing to remember is what the government has been trying to do with Sydney airport&mdash;that is, to ensure that there is a safe operation at the airport, that the asset that the public has gets a good value when sold, that Sydney stays as the major international gateway to Australia and that we try to contain some of the noise around the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell says that it was always envisaged that Sydney would operate with three runways rather than two. I just do not think that is quite right. Indeed, the honourable member for Mitchell&mdash;who has only taken a cursory interest in this matter from time to time&mdash;might be aware that, in the planning stages when the FAC was putting out models of what the new airport was going to look like, the models in fact had buildings where the cross-runway is. So it was obviously never the FAC's intention to run Sydney airport with three runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the member for Mitchell had taken more than a cursory interest in this matter he would also have known that the environmental approval for Sydney airport was on the basis that it would run as a parallel runway operation airport. The only time the east-west runway was to be used was if there were adverse weather conditions. It was never envisaged that it would run two north-south runways in conjunction with the east-west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the evidence that has been supplied is that to run intersecting runways is inherently less safe than to run parallel runways. Even the member for Mitchell might be able to understand&mdash;although I know it is a pretty difficult concept for someone like him to get a handle on&mdash;that if two things are running at right angles to each other, they might actually run into each other, while if they were running parallel to each other, they would not run into each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old Simops system which used to operate at Sydney airport is unsafe. To run Sydney airport with three runways is not as safe as running it with two runways. That is an undeniable fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell and the shadow minister&mdash;who both profess wanting to do something for the community&mdash;should also take account of the fact that if you reopen the east-west runway at Sydney airport you actually create noise pollution over another 58,000 people. That means that you would have a much noisier operation at Sydney airport than you have there now. More people would be affected and there would be more difficulty in operating the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's proposition is a silly one. They are coming in here and telling half truths. The reality is that with the proposals the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has put forward, the people in Sydney get a good deal out of this. With the change in the flight paths, the minister has ensured that fewer people are affected. With the sharper take-offs he has ensured that fewer people are affected. For the first time we have a minister who is trying to do something to alleviate the pain of people who live around Sydney airport. </PARA>

That is a shameful position for a senior member of the opposition to take. The member for Mackellar and her copilot, the Leader of the Opposition, when they campaign in the south-west of Sydney and the seat of Macarthur, say they want a comprehensive EIS at Badgerys Creek which would involve a two- or three-year delay. Her interpretation of fast tracking is to build a two- to three-year delay into the process. This really is low grade stuff. This is low level flying in every sense. In the consistency and in the substance of this debate I would have thought it would be clear to anyone listening to the discussion or reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at a subsequent date that Labor has been consistent on this matter and the Opposition has been a shameful, inconsistent fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to conclude my remarks in this debate by saying something about Badgerys Creek. The fact is that Badgerys Creek airport will go ahead and it will be a significant economic generator. It took effort from everybody&mdash;local government, state government and federal government representatives&mdash;to convince the minister at the table and the FAC that the runway should be at least capable of handling jumbo jets. That was not the government's original intention and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) knows that. It still is not adequate. In the process of financing and generating activity, the government has decided to use taxpayers' funds through the FAC. It has been the preferred position of local governments, elected members of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party from western Sydney to use a mixture of private funds and government funds, perhaps drawing in elements of local government and representatives of the community to construct a truly local international airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard has not endorsed the use of Badgerys Creek as Sydney's international airport. You cannot keep misrepresenting him in that way. That is not a fact. As to the progress at Badgerys Creek, I put the minister on notice that western Sydney residents are becoming very concerned about the lack of action and communication by your government. In the last month there has been an effort by some of your members and you to restore that situation. You need to do a whole heap more than you are doing. There are pockets of resistance rising up because people do not know what the flight paths are going to be. They cannot understand what the ultimate resolution of this problem will be. It is time for you to get out there&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister can say what he likes but I have here a time flow chart, and none of this is yet under way. Yet you are putting out statements around western Sydney that the tractors will roll at the beginning of March. The EIS is not supposed to be finished until the end of July next year. Are you going to start construction before the EIS is finished? Are you saying that the EIS you are doing is just a facade and an update of what has already been done? Of course you are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You intend to have, through the community consultations, the negotiations, the EIS and the whole construction of the infrastructure, token consultation. You are not going to do a real job on this; you are going to push ahead because you have a problem down at Mascot. You are not going to treat the people of the west any better than you did when you were in the state government. Your view of Sydney, from those salubrious buildings bordering Sydney Harbour, stretched as far as Drummoyne, as being the western suburbs. I think it is time that you communicated effectively with people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Olympic Games are coming up. The pressure from the people of western Sydney is to have this airport finished by the year 2000. Your parliamentary secretary says it will be finished late in 1999. Every expert says that that is an impossibility, that you are not going to hit that target. That is a gross overstatement. Don't you think the unions will screw you when they know you're on such a short timetable? Do you think you will satisfy the needs of Sydney and the Olympic Games by not connecting rail to it? Are you going to force people onto more road transport? What do you, as Minister for Transport, really stand for? You have got no environmental aspects in all of this. This was going to be the environmental Olympic Games, yet you ask people to depend on road transport for their communications. Where is the planning that you are espousing for Badgerys Creek?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation needs to be held up until you make a decision to open the east-west runway. In so doing, I hope you will clarify your lack of commitment, lack of planning, lack of consultation with the people of western Sydney, so that they understand what you are doing, they are properly consulted, environmental studies are done and footprints are generated. In that way, people will know how they are going to be affected, where they are going to be affected and whether any measures need to be undertaken by you&mdash;and this bill gives you that power&mdash;to soundproof, insulate or buy property which is severely affected by noise pollution. This is a great amendment and I believe, minister, that you should support it. </PARA>

Let me repeat the question for the member for Mackellar, whom I invite to give an answer which is so important to the people I represent: do you want Badgerys Creek fast-tracked and, if so, how will you pay for it, or do you want a new EIS, which will delay the process for two to three years? That is a key question fundamental to the coming election campaign and the policy positions that both parties will be taking throughout greater western Sydney and all the key seats in the region.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 19, page 9, add at the end of the clause:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(g)Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and Sydney West Airport must not be specified in the regulations unless a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place to share more equitably the aircraft noise burden over Sydney, in particular, the resumption of full operation of the East-West runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, has been laid before the Senate and the House of Representatives and approved by resolution of each House.".</PARA>
<PARA>These amendments are in line with the amendments I moved earlier to the Airports Bill to excise Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I now propose, similarly, to excise the references to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport from the Airports (Transitional) Bill so as to effect the postponement of the privatisation until such time as the noise burden over Sydney is dealt with in a more equitable manner&mdash;in particular, until the resumption of the full operation of the east-west runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed in this set of amendments that the Adelaide airport be added to the list in clause 19 of the Airports (Transitional) Bill so that the provisions of that bill will apply to Adelaide airport forthwith. The reason for that amendment is to give effect to our belief that Adelaide airport ought to be treated like the other mainland capital city state airport and be in the first phase of sales of the Federal Airports Corporation. The current legislation unfairly discriminates against Adelaide airport by leaving it until the second tranche. We believe that it is only fair that it be included in that first list, and the amendment has been proposed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also propose, as we did with the previous bill, an amendment to prevent the government restoring Kingsford Smith airport to the list under the Airports (Transitional) Bill and the Airports Bill, including it in the first tranche of sales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued that it cannot reopen the east-west runway because it believes that it is unsafe. That has been shown to be clearly fallacious. It is not unsafe.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on the previous bill, I used diagrams which showed pre-November 1994, when the minister made his decision which resulted in the inflicting of unfair noise and which has resulted in the depreciation of land values under these new flight paths and in health problems for people who are being subjected to this unfair battery of noise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be acceding to these amendments for very good reason. Firstly, in respect of Adelaide airport I say: Adelaide airport needs to be extended and it needs to be extended prior to being leased. That is the priority of the South Australian government and it is the priority of our government. The proceeds for that extension, an extension due to commence in March of next year, come from the leasing of Sydney airport. That is where the funds are coming from. Of course, the opposition are proposing that the whole of the leasing process be wrecked by Sydney's being eliminated from the leasing process.</PARA></TALK.START>

They are the only people who can wreck the very carefully negotiated plans between our government and the government in South Australia to see the South Australian airport extended, and extended now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, privatising it in the first tranche is the last thing anyone has recommended. Every bit of financial advice has said: lease the major assets first but extend Adelaide first, before it is leased. Only the opposition would in effect discriminate against Adelaide airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this furphy that has been repeated by the opposition today about reopening the east-west runway, the opposition have always known that inherent in their plan to develop Kingsford Smith airport with parallel runways was the elimination of traffic on the east-west runway. They have known it for as long as this proposal has been around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of them knew it even before they were here in this chamber. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) knew it in 1975. In the New South Wales parliament, when across the chamber from me, he said that the proposal he was speaking in favour of then&mdash;that is, the parallel runway&mdash;would cater for an expansion of the traffic. An acceptance of the solution would mean that cross runways would not have to be used. You knew it in 1975. You have known it at every point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard knew it in 1989 when he was castigating this government for not proceeding with the expansion of Kingsford Smith. The whole of the opposition knew it when they were attacking the then minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, the member for Barton (Mr Punch), at the time he was saying Badgerys Creek should be built. John Howard knew it as Leader of the Opposition, knew it the day he turned up on the Mike Carlton program and knew it in every one of his public utterances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does the opposition no good at all to be claiming that Mr Bill Pollard, the new head of Airservices Australia, has said anything that supports their contention. In point of fact, Mr Pollard has said the opposite. What he said is, `Sure, you can run intersecting operations and they are run around the world.' But he also said, `You cannot run them at the capacity Sydney airport needs to run at to operate effectively, efficiently and to service the demand that is upon it.' And it is a very considerable demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing the opposition have never been able to establish is how you could reopen the east-west runway, as they say they will, for full jet operations using intersecting runways and maintain the capacity. Airservices Australia says that that destroys the capacity. It could be as low as 55, as opposed to the 85 it is designed for and the government is committed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That wrecks the value of the airport, wrecks its ability to service the needs of Sydney. All of this is inherent in the proposal that is being put forward so ineptly by the shadow minister sitting opposite. It is a proposal that would destroy the value of the airports, that would destroy the ability of Badgerys Creek to be built, completed in time for the year 2000 Olympics, that would destroy our ability to proceed with the extension of Adelaide airport with the development of the new runway and would give us arrangements at Sydney airport, not only wrecking its value but destroying its capacity in rendering it less safe. This is, I repeat, the dumbest thing I have ever seen in 25 years of politics. </PARA>

The member for Chifley (Mr Price) complimented the minister by saying that, regardless of how shocking everybody says the minister is and what people say about the minister, he could not condemn the minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minister's comments he said some things about the federal government having done so much for South Australia. He commented on the road changes in Mount Barker, which is in my electorate, and he also commented on the runway extension. Still, even though the government has done so much for South Australia, why is South Australia a second-class citizen when it comes to the sale of the Adelaide airport, the premier airport in South Australia? Why is it that the Adelaide airport cannot be in the first tranche with the other airports being sold around the country? The reason is that South Australians are second-class citizens as far as this government is concerned and have always been treated that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister likes to hand out ugly threats about the coalition's position on this bill. He likes to say that the extension of the runway will be finished first before the sale of the airport, before the lease of the airport. If the extension is not done first, if we do not behave, if the coalition does not do what he wants us to do, then the suggestion hangs in the air that the runway extension might not go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister might like to know&mdash;he probably does know but refuses to tell the House&mdash;is that the extension has already begun in its preliminary stages in South Australia. The money allocated for that extension is a separate allocation. It has nothing to do with the successful leasing of Kingsford Smith airport. To try to link the two is a disgraceful political act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also suggests that the South Australian government in some way supports the Labor Party's position on the sale of the Adelaide airport. Nothing could be further from the truth. On Tuesday of last week the shadow cabinet in Adelaide announced that they would bring forward the sale of Adelaide airport by two years and put it in the first tranche of sales. This was welcomed by the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, who supports the coalition's position and who told me personally that I should do my best to push for that in Canberra for South Australia and for the Adelaide airport. So the government cannot try to clothe itself in the popularity of the South Australian Liberal government on this issue of the Adelaide airport. </PARA>

I think the honourable member for Sturt in his contribution has misrepresented my remarks. Firstly, I had mentioned the contribution of the minister in relation to roads, and also to his shifting of hospital beds to the west. I also point out that my constituents are grateful to this minister for being the first minister, I believe, to take up seriously the issue of the construction of a major airport at Badgerys Creek&mdash;something that I have been seeking for a long time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear to me and my constituents that this construction is contingent upon the sales that are proposed. We accept that.

I also support the proposition of the minister that, if the western suburbs of Sydney are to take full advantage of this airport, it is really important that it be operational, as the minister wishes it to be and as the minister has planned it to be, before the Sydney Olympics. It would be absolutely absurd to have the opening of Badgerys Creek occur after the Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the western suburbs of Sydney&mdash;maybe the honourable member for Sturt wants to take issue with me&mdash;we have supported and seen the value of this airport as a catalyst for jobs. What the opposition is doing&mdash;in my view and, I think you will find, in the view of many people in the electorates of western Sydney&mdash;is to put in jeopardy the big plus that this airport represents for us; that is, having the surety that it will open well before the Olympic Games. It will not be taking the major part of that tourist traffic, but it will be up and running and operational and it will be getting the benefit of the enormous contribution that the Olympic Games will make in my state of New South Wales. Of course, it will have benefits for the whole of Australia. I have some time for the honourable member for Sturt, but I am concerned when he misrepresents the remarks I make. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk in this contribution about how important Adelaide airport is to South Australia, why it is that we want to bring forward the sale of the airport by two years and why the coalition announced that last Tuesday. Adelaide airport is vital to South Australia not because the length of the runway precludes its maximum use in bringing tourists to South Australia but, primarily, because the length of the runway precludes trade opportunities, exports to South-East Asia and imports from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South-East Asia is a market for fresh food produce, which is produced in abundance in South Australia. One of the great problems in trying to get that produce to places like Singapore and Hong Kong is that the size of the planes that take off from Adelaide airport is not sufficient to make it worth while for corporations in that region to use Adelaide airport. Therefore, a market that is waiting for South Australian companies to fill with fresh food produce, amongst many other goods and services, is not being used because of the runway extension not having gone ahead under the state Labor government, although it was promised many times. So the airport is very important to South Australia and the extension of the runway is very important. </PARA>

First of all, we have this wonderful statement that he did all these negotiations for this fabulous deal for South Australia with the Leader of the Opposition, whose name eludes me. And where did he conduct all these marvellous negotiations? At an ALP conference. Isn't that just typical of the way this government does business? You don't talk to the legitimately elected members of the parliament who form government, you don't talk to the Premier of the day; you go off into some little smoke filled backroom and have a little chat to your Labor Party mate. That is the way it has always operated in the New South Wales Right, and well we know it.

This process of sale of airports is not, even under your plans, meant to begin until 1 July 1996. We have at the moment no regulations, no details, no nothing, of what it is you will be selling, just a broad skeletal outline. And you have the audacity to come in here and tell the people of Adelaide that you will stop funding and stop building their extensions because you are going to sell Kingsford Smith airport in 1996 and that will provide the money to pay for it. Does that mean contractors are not going to be paid in the interim? Does that mean they have got to wait? Where is the explanation for those people? You really do make it up, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all justified on the basis that you did a nasty little deal in a backroom with one of your mates, somebody who is not in government, rejected by the people of South Australia&mdash;and for good and proper reasons&mdash;who were bankrupted by the Labor Party, just as Victoria was bankrupted by the Labor Party. You left generation after generation imbued with debt. And this is the same Labor Party. It does not matter whether it is the South Australian Labor Party, the federal Labor Party or the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. Each and every one of you operates with the same lack of morality&mdash;no ethics. You bypass, as I said, the properly elected people of the day and do a little deal to hypothecate the payment of the bills for the extension of the runway out of the proceeds of a sale that is not even meant, under your plan, to take place for years to come. </PARA>

We are sick to death of other sly little meetings that take place in other people's houses, trying to influence the outcome of things of which we never know the consequences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The FAC said that commercially they did believe it was within their priorities until very well into the next century. That was the FAC's position. The member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) said it in this debate. It was about the only factual thing that he said. Mike Rann went to that conference and he secured a very good outcome that was all about South Australia. Let me tell you this: there was nothing grubby about it. It was a very honourable process with a very honourable outcome. I know it; Mike Rann knows it; everyone who was at that conference knows it; everyone in South Australia knows it; and Mike Rann's political opponent, the Premier of South Australia, particularly knows it. This is what he had to say about the outcome. A media release on Premier Brown's own letterhead said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premier Dean Brown today welcomed the agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments for the funding of the Adelaide Airport runway extension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This agreement represents the start of a new era for Adelaide Airport," Mr Brown said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The extension of the runway will open up South Australia to significant new international tourism opportunities and increase airfreight of perishable goods, particularly seafood, into international markets, especially in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The State Government made improvements to the Adelaide Airport and lengthening of the runway a key priority when it took office 18 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Now, after intense negotiations with the Federal Government we have secured agreement on major elements of the upgrading work.</PARA>
<PARA>He was elated; he was delighted. Everyone can take great credit for this, including Mike Rann. Dean Brown was delighted and John Olsen thought it was terrific. Everyone was extraordinarily happy. But then what happened? We reach this chamber on the eve of the forthcoming election and, for the sake of a few lousy votes in John Howard's own electorate of Bennelong, the whole process is derailed. Sydney airport is excluded from the sale by an abuse of the opposition numbers in the Senate. The proceeds are not there to go on with this work. Sure, it will be extended, because we are people of our word. But there is no doubt that, because the sale will be delayed and, if they go ahead with their threat, this legislation will have to be reintroduced in the next parliament some time after the next budget, there will be a delay of at least a year in these processes. That delay will be purely and simply the work of those sitting opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspirations of Dean Brown, the aspirations of Mike Rann, the aspirations of the people of Adelaide and the aspirations that go right across the political course will all be dashed as a result of this act of absolute and utter stupidity by the shadow minister and John Howard. But for what? For the sake of a handful of lousy votes to try to convince people in Sydney that John Howard does not mean what he said over 20 years of active political pursuit; that is, that Kingsford Smith should be expanded and that a parallel runway should be built in the certain knowledge that its construction would involve the north-south axis. He said that again and again. He knew what he was saying. Everyone opposite and everyone in Sydney knows that this was always the position of the opposition, as it was the position of the New South Wales Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their own submission to the EIS said that traffic on the east-west would be eliminated, that people would be worse off with the north-south but that it was all right because more people would be better off rather than worse off.

You are saying that Punch is a dill for resigning because he should have known there was going to be a change in the configuration. That is what you are saying. It is illogical, Minister. Nobody knew that. The three runways were going to be used in conjunction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has always been the position of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Fraser government and successive members of the Liberal Party. We were quite clear as to how Sydney airport was to be used. You interfered politically. You interfered in November 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laurie Oakes, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, had it exactly right when he described what happened. It is no use you denying that. This is exactly what occurred: the Prime Minister and cabinet came in and said that we were going to do it this way, we were going to close the east-west. The Prime Minister has a record of closing runways. He closed one at Bankstown because it aligned with his house when he lived there. That is the fact of the matter: he closed a runway at Bankstown. He has a record of closing runways if they do not suit his personal convenience. That is the way in which this whole thing has operated: it is a matter of personal convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the minister's description of the deals done in Adelaide, it is not a process of inclusive politics. It is a process of doing deals. Minister, you described it that way. You do not stand for the whole community. You represent the Labor Party here. You do not represent your fellow Australians. Nothing could be clearer in the way in which you are now trying to blackmail the Australian community into agreeing with you because it is a Labor Party policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the precision of these amendments and what the bill proposes. Your proposition, Minister, is that if we prevent the leasing of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) all of your works programs will stop. The budget does not say that. The budget is not predicated on any sales. I have here your transport budget, which you signed off. Here it is&mdash;your budget for 1995-96 for the transport portfolio. It is all your stuff. It has pretty pictures in it. There is not a thing in it about the sale of airports being essential for you to complete your program. You do not say that in your budget. Is your budget wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me have a look at the works proposed at Badgerys Creek which you say cannot proceed unless you get this legislation. The EIS was supposed to have started in July. It has not yet started, so there has been no loss of money. Even though much of the work has not started, the works program for Badgerys Creek until the end of this year, 1995, was supposed to have been community consultation, negotiation and funding of lease, environmental assessment, design and documentation, infrastructure design, flight path and airspace management, EIS on Elizabeth Drive, west Sydney orbital stage 1 EIS, the west Sydney orbital stage 2 EIS and the negotiation of contractual arrangements&mdash;none of this requiring a single dollar. It is all paper and telephones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the end of this year you do not need a cent for Sydney airport; you do not need a cent for Badgerys Creek. You do not need a cent until well into next year. But you are now saying that not selling Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is going to stop the construction of Badgerys Creek and cause havoc in South Australia. Nobody will believe that. We just need to get that lorry of lies running around the suburbs telling the people what the real truth is, because you are certainly not telling them the real truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's decision that you need to open the east-west runway is a logical and carefully thought through decision. It is not going to create disruption to anybody or anything. The fact of the matter is that you could give our proposition the tick here in the House, it could go through the Senate and it would be all done. Overnight you would achieve your results.

It is extraordinary that Mike Rann would now be trying to involve himself in the credit for the airport extension at Adelaide airport. He was in government for 12 years, he was the minister for tourism, and he is now trying to come along and pretend that for some reason the government is going to say, `This is a bipartisan issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to delay the House on dealing with these amendments either, but I do think, as the bulk of these amendments relate to two issues&mdash;firstly, tax related issues, which presumably is the government acceding to representations made to them by potential bidders and, secondly, restructuring or new requirements for the FAC board&mdash;I think the minister does owe the House an explanation as to the reason for these amendments in a fairly concise way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it has been requested, I will be more than happy to do that. The two tax related amendments are being introduced to clause 45 to ensure that holders of leases over the airports will be treated in the same way for taxation purposes as if they had been granted leases by a non-tax exempt body&mdash;that is, the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;and that lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged by becoming lessees of an airport company. Clauses 74 and 76 are being amended to clarify requirements under the Archives Act 1983, and schedule 4 is being amended to provide future flexibility on the number of members who may be appointed to the FAC board. I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for reading us those few things, but there are a couple of questions I would like him to answer. In relation to those provisions dealing with the definition of an asset, I wonder if the minister could clarify for the House the implications of that section and that amendment on concessionary leases which are presently held. Secondly, could he tell us why we need the additional flexibility for the board of the continuing FAC? I note from the amendments that it is proposed to enlarge the size of the FAC board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advice to the House is that the amendment in respect of leases will have no effect whatsoever on sublessees. In respect of the second matter raised by the honourable member&mdash;that is, the question of FAC board membership&mdash;that merely allows for a variation of the numbers on the board in the future. In other words, the board does not have to comprise its full complement as the FAC proceeds down the track of its role being diminished through the disposal of the airports to the various lessees in tranche one and tranche two.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of points right through the whole process of both bills where ministerial responsibility is the ultimate factor. I am seeking clarification from the minister. In regard to the commercial operations of airports, will you be requiring reports where you will set the commercial thrust of what is occurring in the airport? I am seeking to clarify the minister's role. What is he expecting to do in regard to the management of each airport? Are you going to have a hands-on approach or will you expect them to operate commercially and refer only certain matters to you?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a very important bill. I am pleased that I am able to complete my speech, which was interrupted by the adjournment debate two nights ago. Clearly there is already a lack of responsiveness in the system and the `clever country' rationale for expansion is not being realised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to comment on the government's failure to foster an economy which is able to absorb the young people being educated in our universities. When the Dawkins revolution was sold to the Australian public in 1988, a major argument for the changes was that Australia's young needed to be educated to fill the highly skilled positions that were to be generated under a Labor government. Parents and young people accepted this story and invested money, energy and hope in the acquisition of a university education. Too many have found that the government's sales pitch was a gross distortion of reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While graduate unemployment is lower than unemployment for young people without degrees, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that graduates have simply shifted into positions formerly held by non-graduates, rather than into the highly skilled positions promised them by the Labor government. Not only is this a tragedy for the non-graduates who are pushed into unemployment by the influx of graduates into positions previously held by non-graduates; it is also a tragedy for the young graduates who worked so hard towards a dream which they are now finding to be empty. </PARA>

The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is the sort of bill that goes to the heart of the social justice debate in which the parliament has been engaging in recent months. On that, in my experience, working people in Australia are concerned not so much with ownership issues as with skills and opportunities, and the active role of government in enhancing the economic and social capability of those genuinely in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's education system is at the heart of this task. I had two reminders of this recently, both of them relevant to the higher education sector. The first of them was the comments made by Rupert Murdoch, expressing concern about the development of an underclass and the high level of youth unemployment in some parts of Australia. I thought people on the coalition side had a hide in making some of their comments on social justice issues, but for someone who sponsored the Thatcherite revolution in Britain and actively supported Reaganomics in the United States to be complaining about the development of an underclass is, indeed, exceptionally rich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reminder on these issues arose on Monday. I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that the average TER&mdash;the equivalent these days of what had been known as the HSC&mdash;mark was twice as high in the north shore and eastern suburbs of Sydney than in western Sydney and south-western Sydney. The interesting thing about those figures&mdash;of course, they are in relation to school education&mdash;is that once people from western and south-western Sydney gain entry to university they do as well as people from any other part of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reinforces the importance of the link between higher education and school education and, in both sectors, the importance of the home learning environment. It is very important to broaden our concept of education beyond formal institutions, be they school education or higher education, to include the home learning environment where issues of advantage and disadvantage are so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I outline four principles that I believe are significant in the parliament's consideration of higher education in Australia. The first of those principles, of course, is the need for quality outcomes. What we have found, with the internationalisation of the Australian economy, is that all factors of production have now become mobile, except human skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, the quality of human skills determines a nation's wealth. The new growth theorists, who are becoming very popular in economic debates and forums, have emphasised the importance of a culture of innovation in a country in order to have successful trading and economic arrangements. A culture of entrepreneurship is very important for a nation's economic success. Higher education in Australia should be at the absolute vanguard of the shift in culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I think, on the issue of social values and leadership our universities need to play a more prominent role in the public debate. I was recently part of the parliament's delegation to the European parliament. As part of that, we listened to Chancellor Kohl, the German Chancellor, at the Council of Europe. He explained how all Western societies have an opportunity, in the 1990s and beyond, to define our societies by combining `the humanism of antiquity with the rationalism of our times'. That is a beautiful phrase and a beautiful set of ideals and values that are all about excellence, quality, compassion and a more enlightened society. Our universities should be at the absolute vanguard of defining such values and actively promoting their worth throughout all parts of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle I would define for the higher education sector is in terms of responsiveness to economic change and responsiveness to the internationalisation of the Australian economy. I have used this example in the parliament previously but I think it is worth repeating. Alcatel is a telecommunications company just to the north of my electorate. Its training cycle, its education cycle, is of just six months duration. Because of rapid technological change in that industry the company cannot sensibly plan ahead for the training needs of its staff for any more than six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This emphasises the problem for those in school or higher education who want to focus excessively on fixed content. I notice that Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, is trying to focus on content. Content, of course, is always changing as technology and our economy change in response to international pressures. In many respects, with regard to fixed content in the curriculum of schools or universities, once people leave those institutions they remember very little of the content they picked up at school or university. The way of learning is all important and that is really where our universities should be placing more emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are our universities in Australia responsive to these influences? Are they responsive to the sorts of economic and social changes that Australia has gone through over the last 10 to 15 years? I have some reservations about institutions that are based on guaranteed income, institutions that are based on tenure&mdash;that is, guaranteed employment for staff no matter the quality of their outcomes. I have reservations about outdated management methods in the university sector in Australia. Our universities, essentially, are based on 19th century small `l' liberal values embracing diversity at any cost, a belief in learning for the sake of learning and a feudal protection of tenure and academic freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my very strong belief that our nation, with the challenges it faces over coming decades, needs much more than learning for learning's sake. We need learning and skills that are relevant to our economic position and our social requirements. This is where universities have such an important role to play. They must be relevant to the economy and, of course, provide social leadership in terms of promoting more enlightened social values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle I will address is this issue of a lifetime commitment to education. I think it is a peculiar thing in Australia&mdash;indeed, it is an unusual thing&mdash;when we look at some of our trading competitors. In Australia, education is seen as something that people undertake until their early 20s and it is somewhat of a task. What we need in Australia is an ethos of continuous, lifelong education throughout all parts of the population. There must be continuous updating of the skills and knowledge required for people to be successful in internationalised economic arrangements, successful in a post-industrial society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of continuous education, a lifetime commitment, and the promotion of a government framework for lifetime education basically requires a revolution in our thinking about education, including the higher education sector and the systems of service delivery that we have inherited over the decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth question I will raise&mdash;and I mentioned this earlier on&mdash;is equity, the problem of intergenerational disadvantage in our post-industrial society. We really do need to tackle the fact that, while our schools can have a disadvantaged schools program and while we can have equity funding for universities, we need to link those initiatives to the home learning environment. That is the root cause of educational disadvantage in Australia in the 1990s. New forms of information technology are the great opportunity for linking the home and the formal learning environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these methods may be intensive in their case management. Some of these methods may be expensive in their case management and their administration for government, but it is an expense that is well worth meeting if we are to meet the challenge of a more inclusive society. If we are to find the sorts of remedies that Rupert Murdoch would press upon us in his pious complaints then we should realise that ever smaller government is not the answer. Some of these remedies have a fiscal cost. Those who want to argue the case for social justice and a more inclusive society should be willing to meet the cost. It is important to recognise those realities. Smaller government is not an answer when it comes to building a more inclusive, a more socially just Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest also that universities should be more active in addressing these issues of educational inequity and educational disadvantage. I was quite inspired to read a comment from a speech by the late Mr Peter Wilenski, one of the great educational administrators and reformers in Australia's history. He made the speech in my part of Sydney at the University of Western Sydney, in its formative days, on 10 October 1987. I think it is a very good statement to provide to the parliament. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issues of equity of access should not be afterthoughts forced on a university by reformist governments. They go to the heart of what a university is about. The socioeconomic maldistribution in our university student population, the fact that children of poor parents are many more times unlikely to go to university than children of equal ability from wealthy families, represents not only a major social injustice and enormous waste of talent for society, but also a deviation from the pursuit of excellence by universities who as a result have less than the best students. It is little wonder that the half of the community which is less advantaged has not come to the defence of the universities when the universities appear to have so little relevance to their lives or those of their children. Of course, the fault lies to a large extent with the pre-university education system but universities can have a major role in influencing that system.</PARA>
<PARA>There are big challenges for higher education in Australia in meeting each of these four principles. I was delighted to learn that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has appointed a higher education management review team which is due to report in December. I also noticed with some degree of interest that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and some of the other authorities in higher education were very concerned about the fact that there would be an external review of their relevance to our economic arrangements and to the training and skill requirements in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a good sign that the universities are apprehensive about the external review. They should not be immune from the review process&mdash;the sort of reform, the sort of initiative that has affected all sections of our society, the school education system, TAFE, and all forms of learning. Universities should not be sheltered away, hiding behind walls of academic tenure and attempts to secure academic freedom at any cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House is interesting and very important because it addresses some of these key issues of equity in the distribution of resources between states and the distribution of resources by the federal government between universities. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) makes amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to adjust funding levels as a result of the allocation of new places, additional research funds, carry forward of quality funds and the inclusion of funding for 1997 and 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding will be provided to close to 6,000 new higher education places, plus those in the pipeline, in the years 1996 to 1998 to states with strong population growth and currently low participation rates. Queensland will be a major beneficiary of these places, as will New South Wales and Western Australia. They will also be receiving additional places. I am delighted&mdash;I note that my colleague the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is at the table&mdash;that the University of Western Sydney has been a major beneficiary of the additional growth allocation in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the minister, Mr Simon Crean, on his initiative. He is a minister who is prepared to take on the difficult public policy task of redistributing much needed university resources to areas of rapid population growth like the west and south-west of Sydney to areas like our region which has low participation rates for tertiary education. Good on Simon Crean for doing these things. I look forward to the formalisation of this type of funding formula, to build into the institutions this sense of redistribution. We have a changing economy, changing growth in population and changing social needs. A region such as greater western Sydney should never be overlooked as part of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package provides the consideration given to faster growing regions with low rates of tertiary participation. The challenge now is to institutionalise these transfers in the higher education funding formulas. The model adopted in 1990 by the government served as an aggregate historical cost system adjusted through teaching and research related cost components. Added to this base level is approved funding for growth. Once growth has been allocated it becomes part of the base for the following year of the rolling triennium: that is, each university's funding generally equals last year's base, adjusted for changes in the teaching profile and research requirement, plus a growth component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these arrangements, the arrangements that the minister has now altered, it was very difficult to move resources between institutions. The tendency was to entrench the funding position of larger, older universities and aggravate the financial challenge facing newer universities in regions of rapid population growth. Only the redistribution of public resources can ensure that the rate of population growth in outer metropolitan areas such as my seat in the south-west of Sydney is matched by the growth in government services. Politically this is never a simple task. Entrenched interest will fight hard, even academics will fight hard, to preserve existing facilities and benefits compared to regions which have gone without and are struggling to secure new services. Nowhere are vested interests more entrenched than in Australia's universities. The mystique of research and administrative autonomy has produced a feeling that somehow universities should be treated differently from other areas of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time is long overdue to bring higher education into the mainstream of political principles, and a number of reforms stand out. The first of those is to institutionalise, to build into funding formulas, the redistribution of funds to universities on the basis of high population growth and low tertiary participation&mdash;it is a basic equity principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative is to make sure that population growth in outer metropolitan areas is accommodated by growth in outer metropolitan universities, not inner city institutions. I noted that the joint DEET-Higher Education Council working party at the end of last year expressed a remarkable view. This is what the discussion paper had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not considered that all, or even most, of the resources made available to a State should automatically be allocated to regional institutions in areas of high population growth or low participation in higher education. In the major capital cities in particular, a number of universities will be in commuting distance for most students. There is no reason to exclude institutions in inner city areas, for example, from access to additional resources simply because of their location . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What the discussion paper is effectively saying is that location is not relevant. Try telling that to a university aspirant living in my electorate in Campbelltown, where in driving time people are closer to Goulburn than they are to Sydney University or the University of New South Wales. Try telling that to the thousands of students in that region of the 1970s and 1980s&mdash;I was one of them&mdash;who did not have a university in their part of Sydney and had to commute for 1 1/2 hours one way, three hours each day, to Camperdown for Sydney University or to Kensington for the University of New South Wales. The travelling time and the expense were a great disadvantage, a great hardship to the students of Sydney's west and south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my very strong belief, as it is within the government, that resources for regions of fast population growth need to be allocated to the universities which directly service those regions. I reject this spurious argument that somehow inner city institutions can equitably and fairly service the needs of university students on the urban fringe. The DEET-HEC approach would impose large costs in travel time and expenses on students from outer metropolitan areas. It does not sit well with policies to provide equality of higher education opportunity. The 1994 ALP national conference resolved to develop a series of social justice benchmarks on access and equity issues. Higher education funding should set basic standards for the availability of university places and reducing the time and expenses faced by student commuters, particularly those at the urban fringe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third initiative would be to develop funding formulas on the basis of regional rather than state needs. The DEET-HEC discussion paper used state boundaries as its unit of locational analysis. This contradicts the government's general support for regionalism and funding arrangements that support regional equity. Real geographic distinctions in Australia are regional, not between the states. State boundaries&mdash;lines drawn in at Whitehall last century&mdash;have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality. For instance, while the New South Wales population is projected to fall, some parts of the state, such as the north coast and also the south-west of Sydney, face some of the highest rates of population growth in all of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fourth initiative&mdash;and I trust the minister is keen on this idea&mdash;is to build socioeconomic indicators and notions of regionality into the higher education funding formulas. The Kelty report on regional development in 1993 recommended the government should take into account the regional services provided by higher education institutions when assessing their eligibility for funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of skilled labour is now arguably the single most important determinant of regional competitiveness. Educational agendas can be tuned to regional agendas while also addressing international competitiveness, thus becoming important instruments for economic development. Funding allocations to support these objectives can be tied to specific projects or linked to broader notions of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage at a regional level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of these indicators for higher education funding would present few difficulties. The ABS has done significant work on the measurement of socioeconomic conditions by geographic areas. The major challenge in applying these indices lies in the relationship of a higher education institution to its student catchment area. There would be little purpose in providing growth funds to an institution to increase regional participation if the bulk of students came from outside the region. It would first be necessary to establish the proportion of students of each institution which is drawn from the regional catchment. Big challenges, a good bill and good work on the part of the minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to listen to the argument from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I thought some of his initiatives were commendable and some of his argument was quite good. But I was interested to listen to his contribution to the debate because he started talking about the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 about 12 minutes into his speech. He spoke basically about the varying levels of grants funding for certain higher education institutions that are part of this particular amendment. He did not speak much about the HECS debt contribution scheme. He did not speak much at all on the voluntary threshold for repayment of the HECS debt, setting new income thresholds at which people become liable to repay their HECS debts, introducing a mandatory up-front payment for HECS for certain New Zealanders and non-citizens, and removing the HECS exemption scholarships for the professional development of teachers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to address some of those issues today, because it is an abomination&mdash;the Labor government's great HECS hoax. Far too often, for far too long, we have heard a tirade of Labor government rhetoric, reaction and, in some ways, rhubarb. All too often, we have heard the slick promises couched in terms of equity, fairness and across-the-board change when the reality is that the Labor government is set on one course and one course alone. That is the money course: the yellow brick road to revenue collection. The government has a bag full of revenue raising tricks, all underhanded, all covert and all designed to rob&mdash;yes, rob&mdash;ordinary Australians of a few dollars here and a few dollars there, in the same fashion as that of a sneakthief or a crafty cat burglar who comes stealing in the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's HECS debate is but one example of the way the government operates. It is yet another example of appearing to do the right thing but, in reality, stifling the opportunity of some Australian&mdash;some Mr or Mrs Average. In this case, it is the student who is the target. Fortunately, I am not aligned to the government's way of thinking, and I suspect their current practices are less than honest. I speak in facts, not rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give a few examples of the government's hidden attack on the people of Australia and some of its covert activities. Since 1993, Australians have had to absorb a hidden hike in sales tax, a hidden hike that has seen the working Australian&mdash;the good, old-fashioned, true-blue Aussie battler&mdash;having to absorb and actually pay for increases in sales taxes of the magnitude of 46 per cent on passenger vehicles, a whopping 30 per cent on wines and cider and 10 per cent on essential items such as toothpaste and soap.

Yes, this coconut and jam mainstay of Australia in the 1960s is now almost a luxury item for many families in Australia. Why is this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will move on. But all are examples of hidden or covert collection of money, and that is what this great HECS hoax is all about. I call it a hoax in that it all seems okay on the surface, but in fact there are a few issues quietly slipped into this bill that are not all that they seem. They are actually yet another way for the government to squeeze more money from the already stretched budgets of students and possibly of their families who sponsor or support their studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has taken a shine to all things foreign&mdash;foreign debt, foreign students, foreign clocks, and foreign suits in some cases. So the government clan has decided that there is real loot to be made by having these `foreigners' studying in the Australian education system. The government has decided, in its so-called wisdom, that it will have a mandatory up-front payment for all education fees paid by non-citizens&mdash;notice that I was careful to avoid that word `foreign'&mdash;or permanent Australian residents who do not take out Australian citizenship. This has been designed to stop people from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving the country without paying their HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here is the hoax: how does this relate, translate to or help our longstanding permanent residents who, for various reasons&mdash;and often very personal reasons&mdash;have not taken out Australian citizenship? Those students, regardless of their citizenship status, who have already commenced their studies must be protected. These people must be protected and a degree of balance and equity must prevail under these circumstances. On a different level, the changes in this regard may have far-reaching results that few would anticipate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it, education worldwide is a growing business. Educational institutions are chosen by reputation. However, this is usually balanced with the amount those potential students can afford. Students, particularly those from overseas or the children of resident Australians, want a quality education. But they also need to know what it will cost and when. Reality dictates that very few people&mdash;I stress very few&mdash;can afford an up-front payment. And the member for Werriwa was talking about equity and access! In fact, few would pay for a service they had not yet tested, and even fewer would actually pay for a service they had not yet received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to compete in the field of education on an international scale&mdash;and I believe that as a nation we should and we can&mdash;our fee structure must be flexible and structured to entice and encourage students, and it must not develop into a system which poses a threat to potential users. However, as you probably realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am a bit of a pragmatist, and if this payment is to be put in place, regardless of the potential for resistance by overseas students, it must not be used to the detriment of existing students. It must be introduced only at a time that all potential students are fully aware of this up-front payment and the up-front payment requirement should not apply to existing students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has another slight hoax in the making. In most bills presented by the Labor government, there seems to be some point that relates to money collection. This one is no exception. It may be couched in different terms, but the reality always seems to shine through. The government has actively encouraged students to move into tertiary education. It has done this, firstly, through their inability to provide jobs and openings in the employment sector for young people and, secondly, by encouraging most employers to consider only those people with training or academic qualifications as worthwhile employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has forced many young people to continue in long-term education programs and older adults to return to study as the only option for career development and advancement. So our tertiary institutions are full and we have increased retention rates. I think I recently heard the Vice-Chancellor of ANU saying that there were now more people studying in university than ever before but fewer people actually going to university. The question then is how is that the case when there are more people staying on at university to do their double degrees and not allowing people to enter university?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an ideal environment for the government to collect a little more revenue and put a few more dollars in their greedy little moneybags. And the result? With this bill, students will be slugged for the second time in three years, through the government seeking to accelerate the rate of repayments of HECS. This may be all very well as a revenue collection ploy. However, by changing the rules midway, our current students are denied any option to plan for their future, and are faced with constant uncertainty as to exactly what they have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can they be expected to plan ahead? We are always thinking about the future, yet we are not allowing our students&mdash;who are the future of our great nation&mdash;to plan ahead. How can students be expected to have any sort of financial management, especially when so many students are supported by families, or survive on part-time employment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is imperative that current students and graduates are protected from the government's latest HECS grab for dollars. On a more sobering note, there is an overall tragedy in this whole scenario. The tragedy is that at a philosophical level the bill is sound, and most of the proposed changes, in essence, are not under debate. I am speaking of the HECS hoax that has been revealed in this debate&mdash;that is the tragedy. What is highly questionable is the suite of tactics which is constantly and conveniently used by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would have the people of Australia believe that it is doing a great job, but as with the HECS hoax, when you look closely into the issues, time and time again the government is revealed as caring little for natural justice, fairness or balance in its thinking and policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, there are two key areas of concern in relation to this bill. Firstly, for the purposes of fairness, equity and honesty in government, the repayment thresholds should and must apply only to students who commence their studies from 1996. Secondly, also for the sake of fairness, equity and honesty in government, the up-front payments for students who have not taken out Australian citizenship should apply only to people who commence studies after 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should forget about the grab for dollars and address the issues&mdash;issues such as our debt and our increasing tax burden.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two sections of this legislation are of particular concern to me: part 5, which provides for the new repayment thresholds for HECS, and part 9, which requires that permanent residents who have not met the requirements for citizenship, one year or more before enrolment, pay up-front fees. Part 9, establishing a discount for people who commence HECS repayments before reaching the compulsory threshold, also deserves more than a cursory glance. Part 5 of the bill provides three new repayment thresholds for HECS. These new thresholds are inserted within the existing levels. This measure, in effect, entails an accelerated rate of repayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that this is the third time the government has attempted to introduce an accelerated repayment rate since the HEC scheme began operation. Two years ago, I raised the same issues of certainty, the one-sided nature of the HECS contract and the fact that in this contract the government was the powerful proponent, able to alter a contract, where the other side had no say in it and could not say, `I'm going to give up studying, because I'm not going to pay this HECS debt any more.' The students are in a totally vulnerable position. Two years ago, the government tried to do the same thing, and I raised the same issues then. At that stage, they promised that it would not happen again, that there would be one change and that would be it, and that they would not move to have such an accelerated repayment again. Yet here we are debating the same issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition proposes to amend the bill so that this whole range of new measures applies only to students who begin studies from next year onwards rather than having it affect those students who have signed HECS agreements under a set of entirely different conditions. This retrospectivity in principle is wrong, but in this case it is utterly unacceptable. As I said before, the student is the vulnerable party in this contract. A student cannot start a law, arts or science degree and, when the government jacks up the HECS to be paid back through the tax system, then say, `Right; it's time for me to move on, I'm not going to complete my degree.' Obviously, the government has complete power over that student while ever the student is studying at university and it can change the student's HECS at will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 9 of the bill seeks to prevent those overseas persons who undertake education in Australian tertiary institutions and then return overseas from leaving unpaid any HECS debts they may incur. DEET figures show that there are currently 26,000 permanent residents studying in Australian universities. It is estimated that around half of these meet the residency requirements that allow them to defer their HECS, and that most of the remainder will take out citizenship by the 1996 academic year, leaving only around 2,200 liable for up-front fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure creates a number of concerns. The amendment, at best, can only partially prevent rorting of the system. The amendment only relates to persons who have met the citizenship requirement of two years residency as permanent residents, making it possible for students from overseas to complete a degree as a permanent resident before becoming eligible for citizenship. What is the point?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill, overseas students from countries which permit dual citizenship&mdash;for example, Hong Kong&mdash;would have little difficulty in taking out Australian citizenship and returning to their country of origin, leaving their HECS debt unpaid. At the same time, the bill creates hardship for students from those countries&mdash;for example, Malaysia&mdash;that do not allow dual citizenship, who may need to retain the citizenship of their original country for a variety of reasons. So we are creating two classes of overseas students in Australia: those who will be able to avoid the government's proposals, and those who will have to make a choice and possibly suffer deleterious effects by so doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has claimed that the amendment will save $1.8 million in this fiscal year and $3.8 million in 1997-98. It appears to be a particularly cumbersome method of saving what are relatively small amounts, and when the potential for rorting that will still exist is considered it may well prove unable to even match this much. The amounts claimed are $3.8 million and $1.8 million. Only yesterday, I heard from a report that was tabled by the Australian National Audit Office that the Department of Social Security could save $86 million by changing some of the systems that it has adopted. Yet the government is happy to punish students and make their lives almost impossible and is happy to have legislation which is still full of loopholes and which students will still be able to get around&mdash;all for a measly $3.8 million and $1.8 million, when they will not make the changes that would save $86 million in the DSS!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than applying this measure to current students, the coalition is again seeking to amend it so that it will only affect students commencing studies in 1996. I should also mention in passing that part 4 of the bill makes provision for a discount to be offered to students and recent students who voluntarily commence the repayment of their HECS debt when their income reaches $20,000 per annum rather than when it reaches the current level, which is $26,853. Persons who are tempted by this discount to attempt to repay HECS while on incomes of this level may well find they lack the economic capacity to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More concerning is that fears have been expressed that this measure may well be the first step towards lowering the compulsory threshold. In other words, it may be the thin end of the wedge. Who can trust this government on HECS, on how they deal with tertiary students, when at almost every opportunity they have had to break a promise to students they have broken it? They have said it will be voluntary if you want to repay your HECS when you are earning less than $26,853. How long will it be before they lower the compulsory threshold, before they say, `So many people are able to do so voluntarily, we will make it compulsory for everyone'? It is a very dangerous situation for students to be in when they are faced with a government that has no regard for the contract signed with students. These three aspects all demonstrate the weaknesses of the existing HECS. As I said earlier, it is inequitable and it denies its participants any real sense of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the NUS on the issue? Why is it that the National Union of Students have absolutely no capacity to defend students against this government? They are hopelessly inadequate. The reason they are hopelessly inadequate is that they are an arm of the ALP government and the government takes them utterly for granted. As they have demonstrated in election after election, they are more than prepared to campaign for and support the Labor Party, even though the Labor Party constantly humiliates them, takes them for granted, uses them up and spits them out. The NUS should be ashamed of themselves. It is high time they started representing students rather than representing their own ambitions for factional advancement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under HECS, students contribute around one-fifth of the average cost of a higher education place. Each semester, students choose either to pay up-front or to defer payment. Students who can pay their fees directly to the institution receive a discounted fee, with the Commonwealth paying the balance on their behalf. Students who defer payment accept a loan from the Commonwealth which pays their liability for the semester to the institution, and they begin repaying these loans when their taxable income reaches a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When students sign up for the payment options form, everything is fine if they can afford to pay up-front. But, if they choose to pay later, they are signing a weighted contract with a party that can change its conditions and does so at whim. Such a situation would not be tolerated in the private sector. It is only government that allows such abuses to take place. However, students have no choice. They can either sign the form or they can forget about their education. I do not believe that I need to spell out to the House who benefits and who loses from such a situation. If you can afford to pay HECS up-front, it is all well and good. But students who cannot afford to pay sign a contract with a party that can increase repayments and can change conditions of the contract at any time. As HECS currently exists, it discriminates against the less well off and the underprivileged. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current HECS arrangements students do not have any clear idea of how much extra will be going out of their pay packets once they have reached the threshold. Too many young people have learnt over recent years that a degree or other tertiary qualification is scarcely a ticket for a job. Yet at a time when budgeting is vital, when they are establishing careers, when they are getting married, saving for a deposit on a home or incurring a mortgage, the government can suddenly&mdash;and does&mdash;increase their repayments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By putting forward amendments to parts 5 and 9 of this bill the coalition is not interfering with the basis of the government's proposed changes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in rising to make a contribution to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995. It is interesting to note that from this side of the House we have had a long list of speakers contributing to this debate. Yet on the other side of the House there is little interest&mdash;one speaker following the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). Quite clearly, the Labor Party has very little interest in students' capacity to meet this higher education contribution tax&mdash;the graduate tax that this government wants to impose on hard-pressed students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all recognise that improving our base of knowledge, our skills and our expertise is necessary if we are going to meet the needs of the 21st century. A sophisticated education system is central to this task. It is our challenge to develop an education system that not only is innovative in a technological and industrial sense but also maximises the potential of our greatest resource of all&mdash;the people and, more particularly, in reference to this bill, the next generation of Australians. To accomplish this, we must encourage the entry of talented and dedicated people to the education system and we must maximise the contribution they make to national life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is because the legislation before us today hampers that contribution by limiting access to education places as well as creating instability in the HECS arrangements that the coalition is opposed to many features of this bill. It is grossly unfair in its application and generates a level of uncertainty which cannot be tolerated. It is particularly unfair to present and future students from rural and remote Australia who are already greatly disadvantaged in terms of their access to educational opportunities. One of the great impediments, apart from financial constraints, that those students face is the tyranny of distance that they confront in gaining access to further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents the third time in the short life of the HECS system that significant alterations have been made to the higher education contribution scheme repayments schedule. These constant amendments and alterations create uncertainty for all Australians participating or wishing to participate in higher education. The decision about whether to enter a university or other institute of higher learning is not an easy one and involves a lot of consideration and planning. In deciding to undertake a course of study a student will often sacrifice immediate comforts and financial rewards in favour of the opportunity of a better and higher paid job in later life. Entering a university also involves planning for such things as accommodation and travel, and often the need to seek and undertake part-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But such forward planning is made extremely difficult by the Labor government, which refuses to guarantee stable and predictable HECS arrangements. No-one can be sure what Labor is going to do with higher education funding from one year to the next. One of the most disgraceful elements of this legislation is that it proposes to change the HECS structure midstream. In other words, it will apply to all those students who are in the middle of their study program. In other words, it is retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is grossly unfair to those students who have organised their lives according to a different HECS arrangement. It is not only unfair to these students but also unfair to the many parents who are deeply involved in the planning of their children's education. This is why the coalition seeks to amend this section of the legislation to ensure that the new threshold levels apply only to students who will commence their studies in 1996. The coalition's position on this amendment is a fair and proper one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students in the middle of their courses have the right to certainty in their HECS repayment schedule and this government is failing to provide that. HECS is like a personal loan from the government, but Labor wants to change the repayment rate in the middle of the borrowing period. Imagine the outcry from society if banks wanted to force this legislation on first home buyers in this country. The same principle applies here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If banks were to attempt to try this sort of approach, they would not get away with it. Yet this is precisely what the Labor Party is proposing to do. If ever proof was needed of the government's lack of commitment to students in higher education, the attempt to impose these threshold changes retrospectively is it. As usual, the government has tried to shift the blame by claiming that extra higher education places will be jeopardised if the opposition blocks the retrospective parts of this bill. What humbug! What scaremongering! In reality, it is the government which has totally mismanaged the higher education system. It has proved that by slugging this increase on existing students so that it can afford to pay for extra tertiary places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not respond to the government's attempt at blackmail. The Minister for Education in that lame duck Labor Party government in Queensland tried to scare the people of Queensland by saying that, if the coalition blocks this legislation, places at universities will be at risk. It is nothing more than blackmail and nothing more than blatant scaremongering, at a time when parents and students are trying to plan the future education needs and requirements of their children. For the coalition to respond to blackmail would be to abandon the students who have been so shabbily treated by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned by Labor's proposed changes in the bill which will impact very heavily on students and families from rural and remote Australia. Many of these young people and their families are already burdened by unique financial and social pressures. Drought has seriously cut the incomes of thousands of rural families. For example, more than half the broadacre livestock enterprises in this country have had a negative income for the last three years. In my own electorate of Maranoa, many broadacre producers have recorded substantial negative incomes for the last four years. When their financial returns for the coming 12 months are recorded, the way the season looks, there will be another year of negative incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this, people in rural areas have average incomes which are significantly lower than the rest of the population. We have only to look at the 1991 census figures. They show that the median family income in my own electorate of Maranoa is about $26,450 per family. If you compare that with the median income of families in the seat of Brisbane, you will see that it has a median family income of $35,909. It illustrates my point that, based on official statistics from 1991, the parents of students from rural and remote areas of Australia, as a result of their backgrounds, have a lower median family income than the families of students from our capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the 1991 census figures, the median family income in the New South Wales seat of Gwydir, the seat of the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson)&mdash;just to assure the House that I am not just talking parochially about my own seat&mdash;is $25,782. The median family income in the electorate of Greenway, a safe Labor seat in western Sydney, however, is $40,365. I could provide example after example demonstrating that students from families of rural and remote Australia are disadvantaged not only because of the tyranny of distance but also because their families have a lower median income than those of people who live in our capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural families will have even less money to live on and to keep their farms and businesses going if the government gets its way and increases the tax on those graduates who have been fortunate enough to get a decent job. This in turn will make it more difficult to pay for the education costs of the next generation. With declining incomes and increased taxes, farming families also have less opportunity to pay up-front fees for higher education and so escape these HECS increases. So families in rural Australia are doubly disadvantaged by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation created by the legislation is typical of Labor's approach to education, and particularly to the education of rural and remote Australians. After 13 years the Labor Party has demonstrated that it has no commitment to providing a fair deal for rural students. In 1993, the year 12 retention rate for students in urban areas was 66 per cent, but for students who live in remote areas the figure was only 52 per cent. A similar story can be told with respect to higher education. In 1989, the number of students enrolled in higher education who came from urban based locations was 78 per cent of the total. This meant that rural and remote students filled only 22 per cent of the total of all higher education places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government made some noise about responding to these poor figures. In 1990 it launched its equity program called `A fair chance for all: higher education that's within everyone's reach'. Remember that? I am sure the House well remembers it. The minister for education at the time, Mr Baldwin, promised, `All Australians with the potential to succeed in higher education should have the opportunity to benefit from higher education qualifications.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the release of this program, and in light of the minister's fine words, many parents in rural Australia believed that their children's educational prospects would be much rosier. But these hopes have been dashed. The overall participation rate of rural and remote students in higher education actually fell in the years following the report. Despite the government's commitment to providing equity in education, only 21 per cent of all higher education students in 1991 came from rural and remote Australia. Yet the total for the non-urban population of Australia was actually above 30 per cent. But the story is even worse for those students living in the really remote areas of this country. In the 1991 census the population of remote Australia was 12 per cent, but the percentage of remote students enrolled in higher education was only two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1994 report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training revealed that this situation has not improved. It is important to note that the most common reasons given for this low participation rate are locational disadvantages and financial restrictions. In other words, it had nothing to do with the demand for these places and it had nothing to do with ability. But remember the minister's words: `All Australians with the potential to succeed . . . should have the opportunity to benefit from higher education . . . ' Well, rural and remote students have done all they can. They have demonstrated that they have the potential to succeed in higher education, but this government has failed to give them the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, it is unlikely that this opportunity will ever be provided by this government. While demand for tertiary places is at an all-time high, Commonwealth student assistance has been substantially reduced. Following the May budget this year, Austudy assistance is also set to decrease by $35 million over four years. This comes at a time when access to higher education is becoming increasingly difficult for lower income groups. In 1980, under a coalition government, 48 per cent of students from the least affluent sector of the population entered higher education. In 1989, under a Labor Party government that had been in office for six years, the percentage had fallen to 35 per cent. Students from rural areas are increasingly falling into this lower income group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government has paid insufficient attention to the falling participation rates of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. One need only look at Labor's farm assets test which now excludes&mdash;and this is a DPIE figure included in a Senate report last year&mdash;about 5,400 students from receiving Austudy support. That is a federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy figure, not my figure. This means there are 5,400 students prevented from receiving a tertiary education. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have only to look at the figures I quoted earlier&mdash;four years of negative farm incomes&mdash;which means that many of those families are unable to provide financial assistance to these students to keep them in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can produce example after example in my electorate of students who have been pulled out of university places because their families could not afford to keep them there. They have lost the opportunity to gain that further education. No amount of bleating from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, the other day, when he tried to tip a bucket on some of the comments I have made publicly on this issue, will convince me that my comments are not accurate; they are. Even his own department shows that 5,400 students are being locked out of receiving Austudy assistance because of the farm assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of all this is that rural students are hamstrung by the restrictive and inequitable education policies of the Labor government. The bill before us today is only going to worsen that disability. Yet quality education is of vital economic and social importance to all Australians, including rural communities. We are all only too aware that many in our rural and remote regions are in a serious state of decline. Depriving the best and the brightest in these regions of adequate education is not the way to reverse this trend. Rural and remote Australia requires innovative ideas and increased opportunities to unlock its great potential. A highly educated and well trained rural population can contribute to this task. But this requires a commitment to providing access for rural and remote Australians to higher education places. Obviously, this government does not have that commitment. These changes to HECS will only represent another obstacle to students and families hoping to obtain a higher education. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Labor politicians and their student union lackeys on campuses throughout Australia continue to peddle the myth that only the ALP can look after the interests of students. However, if you take a quick look back over the last 12 years of federal Labor government, you begin to wonder what students have to be thankful for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine some of these myths. The first myth I wish to dispel is in regard to university fees. When Labor first came to office in 1983, it promoted itself as being the no fees party, and I stress that point. We were told that free tertiary education was part of the Labor manifesto. In 1988 the Labor Party introduced HECS, and it was forced to remodel itself, to reinvent itself, as the no up-front fees party. So it moved from the no fees party to the no up-front fees party. We were told that no up-front fees were part of the Labor manifesto. Then the Keating government removed restrictions on universities charging fees for postgraduate courses&mdash;much to the anger of students right across Australia because they could see what was coming later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly, the Labor Party became the no up-front fees for undergraduates party. So it moved from a no fees party to a no up-front fees party to a no up-front fees for undergraduates party. We were told that no up-front fees for undergraduates were part of the Labor manifesto. In 1995, as contained in the bill before us today, the Labor Party wants to introduce up-front fees for at least one category of undergraduate students: those permanent residents who are not Australian citizens. So the ALP manifesto is now no up-front fees for Australian undergraduates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this trail of broken promises on the fee paying structure issue, how would any students trust this government again? What will be the little variation in the next budget or the budget after that, should the Labor Party be fortunate enough to be re-elected? Having singled out one category of undergraduate students to pay up-front fees, how long will it be before this Labor government finds another group of undergraduates who should be paying up-front fees for their tertiary education? That is the very point I made when universities were allowed to charge for postgraduate courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the second myth. Labor's fee paying hypocrisy is not just limited to up-front fees. If we look in detail at the Labor record on HECS, we find that the government has moved to gain more and more revenue from students. Since the 1993 election, Labor has either introduced or attempted to introduce double HECS for undergraduate degrees; 1 1/2 times HECS for those taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree; a pro rata repayment, a method of substantially lowering the repayment threshold; a lower repayment threshold; a raised rate of repayment across the board; and a changed method of repayment. The coalition has been successful in blocking a number of these proposals, including the doubling of HECS, the 1 1/2 times HECS and the pro rata payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before us today in the context of this bill, the government is seeking to introduce some further revenue grabbing measures that students need to be aware of. In particular, I refer to part 4 of the bill, which makes provision for a discount to be offered to persons who voluntarily commence to repay their HECS debt when on an income of $20,000. Of course, the current threshold at which HECS must be paid is $26,853. Not surprisingly, the National Union of Students has expressed fears that this could be the first step towards the government lowering the compulsory repayment threshold. What a tragedy that would be under a Labor government which is supposed to be looking after their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the bill provides for three new repayment thresholds for HECS. These new threshold levels, at 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent and six per cent, will be inserted within the existing levels of three per cent, four per cent and five per cent, effectively accelerating the rate of repayment. Students around Australia should note that it was a Labor government that introduced this measure to increase HECS revenue by stealth. Once again, it is a Labor government that is changing the rules on students and on recent graduates by now asking them to pay back more of their debt at a faster rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this is the second time in three years that Labor has sought to accelerate the rate of repayment of HECS. This altering of the rules is of great concern. A graduate battling to buy a house, to marry or to establish a career can suddenly find that his or her HECS debt repayments are suddenly increased, causing financial hardship and stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is in the House. I know that, from my own children and many friends' children, by the time students get to the end of their undergraduate courses they are very much strapped for cash. They are seeking to pay off a car or, as I have said before, they may be trying to buy a house or a unit, to marry or to establish a career. The coalition will move an amendment to part 5 of the bill to ensure that the new student threshold levels will apply to only those students who commence their studies from 1996 onwards. What we are about is creating certainty for students&mdash;not changing the rules here and there to suit the government's budget shortfalls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 9 of the bill requires permanent residents, including New Zealand citizens, who have met the residency requirements of citizenship one year or more before enrolment to pay up-front fees&mdash;in other words, to prevent persons from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving without ever paying their HECS debt. This seems to be fair and logical, but that is hardly the way the government has gone about achieving that aim. Like for part 5 of the bill, we will move an amendment to this measure to ensure it does not affect students already enrolled but so that future students&mdash;that is, from 1996 onwards&mdash;are aware of the new rules, are aware of what they will be paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HECS hoax is something I would also like to talk about. Interestingly, these two minor coalition amendments to parts 5 and 9 of the HECS bill, designed to give students greater certainty, is the source of angst, which has been generated by an extraordinary reaction by Labor politicians, both state and federal, to the coalition's measures. The coalition has been accused of politicking and threatening Queensland's hard won university places. I might depart from my notes for a minute to read a lemming-like letter from my state colleague Mr Campbell, the Labor member for Bundaberg, who says in heightening this scare campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hundreds of teenagers' hopes and aspirations will be dashed in the Bundaberg region unless the Opposition relent and allow Mr Crean's changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Member for Hinkler Paul Neville has denied the claim&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as indeed I do here. Joining the lemmings going over the cliff is the state minister, Mr Hamill, who said in support of the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes were part of a higher education package to raise an extra $20 million to defray the costs of the 12,000 extra tertiary places for Queensland, the total number of places phased in over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hamill made his comments after talks in Canberra with his federal counterpart, Simon Crean. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of final year students throughout Queensland are this week writing their applications for positions at our universities in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>This is recent stuff. That is terrible intimidation, terrible stuff, Minister. I am surprised that your colleagues would fall for such a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been accused of politicking and threatening hard won university places, but I think you would agree with me that we are talking about $20 million at the end of the scale. That's funny: it has been claimed that the coalition, rather than the federal minister, is taking away these extra places. You have been going around the country and you have been quoted in Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane as threatening to cut university places because you cannot have your way on these minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET estimates that the coalition's amendments could cost the government about $20 million over three years in forgone revenue. That is $20 million less the government would be able to rake in from students' pockets if the bill remained unchanged. On the face of it, $20 million sounds a lot of money. But, when you talk about $20 million in the totality of the higher education budget of $4.4 billion, you are talking about roughly less than half of one per cent. In case the minister or his Labor colleagues have not heard, most Queensland universities, especially regional institutions such as Central Queensland University, are still not happy with the original allocation because they have simply not received enough places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the third Labor myth which I seek to dispel, and that is in relation to university places. The student to population ratio in my Central Queensland electorate was, until recently, less than half the national average. With the minister's new allocation&mdash;if indeed it takes place, if this threat is not invoked&mdash;it will be about 60 per cent of the national average; yet my region continues to be grossly under-funded in terms of university places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the government's much heralded budget allocation of 4,200 extra university places over three years, the Central Queensland University appears to me not to be getting its fair share of the funding cake. Our allocations for 1996 and 1997 were 420 extra places; but 100 of these were announced previously by the minister's predecessor, Kim Beazley. So, out of the recent budget, CQU got 320 places over two years to be distributed between five campuses. Think about that, Minister: two years, five campuses&mdash;10 units, if you like&mdash;into 320 places. It is not big. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It becomes even more frightening when you look at today's unemployment figures from the ABS. In the Central Queensland area and, in particular, in the Wide Bay-Burnett region, which is in the southern part of my electorate and which has one of the campuses of CQU, we find that the youth unemployment figure for 15- to 19-year-olds is 41.1 per cent, which is the worst in Queensland. For 20- to 24-year-olds it is 23.4 per cent, which is the worst in Queensland. Total unemployment spread over all the state and all age groups is at 15.9 per cent, up from 14.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I acknowledge that an increase in university places would have only a minor effect on this, and while I appreciate that the minister has said he will cooperate with me on unemployment and workplace measures to alleviate this problem, nevertheless we could do with more university places. There is an interesting quote from Professor Geoff Wilson, who wrote to me recently. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A considerable proportion of these students could be expected to enrol at a campus within the region if the option was made available to them through the allocation of additional funded places at Central Queensland University.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, 320 places over five campuses over two years is not a big deal. Indeed we are grateful for them, but I think we can do more. How, on such a paltry number and with Queensland still so far behind the other states, could you threaten to withdraw them if you do not get your way on those two minor amendments? I find that very hard to understand. I quote again from a recent letter to me from the Vice-Chancellor of Central Queensland University, Professor Wilson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Central Queensland University would need a doubling of its 1995 allocation of funded student load in order to provide the population of the Central Queensland region with same availability of higher education places on a per capita basis within the region, at the current Australian average.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, whilst the Ministers recent announcement of additional funded places being allocated to Central Queensland University over the coming triennium has been most welcome, this still goes only a small way toward overcoming the shortfall in the region-base provision which I have highlighted above.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think Professor Wilson could have said it much more clearly than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Queensland institutions are still grossly underfunded, and now the government wants to play games over the future of other university places. As I said before, Minister: how could you threaten, over these two amendments, this package in Queensland? I know you have threatened in Brisbane, in Melbourne and in Adelaide as well. Nevertheless, it came home very potently to the people of my region who felt that it was a form of intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by way of comparison, we are talking about $20 million, after having been told over recent years how tough the budget was, and all these sorts of things. While I do not for a minute deny the right of the arts community to funding, out of the blue you recently plucked $250 million&mdash;just like that: superhighway and arts, $250 million! Yet, if you do not get your way on these amendments, you are threatening to cut university places in Queensland and presumably in the other places where you have issued the threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the bill before us today and the measures it contains will send a clear message to tertiary students right around Australia. That message is that Labor is more interested in finding new and more devious ways to get students to pay for their education, rather than listening to the real problems and needs of our tertiary sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill should dispel once and for all the great myth that only Labor will look after the interests of students. Students need only examine the coalition's actions in regard to the bill to understand that there is a choice other than Labor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me start by reminding the House that this government has done more for higher education in this country than any other government. I quote Professor Alan Gilbert, who is currently Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania but soon to take up the position as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. In a speech he made when joining me in opening the Burnie campus in Tasmania on 15 September, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that when the history is written accurately one of the main things said about the government that has been in power since 1983 is that it has done more for education and for higher education I think than any government in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA>I noted the disbelief of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) when I quoted this on a previous occasion. But the opposition should recognise that even the critics of government policy are able to recognise what this government has done for higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to summarise it: we have been in power since 1983 and we have seen the total number of students in higher education increase by 68 per cent&mdash;from 350,000 places to almost 600,000 places. That was the position before the last budget. In the last budget, we have demonstrated that we are not prepared just to rest on our laurels, as impressive as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone even further with the last budget. We have committed $16 1/2 billion to higher education over the next three and a half years; we have increased the number of places by 5,850 which, when you take the pipeline effect, means 11,000 more places over the course of the next 3 1/2 years; in addition, we have provided $109 million on top of the existing $191 million for research infrastructure&mdash;an increase of 57 per cent; and we have provided an additional $40 million for research programs, on top of the $350 million already committed for the triennium. We did all of this against the background of a tight fiscal set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not cut funding to higher education. We did not introduce up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. We did not reallocate existing places from one state to another. We honoured our commitments in relation to HECS so far as Australian students are concerned. We did not increase the size of the HECS burden&mdash;the debt. We did not lower the first compulsory repayment threshold below average weekly earnings, and we did not introduce a differential HECS. It was another confirmation of our huge commitment to this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a package that was funded by two basic approaches. First, there was a reallocation of existing funds available to higher education through the National Priority (Reserve) Fund. Second, there were some savings measures introduced, two of which are under attack today by the opposition. The resultant package reflected what became known as a cocktail approach to funding the higher education sector, and it was developed in full consultation with the higher education sector last year and this year. It was embraced by them as the sensible way forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I remind the House: it was Labor that undertook the consultation. Despite what the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) said about listening to the higher education sector, the opposition consulted no-one when they took this stance of opposing the amendments. They did not consult the AVCC, which  has welcomed the package and which has since attacked the opposition for the very things that they are opposing. They did not consult the academic bodies, which again welcomed the package. Even the students, while opposing the citizenship measure, recognised the strength of the package before the House. The opposition claim the right to represent the sector, but they will not even talk to it. As a consequence, this package is now in danger of being unravelled by the Liberal Party. It is opportunism at its best; it is policy at its very worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is seeking to undermine two important funding areas. Its proposals are a direct attack on the places which have been secured for those Australians who have not had the opportunity to go to university. Again, I will correct the member for Hinkler. The savings measures risks involve up to $20 million per year&mdash;not over three years. It is $50 million over three years. I do not know who has been feeding him the information on his side of the House, but $50 million is not an insignificant amount. It will see 2,000 places in jeopardy.The new places in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania will have to be reduced and places reallocated from Victoria and South Australia. So to the member for Hinkler I say: do not come in here crying crocodile tears about needing to get extra places in your own area, which has been a beneficiary of the new places we have offered. Do not come in crying crocodile tears and supporting this nonsense on your side of the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity to visit the member for Hinkler's electorate over the last couple of months and to visit that university. These new places will enable students to complete the full three years of a degree in Bundaberg for the first time. They were not able to do it before. These are the places you are now putting at risk. I do not think you understand the consequences of what you and those on your side of the House are really supporting. The opposition can talk intimidation all they like, but I am not playing politics in this regard. If the money is not there, how do we fund the additional places? I had to put this package together on the basis of reallocating within my portfolio. I had to do it on the basis of finding savings that came back to my portfolio, and I did what the sector did not believe could be achieved. Now you want to come in on the back of it and unravel it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cocktail approach developed in the resource allocation consultations last year also proposed the reallocation of places from those states with higher levels of participation. They could not see that we could actually get the extra money to give Queensland its places without taking those places off South Australia and Victoria. That set of proposals in the cocktail mix did raise considerable concern from those two latter states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian education minister made strong representations to me, arguing against the possibility of reallocating up to 10,000 places from Victoria. The South Australian minister wrote to me, similarly concerned that they would lose 3,000 places. But they lost none under our package. We did not reallocate one existing place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the other day the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) was also in the House&mdash;part of the bleeding heart brigade, like the member for Hinkler&mdash;crying crocodile tears about concern in her state. She quoted in relation to the resource allocation discussion and referred to it in her speech. She called for greater allocation and flexibility of resources between institutions. Yet, do you know what the member for Adelaide did, when it came to really considering these issues? She made a very explicit call for places not to be removed from her state. In other words, she was saying, `We understand that if we take this step there will be a loss of places, but don't take them from Adelaide.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can she pretend to represent the interests of students in her seat and in her state and yet agree with an opposition stance on this bill that will see places cut?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of this citizenship issue, let me just state the record to the House. Migrants to this country have immediate access to the higher education system. Under the proposed legislation they have three years in which to take out citizenship. That is three years&mdash;I remind the House that it is possible to complete a degree in three years&mdash;for which they can defer HECS. And on top of that they can also be eligible for Austudy. No other country in the world is as generous as we are in relation to non-citizens. We are miles in front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind the House that no Australian citizen could go to any other country in the world and enter universities under the same conditions as we allow people to enter them here. Indeed, British, US and New Zealand citizens, who will be the major focus of this measure, cannot even get back into their own countries' universities under the same conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense to imply that you are really protecting something that is not already generous. I do not think that you understand the full implications of what you are going in to bat for on this issue. You are proposing to further protect an already generous proposition&mdash;a world leading proposition&mdash;but, by doing it, you will be denying Australian citizens. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand the logic of a party that will support measures that benefit people who do not even vote in this country. You would do it at the expense of people who vote here, who have been born here and who want to grow up and live in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also nonsense to imply that the measure itself is the beginning of up-front fees for Australian higher education. Our proposal does not require non-citizens to pay full fees for their university education. They will only pay up-front HECS. As we all know, HECS is equivalent to only one-fifth of average course costs. The Australian taxpayer pays the other four-fifths for these people who are non-citizens and, through HECS, funds are returned to the higher education system for the provision of additional places&mdash;places for Australian students. So why should we not make non-citizens do the same?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, a person who has come over here, studied for three years and got a degree can avoid payment of anything back into the system if they leave before earning any income. Don't you understand that that is the consequence of what we are doing now? Having got all the benefits out of the system, they can get out of the country without paying anything, having no obligation back to this country and to the higher education system. Australian students cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a case of double standards on your part. On the one hand, the member for Goldstein says permanent residents who are not Australian citizens should not have to pay their HECS up front, yet he then complains that overseas students are taking places from Australian students. He is on the record as saying that 40,000 overseas students are taking up places in our Australian universities while the Australian students find the doors barred against them. That is absolute nonsense because he knows that the overseas students pay full fees, 100 per cent fees, to enter our universities. They do not do it at the expense of our students because universities require them to pay the full cost of the degree, including the capital costs. The students who pay to come to this country from overseas to study are not subsidised by public funds in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does raise the interesting question of what we should read into the member for Goldstein's statement in this regard. Is he really saying that Australian students should be allowed to pay fees as do overseas students? I think he is, because he believes that. That is why he was dumped as the shadow spokesman for education after the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a radio interview in March this year, Senator Hill indicated that the coalition had changed its policy away from fees because unmet demand had dropped. I asked at the time if this meant that if unmet demand should rise again the opposition would introduce fees. We still have not had a reply. That was in March. But we know it would, because it believes it. It wants to charge students to go to university. It does not believe in a fully publicly funded university approach in this country, which we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the opposition really saying through this set of measures that it has the students' interests at heart? It is obfuscating. It is misleading them and it will never support them. History shows that it has not done so. I believe it owes the students an explanation. It claims that Australian students are paying fees for undergraduate education. I issue the same invitation to the opposition as I have to the students who have made this allegation: provide me with the information on courses for which undergraduate fees are being charged. They still have not provided any evidence of their assertions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech I made to the Victorian Young Labor conference earlier this year, I indicated that I would ask my department to raise any questionable activities with relevant universities and I have indicated a preparedness to take action in relation to any information coming forward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just setting the scene. As far as the Clinton administration's position on the poor in the United States is concerned, the whole position in the United States was put most effectively by the US Labor secretary in recent times. Whilst there had been a slightly better employment performance in the United States than in Europe at that gathering at the OECD where he held these discussions, when you looked at the situation of wages in the United States you had to say there was an extraordinarily large number of working poor and that poverty was a very substantial problem in that nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Before he jumped on that international charter flight up to Jakarta, fleeing the blockade yesterday, Mr Kierath decided to set the record straight. In the report, he insists that nothing has changed about his industrial relations proposals since he developed them four full long years ago. He said that nothing has changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a product of some banter, is it? The honourable member is an expert in banter. I have already answered this question once publicly today, which is fair enough. I will go through it again here, which is fair enough too. The position with the Governor-General's finances is that the office is responsible, like any other government department or agency, for its own administration within the framework of guidelines by the Department of Finance. As far as we are concerned, there are no problems with the administration within the framework of the guidelines that are laid down by them. The finance department does not administer the departments of the Commonwealth. It is obviously ridiculous to assume that it does. All the restrictions that apply via those guidelines apply to the Governor-General's Office. For example, they are subject to the efficiency dividend in their running costs, as are the other departments which are responsible in observing Department of Finance guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a chance to look at the article in the newspapers today. The answers to the story go reasonably as follows: firstly, there was obviously no account taken by the journalist concerned of the ordinary increases in expenditure that flow from wage increases and general increases in the cost of living. They have the same deflator that applies to most of the other departments. A substantial amount of the additional expenditure can be explained by that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, a substantial proportion of the differences between the period of time that Mr Hayden has been in office and that of his predecessors goes to renovations of Government House. Those renovations are determined from time to time as required by an Official Establishments Trust which works out how to keep our old public buildings in decent operation. They are not a benefit to the Governor-General. They are not renovations of his private property; they are renovations of the property of the Australian people. Obviously, those renovations of old places like the Governor-General's residence and establishment are from time to time likely to be substantial and do explain most of the expenditure additional to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one or two other items. I am advised that the Governor-General no longer utilises as personal aides members of the defence forces, so a slight increase in the civilian establishment has been associated with that. Other expenditures that were drawn to our attention by the article go to the utilisation of a 707 for a recent trip to the 80th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. That was an entirely appropriate occasion for the Governor-General to attend. That trip was accompanied by a swing through Indo-China, where he was, of course, representing Australian interests and concerns. Clearly, it was convenient for him, in those circumstances where it is difficult to travel in that region, to operate with an Australian government jet. The notion that he is, in some way or another, personally advantaged by taking a 707 as opposed to sitting in the front of a Qantas jet again draws a long bow. All of us here have been in the government 707s from time to time.</PARA>

I am a personal witness to your trooping aboard the 707s. You can't escape that. I will swear on a stack of Bibles that I saw you all. The fact is that nobody could conceivably say that the front end of a Qantas jet is not better than travelling in the 707s. I only make the point in passing. It was an appropriate use of that aircraft by the Governor-General.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are very concerned that . . . that through the coalition's industrial relations program, that wages are going to be cut. Now, that . . . that is a concern out there in the community, it's got to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>This was issued the day before the Leader of the Opposition attended the ACOSS conference. He had the opportunity to set the record straight, but he did not. He squibbed it. It is true that what he did was to rule out a $3 per hour minimum rate, which was such a disastrous policy for you at the last election. But what we do know is that the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow spokesman are committed to reintroducing Jobsback. The Leader of the Opposition said in November last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like all policies, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jobsback!</EMPHASIS> industrial relations document is being reviewed in the wake of the 1993 election defeat. Its essential thrust will not change. Its main principles are timeless. If anything, they are even more relevant to contemporary economic challenges.</PARA>
<PARA>So the substance of Jobsback is still the coalition policy. Let me just remind the House of what the substance of Jobsback means for wages. They are committed to reintroducing Austrain. Austrain is something the shadow spokesman has spoken with praise about. But what does Austrain involve? If people have been out of work for six months, their wages will be cut by 10 per cent. If they have been out of work for 12 months, they will be cut by 20 per cent. If they have been out of work for 18 months, they will be cut by 25 per cent. Apart from cutting the rate, which is what Austrain would do, there is no requirement under Austrain to actually train the person or to give accreditation and recognition to training already undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's position in relation to youth wages is shameless. They think that they have covered themselves because they have ruled out the $3 per hour minimum rate.

It is not what the opposition have said; it is what they will not say. The simple truth is that under John Howard youth wages will be cut.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to put on record the position in relation to youth unemployment. The number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest level since April 1990. In September it fell by almost 3,000 to 88,500. Over the year to September the number of teenagers looking for full-time work fell by 6,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full-time unemployment rate for teenagers fell from 28 per cent in August to 26.7 per cent in September. As a proportion of the total&mdash;note that: total&mdash;15- to 19-year-old population, teenage unemployment fell from 7.2 per cent to seven per cent. As acknowledged over the last few days by a number of commentators, rates of youth unemployment are confusing and misleading as to the state of the youth labour market. They are therefore inappropriate as the basis for a target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly our aim is to reduce the number of 88,500 teenagers looking for full-time work, and we are clearly making headway. When we came back to power in 1983, do you know how many teenagers were out of work when John Howard left them? There were 158,000. Today it is 88,000&mdash;44 per cent lower. So don't give us this hypocrisy on your side of the House about doing something for the youth unemployed; it is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, even though we have dropped the number by 44 per cent, the unemployment rate itself, as measured by the statistician, has remained pretty much the same. The reason for that is that the number of teenagers available for work has declined dramatically. We have seen many more stay on to complete year 12 and many more go into TAFE or into universities&mdash;all because this government has funded the capacity for them to do so and all because we recognise that the jobs that used to employ people in the 1970s and early 1980s, the unskilled jobs, do not exist anymore.

This government is committed to growth in TAFE, it is committed to growth in higher education and there will be fewer people available for the labour market. The issue in terms of youth unemployment is not the publication of figures; it is having policies in place that will address the problem and it is recognising that a person's employability is enhanced by the fact that they are trained and they are skilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policies are ensuring that they get that necessary training and skilling. That is the reason why the youth groups that have met with me are more interested in developing the way forward with us than they are with you. Getting that information is not an issue of freedom of information. You can roll on over to the Bureau of Statistics, get the information and make of it what you want.

The fact is that the teenage pregnancy rate has halved in this country since sole parent support was introduced in the 1970s, unlike in the United States where the rate of teenage pregnancy has increased quite substantially. So the suggestion that the existence of some sort of income support structure leads to a proliferation of teenage pregnancy is a demonstrably false proposition. Of course, the government has done a range of other things that the member for Mackellar and others have failed to acknowledge.

But that 14 per cent was not the half of it. What you had to do was cocktail it to get to anything like a situation where your deposit was likely to meet the amount that you had to borrow. In cocktailing those loans, you were taking your interest rates well over 14 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

In comparing our position here with your position when you were in office, the situation of borrowers for home loans now is vastly better.</PARA>

We know that it cannot be a policy, of course, because when the Leader of the Opposition farewelled his colleagues on their blunder-bus tour a few weeks ago, he admitted that he could not set any targets for youth unemployment because he did not have any policies. It certainly does appear to be part of a campaign of lies about vocational education and training.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor's track record, the document states that the number of young Australians in employment based training&mdash;that is, apprenticeships and traineeships&mdash;is at its lowest level for three decades.

It is totally wrong and it is high time that those who were putting it around were well and truly nailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that three decades ago apprenticeship commencements stood at some 29,000 nationally. Commencements for 1994-95 were just over 53,000 and when we add the commencements for traineeships, which were introduced in 1995, we have almost 70,000 people entering workplace training. In the last year the coalition was in office, commencements were 34,794&mdash;less than half of today's figures. I have a graph that shows that. Here we are; there you were. I table the graph. You could not defend a record like the opposition's because it is so pathetic.

I cite as justification for this request section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which is listed on page 954 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> which says in part that contempt is recognised if conduct constitutes an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also recommend, when you consider this request, that you review the Coleman case which is listed on page 706 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> and the advice about the obstruction of officers of the House in the execution of their duty or other people employed by the House, or entrusted with the execution of its orders, or the molestation of those people on account of their having carried out their duties, constitutes contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of concern is that thousands of Australians, particularly in Western Australia but quite possibly Australia-wide, have been and quite possibly continue to be denied telephone access and possibly access by correspondence to many federal MPs and possibly therefore to government agencies and departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that some MPs belonging to the Labor Party have been and possibly will be prevented and impeded from performing their duties as elected representatives of the people and, tragically, may also be acquiescing in all of this contempt. I raise as support of my request an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, written by Mr Randal Markey and published on Saturday, 7 October. I refer you to the article. I will not read it out but I will quote it in small part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Community and Public Sector Union, which represents staff in MPs' offices, has accused Assistant Treasurer George Gear of failing to comply with work bans over a pay dispute.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"No other electorate office in WA (including those of Ministers) is failing to follow these bans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I would urge you to support our action as your other WA Federal colleagues are."</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gear said that it was not helping him hang on to his seat of Canning, which he holds by only 240 votes. He also said he did not tell his office staff what to do. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA Labor Senator Jim McKiernan said the bans were frustrating and would be counter-productive in trying to address the Government's loss of support among blue-collar workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I also submit a fax message sent to my office from a staffer of the President of the Senate. On receipt of this fax the staff in my electorate office expressed anger and the feeling of having been intimidated by it, or at least the threat of intimidation. The fax read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To all SCABS, We are fighting for all Electorate Staff so why don't you help us to succeed for you as well. Please support us.</PARA>
<PARA>The contact number was in fact the President of the Senate's office. The action taken by the union and some staff members of ALP federal members amounts to a breach of privilege and contempt and should not be permitted to continue or happen again. For some time the offices of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), plus the offices of Senators Beahan, Cook and Evans and others, have had answering machines advising of no immediate contact being available due to industrial disputation. I am advised that even today this practice continues in some offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cut off access and deny the people their right of access to their elected federal member for assistance on important and urgent matters and other issues is outrageous and scandalous and should be stopped. Furthermore, the action of the minister, the member for Canning, in seemingly acquiescing in this virtual thuggery and saying `he did not tell his office staff what to do' is a frightening admission by a minister of the Crown. The concept that ordinary Australians, battlers, can be cut off from making contact with their member of parliament to seek redress and advice is outrageous and is a startling admission that a federal member of parliament's work is and can be impeded by a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, whilst not denying anyone the opportunity to withdraw their labour if appropriate or denying a much justified pay increase for our overworked staff, I ask that you consider the matter in light of section 4 of the act and refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. I seek leave to table copies of the article and the fax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a government that has become very long indeed on rhetoric about things like social justice, regional development, boosting exports, even retaining the family farm. We hear about how that is important for economic and social reasons now from none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But there is in fact a huge gulf between rhetoric and reality. As, in the broader context in Australia, the rich get richer and the poor become more numerous, the same is happening in rural Australia. Many of those more numerous poor are rural Australians, our wealth creators, those who provide the overwhelming base for our export performance, and those who, in these increasingly environmentally conscious times, ought to be seen and recognised as the custodians of our natural resource base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, thanks to the government, thanks to that policy drift, their inertia, their reform fatigue, what we really see, despite the rhetoric, in rural and regional Australia is increasing dislocation, increasing poverty, increasing loss of job opportunities, and nowhere do we see these problems more evident than amongst young people in the country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see anecdotal and real evidence of young men leaving the bush in droves and young women leaving even faster. Tragically, it is often the most talented people with the most to offer for the future, the people who will be most needed in the future in rural Australia, who are leaving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is no exception. We have noted something of a contraction in the size of the work force in Gwydir since the recession set in over the last couple of years of some 4,500 people&mdash;many of them young people, many of them skilled, many of them people who will be needed when things turn around. This is despite the fact that two of Australia's wealthiest agricultural shires are in my electorate&mdash;Narrabri and Gunnedah. In the case of Moree, this is reflected in the town by the unbelievable number of vacant homes that are on the market&mdash;no purchaser available. In Gunnedah, a couple of hundred homes in what is not a very big town do not even have the power turned on any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an explosion of farm debt, but the government over the past 13 years has refused to do anything about arresting that decline in our rural fortunes. This has had a significant impact on job opportunities and returns for efforts made in rural Australia. We have seen farm debt go from $7 billion when this mob came to power to $17 1/2 billion today. Again, the young are unduly affected. They are giving up hope and questioning their role in the so-called lucky country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we heard some statistics from our spokesman in this area about the unemployment of youth; that is, those from 15 to 20 years old. The national youth unemployment rate is 28 per cent. That is a disgrace. Look at what is happening in country regions. I understand that in one district of the Mallee area the youth unemployment rate is about 66 per cent. Two-thirds of the young people in that area do not have a job. The Wide Bay-Burnett region has a youth unemployment rate of 41 1/2 per cent. The central west of New South Wales has a youth unemployment rate of 32 per cent. In central Queensland that figure is nearly 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures probably disguise the reality. It is probably worse in many of those areas but it is covered up by various programs which are designed to disguise the full extent of the real problem and to train people for jobs that tragically will often not be there. Why will they not be there? Because the government is severely inflicted with reform fatigue. Murdoch was spot on when he said that Australia's economy is a disgrace. Didn't he stir up a hornet's nest when he talked about youth unemployment? We saw a mad scramble from those opposite trying to discredit what he had to say. It is very interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in the bush are losing hope. There is a loss of belief by country people, our wealth creators, in their future just when the experts are now widely beginning to talk about a bright future. A little while ago, Graham Blight made reference here in Canberra to that fact. Graham Blight is well known and well respected in this place. He predicted that agriculture would be back at the forefront of governments' agendas in coming years for very good reason. He pointed to the fact that by the year 2025, when I will be 68&mdash;it is not so far away, in 30 years time&mdash;the world will need another 300 million tonnes of wheat a year just to feed itself, another 260 million tonnes of corn, another 210 million tonnes of rice and another 16 million tonnes of fish. Imagine the fibre that we will need to clothe people and the material that we will need to put roofs over our heads globally. Let us put all that into perspective: the biggest crop that Australia, as the world's second biggest exporter of wheat, ever grew was just 22 million tonnes in 1982-83. We will have to find another 300 million tonnes in 30 years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing about this problem? There is policy paralysis, drift, a loss of hope and a loss of direction. We are giving away our best talent&mdash;the bush&mdash;at the very time when we ought to be giving it positive direction and confidence and when we should be telling people that there is a future, because there is. But what are we doing? We are seeing the government destroy the heartland of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just Labor in this place that is destroying our heartland. Their cohorts in Queensland and New South Wales are also contributing to the problem. There is an appalling lack of consultation on matters such as SEPP46, the state environmental planning policy. There is no consultation with the people at the coalface, the people who actually have stewardship over the environment. They just say, `Here's what you'll do. Here's how you'll do it. We'll control you. We won't give you the freedom to go out and act in the best long-term interests of either your industry or the people who will follow you in it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to forestry. What an absolute debacle, what an absolute mess, we have seen from those opposite. Investment is drying up, and there is one indication of that. We hear all their talk about growing a bigger timber and paper products industry. Whilst they talk about it here, it actually happens in New Zealand. They will establish 100,000 hectares of softwood plantation this year. In Australia it is estimated that 8,000 hectares will be established. Some 100,000 hectares will be established there while 8,000 hectares will be established here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the difference in the job opportunities? What is the opportunity for value adding wood and timber paper products in this country? Unlimited. This year, 40 per cent of the timber and paper product needs of New South Wales alone will be imported&mdash;across the nation, it is $3 billion worth&mdash;and that figure is growing rapidly. How much investment is on hold because of the uncertainty? Around $2 billion worth in value adding of our product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government doing about it? Well, it is slashed across the papers every morning, isn't it: total and absolute chaos. When we ought to be talking about more opportunities, more jobs, more plantations and more timber, what are we doing? We are shutting the thing down to the huge disadvantage&mdash;again, let me emphasise this&mdash;not just of country people and young people in the bush but of the nation's economic performance. In case you had not noticed&mdash;and here is one of the ministers who is very good on spending money&mdash;we have to generate wealth in this country if we are to then distribute it. And here we are again undermining the people who need to be encouraged to invest, to employ people and to produce a bigger cake so that there is more to go around for everyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of competitiveness. The tyranny of distance is a great problem. I have to touch on this. I cannot resist it as my opposite number over there keeps talking about how he has reformed Australia's waterfront. A recent study was carried out of 46 ports around the world. Although we have spent $400 million since 1989, the beginning of the government's reform program, what has actually happened? Sydney has slipped from 24th to 31st and Melbourne has gone from 28th to 37th in terms of world competitiveness. Did you hear the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) guffaw when I accused the government of having reform fatigue? Did you hear it? It is wonderful, isn't it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help but mention something we ought to be very proud of in this country: we are the world's No. 1 exporter of beef product. But you know what? Such is your reform fatigue that we are no longer competitive at home. The first rule of being an effective trading nation in any given commodity is to make sure that you are competitive at home. But what do we find in the case of the beef industry? We are not competitive at home. So how are we ever going to make it? We have got American and New Zealand product on our shelves. How are we ever going to make it in the important Asian markets to our north if we cannot do our best here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the industry is on its knees at the moment and, with it, the wellbeing of thousands of producers. And here is the rub for you blokes: so are tens of thousands of Australian workers. We have had report after report and study after study which have clearly indicated that we are grossly underperforming to such an extent that the only reason we are competitive on world markets at all is that our beef producers receive as little as half of what their opposite numbers in New Zealand and America get. For years the government has ignored time and again the problem&mdash;although the government did decide a couple of years ago that they would have their own industry commission look at this whole issue again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the commission had to say was really very interesting. The first thing it said was that we are competitive only because of the low prices paid to Australian producers. It went on to say a few other things that members opposite might be interested in. One is that change has been painfully slow and that greater industrial relations flexibility and productivity are the key to the industry's future. But here is the bit that is really interesting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has found that greater flexibility, particularly greater use of enterprise agreements, could bring about significant productivity gains with benefits for . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Who would you expect would get the benefits? Farmers? The nation? Do you know who the commission nominated first? The workers of this country. The first who would benefit are the workers&mdash;then the producers, the processors and, after that, some consumers, as the commission put it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reported in another place that, if we could pick up the hundreds of billions of dollars that are out there to be gained by some improved performance, the benefit to workers would be about 25 per cent of that better return. What did the government do with all this? It sat on it for 14 months. There were 23 major recommendations, and the government picked up one, basically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 14 months the government introduced some legislation into the second chamber in this place. This is Australia's major agricultural export industry, except when wool overtakes it occasionally. How importantly did the government regard the reform process? Perhaps it is reflected in the fact they picked up just one of 23 recommendations and introduced it on a day when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) was not even in Australia. It was appropriate that he was in America on that day. That is fine, but the government had 14 months in which to choose a day when the minister would be here to introduce it. But, no, they did not, and so it goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we raised enterprise bargaining with them, which they claimed had basically been put in place in the industry&mdash;you heard it again from the minister here&mdash;he said, `That's fixed it all up. We don't need to address the other areas here.' And it just so happened that on that day something had fallen off the back of a truck: an independent report on the Department of Primary Industries and Energy which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to this industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is a matter of only weeks old even now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with some exceptions, progress has generally been limited, with little to show in terms of widespread and quantifiable increases in productivity and efficiency. The [general nature of] enterprise bargains achieved to date have not been particularly innovative or successful in encouraging improvements . . . In many cases, they have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase.</PARA>
<PARA>So there you go&mdash;abysmal failure in one of Australia's most important regional industries and most important export industries. Confronted with the evidence from his independent report, Senator Collins over in the other place&mdash;and this is very interesting; this is just two weeks ago&mdash;went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . AMH is engaged right now in its abattoirs at Rockhampton in an exercise to do just that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>improve work practices&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in cooperation with the unions and under the supervision of the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I think he meant the Industrial Relations Commission. That is really very interesting. For years and years they can ignore the reform process at the cost of workers, at the cost of the industry and at the possible demise now of the industry; but in the space of two weeks they can act when a complaint comes in from the other side. I reckon that is an enormous vote of no confidence in your system in general and an enormous vote of no confidence in the commission in particular, because they were meant to be overseeing this. In short, the whole process is nothing short of a national disgrace. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I have been a minister in this government every MPI from the opposition I have debated has been based on a false premise. Today's MPI is no exception. Not only is today's MPI based on a false premise but also there has been an array of falsehoods asserted in the speech we have just heard. I intend to return to a few of those towards the end of my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MPI refers to the question of job security. It is the case that this country has had one of the most rapid rates of job growth in the entire OECD over a period of several years. In the year to the three months to July&mdash;in other words, the most recent quarter for which statistics are available from the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;employment growth in Australia as a whole was 4.4 per cent. This represented 347,000 new jobs in Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of the MPI is that rural and regional Australia has missed out on its fair share of that employment growth. What are the facts? The facts are that employment growth in non-metropolitan Australia was much stronger than the average. In fact, in the non-metropolitan area employment growth totalled no less than 6.2 per cent over that period, which is almost twice as great as the 3.4 per cent job growth recorded in metropolitan Australia. That is the first point: rural and regional Australia have shared very substantially in the exceptionally strong job growth that has gone on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 347,000 jobs created in Australia in the course of that year, 170,000 of them&mdash;that is, almost half&mdash;were in non-metropolitan areas. Indeed in all states, except Victoria and Western Australia&mdash;and it is interesting to note that the opposition spokesman and Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), somehow tried to blame Labor state governments for the poor performance&mdash;more than 50 per cent of the job growth was outside the capital city. Guess which political parties are in office in those two states!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, this is not a short-term trend. It is a trend that has been occurring throughout our term of office. It is true that there is considerable variation in unemployment across regional Australia, just as there is considerable variation in unemployment across metropolitan Australia. The Deputy Leader of the National Party's own region, which is north and central west New South Wales, has a rate of 6.6 per cent, which is well below the national average of more than eight per cent. In the Murray-Murrumbidgee area of New South Wales unemployment was as low as 4.4 per cent. The highest level of unemployment in Australia is not in non-metropolitan Australia, it is in western Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course what matters about unemployment is the policies to reduce it. We are reducing unemployment. Unemployment has fallen in almost all the regions of non-metropolitan Australia. We gave the economy a fiscal kick-start, which the opposition opposed, from the recession. We are maintaining an accord which has provided a framework that has facilitated strong employment growth. The opposition has opposed that. We have introduced the job compact to provide a fundamental structural change in the labour market in favour of job growth, and particularly job growth opportunities for the disadvantaged in the labour market. The opposition has opposed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the MPI today is from the political party that believes people who live in regional Australia are not part of a broader Australian nation. The National Party has always pretended that somehow regional Australians do not have the same interests as other Australians, which is a nonsense. Moreover, the National Party has always believed that the only people of worth in regional Australia are primary producers and other small business operators. They want to pretend that the indigenous population does not exist, that the social security recipients in regional Australia do not exist and that wage and salary earners in regional Australia do not exist. </PARA>

It is interesting that the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) raises this issue about the youth unemployment statistics. The speech we have just heard from the National Party spokesman is a clear illustration of the way in which those youth unemployment statistics are abused. He said that in certain regions two-thirds of young people in that age group are out of work. The statistics do not show any such thing and you know that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, nobody is suggesting that for a minute. But what we are saying is that you have to interpret these statistics correctly. What we are talking about is that, in the 15- to 19-year-old age group, around about nine per cent&mdash;obviously far too high still, and nobody disputes that for a minute&mdash;are out of work, actively seeking work. All these figures you quote fail to take into account that basic point: in interpreting these statistics, the great bulk of young people are appropriately in the education and training system.</PARA></TALK.START>

The government's economic policies have centred on making Australia a more competitive nation. Which industries are the beneficiaries of that? The most competitive ones, of course, which are mining, agriculture, downstream processing and tourism, among others. Where are they primarily located? In regional Australia. The government's social policies have ensured that the benefits of the economic growth generated by these economic policies have been equitably distributed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just made the point that, if anything, in terms of employment growth, regional Australia has done substantially better in proportionate terms than metropolitan Australia. Don't the pensioners in regional Australia benefit from the 12 per cent real increase in the value of the pension when measured against the consumer price index? Of course they do. I have not had time to check the figures, but I imagine that pensioners are over-represented in non-metropolitan Australia, given the relative attractiveness of the non-metropolitan lifestyle to many older people. That means that our policies of increased adequacy and financial security for pensioners benefit regional Australia more widely. Don't the low income families in regional Australia benefit from the approximate doubling in the real value of additional family payments and their extension to low income working families under this government or the introduction of parenting allowance this year? Of course they do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Self-employed and small business families earning low incomes are eligible for these payments. But you never hear the National Party talking about that. Won't the mothers in regional Australia benefit from the maternity allowance to be introduced next February? Of course they will. Don't families in regional Australia benefit from Medicare? Of course they do. Don't families in regional Australia benefit from expanded child-care assistance; won't they benefit in retirement from expanded superannuation provisions; don't families in regional Australia benefit from expanded education participation? Of course they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I recall some data from my previous portfolio accurately, education participation has increased more rapidly for those from regional Australia. In education, as in employment, a disproportionate&mdash;if anything&mdash;share of benefits have gone to regional Australia. For example, I recall introducing a higher education equity strategy in my previous portfolio, one which explicitly focused on raising participation rates of people from regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to take all these things into account if you are going to talk about living standards. This is as true of non-metropolitan Australia as it is true of metropolitan Australia. Of course most of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's $930 million in this year's budget goes to non-metropolitan Australia. But the National Party never welcomes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this government governs for all Australians. I know that it is a matter of great embarrassment to the National Party that we hold more seats in regional Australia than it holds. The very foundation of the Australian Labor Party straddles both regional Australia, most famously, Barcaldine in Queensland, and metropolitan Australia, particularly Balmain in my own electorate. We remain the largest political party in non-metropolitan Australia. That is because we regard Australia as one nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare this with the opposition, who talk a lot about inequality but whose only policy is wage flexibility&mdash;which we know is code for wage cuts. We know that this means: accept the contract or get the sack. Who does this threaten most? People who have nowhere else to go. Workers in non-metropolitan Australia are the most vulnerable to these policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do recognise that regional Australia has particular needs and particular circumstances. My own department, the Department of Social Security, for example, has a comprehensive access and equity strategy in place to ensure that all Australians who are entitled to social security payments do in fact receive them, regardless of where they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have 216 regional offices of the Department of Social Security around Australia, 66 smaller offices mostly in regional areas, and nearly 400 visiting services, to ensure that people in small towns can access the department. Teleservice centres mean that the department is contactable by telephone from anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call. We have a network of field officers and community agents particularly servicing Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently, of course, we have introduced the drought relief payment. Some 10,400 farm families experiencing exceptional drought circumstances are receiving this payment. It has paid jobsearch allowance rates but does not have an activity test requirement, and the value of the farm asset is exempt from the income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party do not quote the drought relief payment because it is something they would never had the wit or the wisdom to introduce. This is because it is targeted on those most in need: farmers earning no income or, for that matter, making large losses. The National Party has never been in favour of that. Unlike National Party drought policies it is a cash transfer and so does not provide windfall gains to particular people or distort the pattern of rural prices and production. It is an efficient targeted instrument for helping those in most desperate need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $82 million was provided to these farmers last financial year. A further $36 million was provided in the first two months of this financial year. This will continue for as long as it is needed for up to six months after the drought declarations are lifted. It is part of a broader drought strategy, expected to cost some $770 million over four years. This is the sort of thing that we are doing for the people for whom you say we have no concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But government policies for regional Australia do not stop there. In particular, Working Nation allocated $150 million over four years to the regional economic development program. Just to take one example from many, it was this government that provided non-metropolitan Australians with the same choice of television broadcasting channels as exists in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Labor government is interested in developing regional Australia. We are interested in economic development, we are interested in social development and we are interested in ecologically sustainable development. The National Party is interested only in feeding prejudices for the purpose of winning votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just make this point: of course, the premise of this MPI is false.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of these assessments are done on an analyses which are based on the so-called Henderson poverty line, of which Ann Harding, whose paper was quoted the other day, is a strong critic. The fact is that the Henderson poverty line since 1983 has risen 21 per cent in real terms&mdash;that is to say, in excess of the inflation rate. It has not stayed static. Ann Harding, in the paper that was quoted earlier, acknowledges that this has the effect of inflating the numbers in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States they have a poverty line which is indexed to prices; in other words, it stays constant in real terms. In contrast to the United States, which has shown an increase in poverty, with a poverty line increased just to maintain it in real terms, if you do that exercise here under this government, you show a substantial decline of the order of around about 30 per cent in the numbers shown to be in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These poverty statistics and these international statistics have to take account of the different conventions and the different methodologies employed in different countries. On any realistic or reasonable assessment, this government has improved substantially the circumstances of people in this country who are the worst off. This is not just people dependent totally on social security payments; this is low wage work working families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you convert the introduction of additional family payment for low wage working families, which is a measure that this government introduced, taking into account that that is a tax free payment, and consider what the gross wage equivalent of that would be for a family with two children, for example, it is the equivalent of a gross wage increase of $125 a week.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whose words were they? They were the words of Prime Minister Curtin, from his policy speech on 28 August 1940. The Labor Party has forgotten those words because in the 1995 of today many millions of Australians continue to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday was the International Day of Poverty. Of course, that gave us the opportunity in this country to highlight our very real poverty problem right here in our own backyard. The government, and the minister in particular, should hang their heads in shame on their appalling track record in increasing inequality between rich and poor over the last decade. Real wages have fallen in the last 12 years; the cost of a mortgage has increased by 50 per cent; and unemployment remains at a record high, with youth unemployment running at least at 28 per cent&mdash;and, indeed, very much higher in many other specific parts of the country. Prime Minister Hawke in his policy speech in 1987 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by 1990, no Australian child need live in poverty . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What a sick joke to be perpetrated at the expense of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government&mdash;former Prime Ministers, current ministers and current members&mdash;are prepared to say absolutely anything at election time in an endeavour to crawl back into government. It has been estimated that 1.9 million Australians, or 11 per cent of our entire population, are currently in poverty, and 592,000 of them are children aged up to 14 years. Prime Minister Hawke said in 1987 that no child need be in poverty by 1990. Yet here we are in 1995, five years later, and we have almost 600,000 Australian children up to the age of 14 years in poverty. My own home state of Queensland is the most poverty-stricken state in Australia, with 350,000 people living in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note also that coalition members&mdash;members of the Liberal and National parties&mdash;represent the poorest electorates in Australia. My electorate of Fisher is one of the poorest electorates in Australia. The minister has come into this place and has read out a whole set of statistics with a view to mislead us, with a view to persuade us that the situation is other than the reality which we face every day of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than one-quarter of children and elderly people in Queensland live in poverty. Nearly one-quarter of young people under the age of 25 live in poverty. So much for this government which claims that it has been the government of the underprivileged. So much for this government which, in its 13 years in office, has simply masqueraded around as the champion of the underprivileged. What a con! This con will be exposed once and for all at the federal election, whenever it is held. Whether it is held on 9 December, as has been tipped, or whether it is held in February or March next year, the government's failures will be exposed once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government claims to be interested in sole parents, but in Queensland two out of every three sole parents live  below the poverty line. The average weekly disposable income is lower in Queensland than in any other place in the country. The national situation is also appalling. Since Labor came to office, the earning of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners has declined in real terms; yet the earnings of the highest 10 per cent of workers has increased by 17 per cent. We have repeated those figures in this place over and over again. The government has not come up with any satisfactory answer, and people are really seeing through this government as the fraud that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD surveyed some 12 countries and only three countries&mdash;Australia, the US and Canada&mdash;experienced a real decline in the earnings of the least well paid 10 per cent of workers in the last decade. Let us compare the situation here with the situation in the United Kingdom, where people in that group had increases of some 11 per cent. There has been a fall in real household incomes in 70 per cent of neighbourhoods and a real increase in income in only 30 per cent of neighbourhoods in Australia. The minister has the hide to say that things are better. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that things will never get better than they are at the moment. Put in plain English, recent research indicates that average household incomes in the bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods have fallen by more than $7,500 in real terms, while the top five per cent of neighbourhoods have increased their incomes by more than $12,000 on average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister agrees now that the gap between the rich and the poor has widened, but he claims that the recession is over and that we are now in a brave new world. Does the Prime Minister&mdash;the person who likes the French clocks, the person who likes the Italian suits&mdash;have any compassion at all for people on the poverty line struggling to make ends meet; the people Prime Minister Curtin sought to support in 1940? The simple fact is that this government is a government which has lost contact with its origins. It is a government of the quick dollar; a government of the slick deal. It is no longer the government of the underprivileged, and traditional Labor people are deserting this government. In fact, 52 per cent of blue-collar workers have now deserted this government. That is a matter of concern for you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, representing the electorate of Scullin, because 52 per cent of blue-collar workers will not have anything to do with this government&mdash;the government of big business and not the government of the little Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has deserted Labor's traditions of  equality and is adopting the view that the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots does not matter. The Keating government, of course, is wrong. It is most important that we have social cohesion and equality in this country. The coalition, upon election to office, will seek to ensure that the disparities which presently exist are reduced. It is obvious that Australians are not better off under this Labor government. The government always talks about the social wage, but the government's most heralded social wage or so-called safety net is ineffectual for many Aussie battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor the education of children has taken a battering. In 1980, 48 per cent of students from lower income households who completed year 12 went on to higher education, but by 1989 the figure had fallen to 35 per cent. Do not be fooled by the government's false attempts to explain away these grim facts with the comments made by the minister. The government continues to fudge figures in the hope that it will continue to confuse the Australian people. I believe the government will stand condemned at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security claimed that the federal social wage is $1,774 for every Australian and that this has increased by more than $700 since 1983. This figure is arrived at by adding all federal spending on health, education, housing and child care and dividing that by the number in the population. Again, this is another clever play with figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that, with the increase in the Australian population, the minister is misleading the Australian people. The simple fact of the matter is that this so-called federal social wage is not benefiting the people whom the government claims it is benefiting. It is also obvious that 40 per cent of the lowest income earners receive only 35 per cent of the social wage, while 40 per cent of the highest income earners receive 46 per cent of the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation where the government has endeavoured to confuse the Australian people yet again. Don Russell, the current Australian Ambassador to the United States, has said that he wants to come back here to ensure we do not create in Australia the kind of underclass they currently have in the United States. Everyone agrees that the ambassador's comments are totally out of order for a diplomatic representative of Australia, but the simple fact of the matter is that we already have the working poor in Australia. One has to go no further than today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to read about this. It cites the case of someone working on a single wage and actually earning $200 less than he would be earning if he was receiving the dole. That is a matter that should appal every reasonable Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has failed to provide job security. We have heard the statistics about youth unemployment in regional areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia will not be fooled by that any more than they have been fooled by so many other comments of the minister. I believe that, if one looked at the principles that the Labor Party has historically stood for and one looked at the inequality in this nation at the moment, one would see that this Labor Party is no longer the Labor Party of the underprivileged and no longer the Labor Party of the battler. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just talk about the policy sclerosis which struck the Liberal and National parties when in government before 1983.

Not on your nelly. Was it the Labor Party? It was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are some of the industries in the primary sector that have been addressed by the Labor Party? They include the wool industry, the dairy industry, the meat industry, the sugar industry and the horticultural industry&mdash;including fruit, vegetables, vineyards and tobacco, just to name a few&mdash;plus we have created an aquaculture industry. We do not get any credit for that from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a spokesman for the dairy industry on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Morning Australia</EMPHASIS> recently. He said that, whilst a lot of people have gone out of the dairy industry because of the industry's restructuring, its productivity has increased tremendously. I forget the exact figures, but the spokesman said that the industry now has less than half the number of producers, yet they are producing five or 10 per cent more dairy products. Is that a successful policy drive by this government? This industry has become more competitive, by its own admission. Who has achieved this? The Labor government&mdash;not the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Which government had the wit and wisdom to introduce a national landcare program? Was it the coalition when they were in office? No, it was the Labor Party in office. How many Landcare groups are there around Australia currently? There are 2,200 active Landcare groups. How much money per annum is being spent on these Landcare groups, which are supported by primary producers throughout Australia? It is $150 million. Was that an initiative of the coalition when they were in government? Did they seek to reform the way in which people treat the land in this country? Did they look at sustainable economic development in a proper sense? Did they look at micro-economic reform when they were in government? No, they did not. They suffered from the same policy sclerosis that they are suffering from now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of statistics have been bandied around here this afternoon, some of which relate to unemployment. But I want to go to some figures referred to by the member for Fisher. He talked about household disposal income. Let me make it very clear for all to understand: full-time adult average weekly earnings have increased by 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and June 1995; real household disposal income has increased over that same period by 41.8 per cent; and real household disposal income per capita has increased by 20.9 per cent, almost 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting this tirade from the opposition about Australians being worse off as a result of the actions of the Labor government. In fact, they are measurably better off as a result of the deliberate policy determinations made by this government. I will go to some other facts which have implications for what is being said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Fisher, talked about the social wage. Let's make it very clear: the social wage includes expenditure on health, education, housing and child care. Under a coalition government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer, between 1970-78 and 1982-83 the change in the real value of the Commonwealth social wage per person was a reduction of 17.5 per cent. That is, there was a 17.5 per cent fall in the social wage under the previous coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Labor has been in power, since 1982-83, the social wage has gone up by 73 per cent. Yet the opposition still has the gall&mdash;with the National Party supposedly representing regional Australia&mdash;to come in here and expect us to believe the nonsense they are perpetrating, that somehow or other Australians are worse off under Labor. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that the National Party and, indeed, the Liberal Party purport to represent the interests of business. One other area which has been reformed under Labor is the tax system. Let us just have a look at a couple of figures which demonstrate yet again why Australians, wherever they are&mdash;rural, regional or metropolitan Australia&mdash;are measurably better off under Labor than they have ever been, certainly a lot better off than they were under the previous coalition government, and a lot better off than they will ever be under a government administered by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One interesting figure is the amount of money the government spends for its own purposes. Government revenue as a proportion of GDP under the Howard government in 1982-83 was 26 per cent. Under the current government that figure is 25.3 per cent. We are spending less of our income as a proportion of GDP. Government outlays as a percentage of GDP when Mr Howard was the Treasurer were 28.6 per cent. Under this government, this year, they are 25.1 per cent. That is just another example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting issues in relation to the ability of business to get on, to do its job and be competitive, and to families surviving, is income tax. What is the comparison between the rate of income tax under the opposition when it was in power and the rate of income tax now being experienced by Australians wherever they might live? Top marginal tax rates under Mr Howard were 60 per cent. They are now 47 per cent. The bottom marginal tax rate under Mr Howard was 30 per cent. It is now 20 per cent. The company tax rate under Mr Howard was 46 per cent. Under this government it is 36 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What other points of comparison do we need to demonstrate how measurably better off Australians are, wherever they might be, than they were under a Howard coalition. And how much better off are they than they would have been had, God forgive us, the coalition been in government during the 1980s and early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard these arguments about regional economic development.

In June 1994, unemployment in the DEET region of Moree, which is in Gwydir, was 12.9 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In introducing the government's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) really gave the game away when attempting to justify them. This is a government which has made a deal at the expense of students. The government and the universities appear to have agreed that there will be additional places if today's students cough up the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind the House that this government constantly tells us that it is opposed to up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. This is the government that introduced the HECS scheme and has relentlessly boosted the level of HECS. This is the third time the government has proposed to increase the rate of HECS repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, despite the minister's disclaimers in his speech, has winked for a long time at the indisputable fact that Australian undergraduates are being charged up-front fees through the back door. Australian undergraduates are paying for courses not for credit, and when they pass those courses are being credited for them. It is a way of enabling them to get into the system. The government claims that it is unable to establish the validity of these claims. If that is so, then its information sources about the higher education system are very poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no objection to the particular amendments which have been put forward. They were foreshadowed in the second reading speech&mdash;they were not clearly foreshadowed as amendments, I might say&mdash;which introduced the bill. The point was foreshadowed and we do not object to that. What we do object to is the hypocrisy of this government in saying that it is unable to fund these additional places unless the students themselves cough up the money. That is blackmail against today's students. It is totally unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate decides, as I believe it will, to support the coalition's amendments to this legislation, I challenge the minister to make it clear that the government places so little weight on access to the university system that it is prepared to take places away from Victoria and South Australia. If the government does that and decides that it will cut places out of the system, that will not be a result of the decisions of the coalition. It will not be a result of the decisions of the Senate. It will flow directly from the government's own priorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad there are so many members of the government in here to hear me speak about taxation. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which was introduced in this place on 29 June of this year, makes a range of amendments including changes affecting foreign controlled companies; changes affecting dividends paid out of capital accounts, which were announced in this year's budget; extending the accelerated depreciation of ships to 30 June 2002; a number of changes to the collection of tax; reducing the twice monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million as announced in this year's budget; increasing the infrastructure borrowings rebate to 36 per cent in line with the company tax rate; and changes to the superannuation guarantee system allowing employees to elect that employers do not make superannuation guarantee contributions and by allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate superannuation contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three aspects of this bill in particular which I wish to address today. The first one relates to the part of the bill dealing with foreign income and in particular with tainted income. The Australian controllers of a controlled foreign company are not taxed on that part of the controlled foreign company's tainted income&mdash;that is, income including passive and certain other business income which is less than five per cent of its total income which passes the active income test. The commissioner may make adjustments reflecting arms-length values when determining a controlled foreign company's attributable income but it has not been clear whether the adjustment affects the active income test. A lack of power to make adjustment to amounts used in determining the active income test may result in a CFC satisfying the test where it should have failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to clarify that where CFCs have entered non-arms-length transactions with related parties the commissioner is allowed to make adjustments reflecting arms-length values to determine whether a CFC has passed the active income test. Aspects of this particular part of the bill have been raised with the opposition, in particular by the Corporate Tax Association. We are aware from comments made through the Corporate Tax Association that there is more than one company group adversely affected and the legislation would have produced inequitable tax consequences if it had been enacted in the form of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern is the aspect that the application of the amendment incorporated in the bill is to apply for statutory accounting periods ending after 30 June 1995. For a CFC with a statutory accounting period ending after that date, the amendment is therefore applicable as from the beginning of that particular statutory accounting period and therefore has retrospective application. I understand an amendment will be moved in relation to that matter and the opposition will be supporting that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the bill that I wish to turn to relates to dividends paid out of capital accounts. The current position is that all dividends received by resident public companies from resident companies and franked or grouped company dividends received by resident private companies from resident companies are free from tax as a result of the intercorporate dividend rebate. Certain distributions debited to a company's share capital or share premium account or asset revaluation reserve are characterised as dividends. The result is that these distributions qualify for the rebate and effectively give tax redistributions to corporate shareholders and pass on franking credits to shareholders ordinarily unable to access them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill disqualifies dividends that are debited or paid from amounts transferred from, first, share capital accounts, secondly, share premium accounts or, thirdly, asset revaluation reserves from being rebatable or frankable dividends. Share premium accounts include share premium accounts tainted by the inclusion of amounts other than share premiums or amounts which cannot be identified as share premiums in the company's books and which do not therefore satisfy the section 6 definition of `share premium account'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the introduction of the new measures, most of the rebatable dividend adjustment provisions in the legislation have become redundant and are being repealed. The amendments will apply to dividends paid after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995 unless they were declared prior to that time. Dividends from amounts transferred before 9 May from a share capital or share premium account or asset revaluation reserve are not subject to the amendments nor are dividends paid under certain transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures may have, we believe, some unintended consequences and the Insurance Council, in particular, has argued that the legislation could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from the ordinary retained earnings where movements occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves as part of their ordinary business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the government is proposing certain amendments in relation to this provision in particular. What the Insurance Council pointed out is that there is a serious technical deficiency in the current drafting of part of the bill in so far as it relates to rebatable and frankable dividends. The council believes that the legislation, as currently drafted prior to any amendment by the government, could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from ordinary retained earnings where movements occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves as part of their ordinary business activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of this legislation, if enacted in the form that has been presented, could be disastrous for many Australian companies and the anomaly is clearly something&mdash;which the Insurance Council, in particular, believes and we would concur with it&mdash;that was never intended at the time the proposals were announced in the federal budget on 9 May. I will not take the time of the House to go into the technical detail that has been raised by the Insurance Council of Australia, as I understand this is the subject of the amendments which will be moved in the committee stage on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area which I wish to address in relation to this somewhat technical legislation relates to the notional earnings base of the superannuation guarantee charge. Currently, employers can use their pre-21 August 1991 employee earnings base if they continue to contribute to the same fund and under the same law award arrangement or schemes as for an employee for whom they were contributing immediately before 21 August 1991. If they restructure, they generally will have to contribute under the ordinary time earnings base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to extend the use of pre-21 August 1991 employee earnings bases if employers restructure their superannuation funds. An employer will be allowed to keep pre-21 August 1991 earnings bases if the employer contributes under the same law award arrangement or scheme to, first, a new fund under the same earnings base as the original fund if employees transfer between the funds and receive substantially the same or improved rights to benefits; secondly, an existing fund in relation to an employee of a former employer who transfers to the fund from the former employer's fund because of a business acquisition if the base was used in the former employer's fund; or, thirdly, a former employers fund for employees who transfer to the new employer because of a business acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments affect the calculation of the superannuation guarantee charge from 1 July 1995 where qualifying restructures occur after 28 June 1994. The effect is that employers reorganising funds after the announcement need not lose an existing employee earnings base for contributions made for contribution periods after 1 July 1995. Employers who restructured after the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 28 June 1994, which was when this measure was announced, but before 1 July 1995 will have changed to the ordinary time earnings base from the time of restructure. On 1 July 1995 they will be able to revert to the pre-21 August 1991 earnings base to which they previously contributed. The amendment affects an employer's contributions only from 1 July 1995 so that contributions already made by employers during 1994-95 and contributions due for that year will not be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has raised a particular concern in relation to the notional earnings base. ASFA believes that the changes should be effective from the commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and should cover all employer and/or fund reconstructions irrespective of the date of those reconstructions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem which ASFA points to refers to the definition of earnings base in the superannuation guarantee legislation in circumstances where there has been a reconstruction. Paragraph 3.3 of the Treasurer's discussion paper, issued on 4 December 1991, stated that the earnings base for superannuation guarantee contributions would be that set out in the governing rules of the scheme or in an award, provided that, firstly, the scheme was in existence on 20 August 1991 or, secondly, the scheme was not in existence on 20 August 1991 but is a successor to a scheme that was in existence on 20 August 1991 and the earnings base used is no narrower than that used by the original scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the superannuation guarantee legislation was enacted in 1992 no provision was made for these successor funds circumstances. The current bill seeks to address this situation, but only from 1 January 1995. I should indicate that in their representations ASFA is not seeking the retrospective operation of the amendments in order to allow employers to claim refunds from funds. If considered necessary, a provision to prescribe such claims could be included in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question in relation to this particular matter&mdash;the notional earnings base as it relates to the superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;is one which has been effectively raised: why shouldn't the changes be effective from the commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act and cover all employer and/or fund reconstructions, irrespective of the date of those reconstructions? I hope that when the Treasurer or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) come to speak again in this particular debate they could give some indication to the House and to the coalition regarding that particular matter because it does seem to be an anomaly in the way in which the provisions of this bill have been drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from those matters, there are a number of other technical and mechanical aspects of this bill which I will not detain the time of the House this evening by going into in great detail, but those three matters are matters on which the opposition, whilst it does not oppose the legislation, would seek some clarification. In relation to the first matter that I mentioned, we will be supporting an amendment to change the actual date which is set out in the bill itself. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I have come to learn in the time I have been here is how complex and big our tax act is. It covers some 5,000 pages at last count. In my first few months here, after I was appointed to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, at the tail end of the taxation inquiry, I learnt that the taxation law was very complex. People around the room in that PAC inquiry all agreed that something had to be done. I know now that there is a lot of work being done in the Australian Taxation Office on simplifying the tax act. In the meantime, we have to deal with the current situation and we have a number of these amendments which seem to come before the House and the Senate every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation law is a bit like social security  provisions&mdash;the more you get into it and the more you look at different provisions, the more complex it seems. It does not matter what governments try to do, there always seems to be a complication and anomaly that can throw up an injustice, like something that will affect somebody differently from somebody else. We never seem to be able to get the balance quite right in terms of fairness and equity on the one hand and simplicity on the other hand without affecting somebody somewhere along the line. I know that there is a lot of work going on and there is a project called the taxation law improvement project under way at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it was partly because of the desire for simplicity&mdash;at least that was one of the attractions&mdash;that the opposition decided to promote a consumption tax, a goods and services tax, before the last election. One of the arguments in favour of the consumption tax was that it was simpler and everyone would pay the same amount of 15 per cent on all goods and services, except food. That was supposed to be simpler and therefore easier to collect. That was one of the great attractions put forward for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though I do not agree with a consumption tax and never have, there are a lot of people, including some in the tax office, who argue quite genuinely that they believe that that is an attraction of a consumption tax and that we will eventually have one. I hope we never do because I believe it is an inequitable tax and a regressive tax. I do know that some of my friends and people in the community genuinely believe that, because of this supposed simplicity and equality&mdash;although it is not really, of course&mdash;with everyone paying the same flat right of consumption tax, it is therefore simpler and more easy to administer and harder to avoid. I do not happen to believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it has been pointed out that even a GST is not foolproof or avoidance proof and there could still be a black economy associated with a consumption tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already said that there is a need for simplification, but tax is also a very emotional issue. Unfortunately, in this country it seems to be fashionable to talk about reducing tax. We are, as we quite often hear, the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. We were the lowest taxed country; I believe Turkey is now apparently lower taxed than we are, because of some fiddling of the figures or whatever. So now we are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. Unfortunately, some people in the government seem to think that is a badge of honour and we should boast about that. I believe that it is a bit of a problem and people in the community are increasingly seeing it, if they are honest, as a problem because the revenue is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People do expect a certain level of service and quality of services from governments at all levels. If we are going to have that service, people do have to face up to the situation that people have to pay tax and the revenue has to be there. It has to be fair and equitable, of course. But to suggest that we pay too much tax, as a lot of people do, particularly on the other side of the House and in the business community, et cetera, is not only dishonest but unfair and damaging to the Australian economy and the fabric of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, because of the `greed is good' mentality, particularly of the opposition, we have this situation where expectations are raised. Any suggestion that we pay more tax or that individuals pay more tax is treated with horror and we have all sorts of people running for cover, saying, `We are a lower taxing party than you are,' et cetera. I believe that is an undesirable feature of current Australian politics. We really do need to face up to the fact that people have to pay tax and they should pay the tax that is due. That does not mean that ordinary workers&mdash;PAYE taxpayers&mdash;should necessarily pay more tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems is compliance and the avoidance industry, where companies or people on better incomes are able to minimise tax through all sorts of clever accountants and tax minimisation schemes. Of course, one obvious one that I have come across in the last few weeks is the move away from PAYE towards the PPS scheme. We have a number of examples, particularly in the construction industry, where workers are forming themselves into companies or becoming contractors and, therefore, somehow or other qualifying to be PPS taxpayers rather than PAYE taxpayers. That is totally against the spirit of taxation laws, and I understand that that is being looked at by the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot come too soon as far as I am concerned. Not only is this an organised attempt to supposedly bring more flexibility into industrial relations, thereby basically smashing industrial relations and smashing trade unionism by everyone becoming a contractor&mdash;which would suit the opposition's industrial relations policies perfectly&mdash;but also this is potentially eroding the revenue in a big way. That is one area that I will certainly be keeping an eye on in terms of tax policy to make sure that that does not continue and that people do as they are supposed to do&mdash;pay the tax that they are obliged to pay under the PAYE system, whether or not they want to call themselves contractors or subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked to a few friends recently, including people that I know in the taxation area, about the idea of making the tax system simpler. Most PAYE taxpayers probably get a small refund every year. They get their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> every year, and hopefully the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> is correct and they can get around all the supposed errors in it. It used to be called Form S. It possibly still is called that. I have not done my tax this year yet. I should not admit that, should I? I have only about two weeks to go. The ordinary battlers, the PAYE taxpayers who earn an ordinary income, fill in their tax forms and they might get a small refund&mdash;somewhere between $100 or up to $1,000 a year, if they are lucky. It seems to me that the tax system is administered in a rather expensive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good idea might be to bring about, on a properly costed basis, a situation where ordinary taxpayers who earn only wages&mdash;who do not have other complications which preclude them from filling in a Form S, for example&mdash;be given the option of not bothering with a taxation return. By perhaps ticking a box at the beginning of the year on, say, their employment declaration certificate, they might opt out of the taxation system, in the sense that they would not have to bother with a taxation return, and in return they might get $500 or $1,000, whatever is a reasonable rate. I have not costed this, so I do not know. </PARA>

Of course, you could always opt back into the tax system if you thought you could get more of a refund from filling in the form. But, if they are just average taxpayers who might get a few hundred dollars a year, they could opt out of the system and get more in their pay packets, which would add up to the same amount&mdash;an averaged out amount every year&mdash;and they would not have to bother with the form. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not necessarily need to raise tax levels in this country, if only we could get everyone to pay the tax that they should be paying. That has been the major problem. It was exemplified in the late 1970s when the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), was Treasurer. We had the famous bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, and a lot of pressure was put on the then government to do something about that when it became public knowledge. </PARA>

We are still seeing the effects of that in the 1990s with some of the internal Liberal Party politics in Western Australia, which are an echo of the bad days of the seventies and eighties. I lived in Western Australia in the 1970s, and I can recall the Liberal Party slogans and stickers that used to be put up at election times by the Liberal Party that `taxation is theft'. Obviously, the people who run the Liberal Party in Western Australia, the ones who have got the numbers over there, do not think that anyone should pay tax or that it should be voluntary rather than a responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes existed in the 1980s, and this government, from 1983 onwards, had to try to plug the hole in the tax system by bringing in various measures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have problems also in the Senate with taxation issues. It is very difficult when neither party has a majority in the Senate to get agreement on some of these complex areas. That is understandable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be equity and honesty in taxation. There should be an equitable progressive taxation system whereby those who can afford to pay tax most pay the most and there should be relative relief for those on the lower end of the income scale. Our taxation system largely attempts to do that, although perhaps it does not always get it perfectly right. But, as I have said a number of times, it is a very complex system, and we will always find somebody who will say that they are disadvantaged. I guess that's life. The social security system is similar in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has made it difficult is this `greed is good' mentality. The same thing happens in other countries. The conservative parties&mdash;the opposition in Australia&mdash;build up this expectation that we are all paying too much tax, and that makes it very difficult for governments to be responsible in taxation and, at the same time, have policies that ensure their re-election. I agree that at election times people do get a bit carried away with promises and expectations. But what has made it very difficult in this climate which has been created, particularly on the other side of the House, is the suggestion made to people&mdash;and suggesting it often enough so that people believe it&mdash;that as a community we are somehow paying too much tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not paying too much tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) was introduced into the House on 29 June this year. It makes nine substantive amendments to our tax laws. The provisions set out to amend several principal acts, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and Bankruptcy Act 1966. The changes in the bill include those affecting controlled foreign companies; dividends paid out of capital accounts, as announced in the 1995 budget; and extending the accelerated depreciation of ships to 30 June 2002.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, changes are proposed to the method of collecting tax, reducing the price monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million, as announced in the budget, and increasing the infrastructure borrowings rebate to 36 per cent in line with the company tax rate. There are also changes to the super guarantee charge system in regard to allowing employees to elect that members not make SGC contributions under certain circumstances and by allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate SGC contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to rebatable and frankable dividends, this bill proposes to amend the income tax laws so that dividends that are debited to share capital, premium accounts or revaluation reserves of a company are disqualified from being rebatable or frankable. The reason the government is taking this kind of action is apparently to stop companies providing tax free distributions to corporate shareholders or transferring franking credits to shareholders by inappropriate means. This particular measure is therefore aimed at limiting any potential tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only problem is that there is ample evidence that the government is yet again trying to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. There are unintended consequences of the proposal before us which impact on ordinary commercial transactions that are totally lawful. The Insurance Council has had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the legislation, as currently drafted, could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from ordinary retained earnings, where movements have occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves, as part of their ordinary business.</PARA>
<PARA>The council went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of this legislation, if enacted, could be disastrous for many Australian companies, and the anomaly is clearly something that was never intended at the time the proposals were announced in the federal budget . . . Because the effect of the provisions is to deny a company the ability to frank its dividends, the impact of the deficiency&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, I think, the deficiency in the bill's wording&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">could extend beyond Australia's corporate sector to many thousands of individual and institutional shareholders, in receipt of dividends which a company was unaware could not be franked.</PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance Council has provided an example to illustrate this anomaly. Where a company owns a building at 30 June 1994 which cost, say, $100,000 to purchase but is now valued at $150,000, the amount to be credited to the revaluation reserve is quite obviously $50,000. There is also a corresponding debit to the asset account. However, by 30 June 1995, where the value of the building has fallen to $100,000 the company will debit the asset revaluation reserve and credit the asset account with the amount of $50,000. This entails a transfer of an amount from a `disqualifying account', the asset revaluation reserve account, to a `non-disqualifying account', the asset account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 461 of this bill, as part of the write-down, the company will credit the $50,000 I have mentioned in the example to the notional disqualifying account. If no other events occur, and the company pays a dividend of, say, $200,000 in July 1995, with the full amount being debited to its retained earnings, section 46G(1), as currently drafted, will provide that $50,000 of the dividend so paid will not be rebatable and will not be capable of being franked. Mr John Hodgkinson of the Insurance Council, in describing that particular situation, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This situation will not be unusual and is likely to impact on many companies who have amounts moving into and out of asset revaluation reserves, for perfectly legitimate commercial reasons, e.g. complying with accounting standards.</PARA>
<PARA>He has also made the observation that there is nothing to connect the asset revaluation reserve movements with the payment of a dividend. It is totally ridiculous for a company to be placed in the position of paying a dividend in a proper manner but then finding that dividend cannot be franked or rebated to recipient shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia also raises the concern that this legislation will impede legitimate corporate reconstructions. Where this takes the form of the insertion of a holding company between the shareholders and an existing company, companies should not be hindered in undertaking legitimate corporate reorganisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unintended consequences of this bill should be addressed. I have been informed that the government has prepared some amendments&mdash;and they came to hand late this morning&mdash;to address the concerns of the Tax Institute and the Insurance Council. I got them this morning at a quarter past nine. The bill was scheduled to be debated at 10 o'clock. I did not have an explanatory memorandum for those amendments, which go to 2 1/4 pages. Again, this is an example of the disdain with which the parliament is treated when it considers complex legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the changes affecting the tainted income of controlled foreign companies&mdash;CFCs&mdash;there is a retrospective element. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will clarify that the Commissioner of Taxation may make adjustments, reflecting arm's length values to amounts used in determining whether a CFC has passed the income test.</PARA>
<PARA>Without wanting to go into great depth now, because I will do so later in the detailed stages, the problem here is that this amendment will be applied retrospectively for the accounting periods commencing before but ending after June 1995. Therefore this measure is applicable from 1 July 1995 and as a consequence it will in some cases have a retrospective impact on the attributable income of CFCs where their financial year does not conveniently end on 30 June 1995. That is not uncommon, although it is not right either. That is most inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have constantly made the point that retrospectivity as a rule should be avoided in any legislation and in particular in tax legislation. Retrospectivity is only acceptable to me when it does not create losers but, even then, it should still be avoided. Retrospective tax legislation by this Labor government is far from unusual, as I am sure the House is aware. It has been a tool of Labor and it has not hesitated to use it. However, it is clear that such retrospectivity undermines certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the constant stream of tax amendment bills coming before this place, as well as the draft rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, it is obvious that the taxpaying community does not need the added uncertainty of retrospective tax changes. There must be community confidence in the certainty of the law&mdash;certainty that today's legal act does not tomorrow become the trigger for a penalty or obligation by law created subsequent to that legal act and applied retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With tax law, taxpayers need to be able to determine their obligations with at least a modicum of certainty. But with retrospective tax legislation not only must taxpayers assess their tax position according to current law but also they need to determine what the intent of the relevant law was at the time it was drafted and passed through the parliament. That is necessary because one day the legislation will be retrospectively amended along certain lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that we expect too much from taxpayers and accountants. How can taxpayers be expected to pre-empt what was the real intent of the law with their scarce resources, when parliament and its supporting bureaucracy couldn't get it right in the first place? The parliament, and especially the government, should be accountable for their errors, not taxpayers. Retrospectivity is a denial of natural justice and a repudiation of fairness where it occurs in our tax system. Not only is the tax system almost unintelligible, compliance costs exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime, but also with retrospectivity there is a serious element of guesswork, in trying to get an understanding of tax law. Stability and certainty in the tax system are key concepts this government simply has not been able to grasp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill comes before the House just over 10 years since the government announced its reform of the Australian tax system&mdash;otherwise aptly known as RATS. This announcement followed the much heralded 1985 tax summit, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, where the much supported option C of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was rejected by Bob Hawke in a deal with the ACTU heavies. RATS was supposed to provide a tax system which is simpler, fairer, does not increase the overall tax burden, does not disadvantage welfare recipients, moderates wage pressures, does not stifle investment, growth and jobs, and has widespread community support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key aspects of Labor's changes included the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and dividend imputation. Labor might postulate that it has succeeded in meeting its objectives, and quite often it does. However, the reality is they have failed dismally. The overall tax burden has increased. Taken as a percentage of gross domestic product, public sector revenues have increased from 33.4 per cent to 34.4 per cent. Of this, the federal component appears to have fallen, but only because grants to the states have been slashed. Then, of course, when compulsory superannuation is added&mdash;because, let us face it, it is a tax on earnings&mdash;the overall tax burden has increased. Mr George Megalogenis put it accurately in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 19 September 1995 when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total tax burden on workers is greater now than it was 10 years ago today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are also paying more in indirect taxes than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax plan . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How is that? Australians are now also paying more in indirect taxes than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax plan. Well, we know Labor always rants about the reduction of the top marginal rate from 60 per cent to 49 per cent, yet Labor still collects more income tax in real terms than the Fraser government ever did. Why is that? Bracket creep is the answer, as it always has been. Many middle income earners are now in the highest tax bracket. Labor's cuts to the marginal tax rates were removed by stealth, as you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-tax avoidance and evasion measures have been taken to ludicrous degrees, when the most simple method of limiting avoidance is, and always was, a goods and services tax. A goods and services tax would force many tax dodgers to start declaring their real level of income, thereby allowing the government to get off the back of honest taxpayers. Labor's tax system is definitely not simpler, and it is in no way fairer. Shifting huge wads of the cost of compliance on to employers may be electorally clever but economically it is disastrous. As a partial consequence, the objective of not stifling investment, growth and jobs has been a farcical failure. </PARA>

However, the introduction of a GST would be a bonus to those on welfare because it would better provide an environment for them to get out of the welfare poverty trap in so many cases. To put it lightly, this government has totally failed to grasp the real reforms needed to provide a simpler, fairer and more equitable tax system. Of Labor's 10 years of so-called tax reform, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 15 September 1995 had this to say in an editorial:</PARA></TALK.START>

I can think of other depressing things around this parliament, such as the salad bar in the members' dining room and the answers that we are sometimes forced to listen to at question time from some of the more narcotically boring members of the government front bench. There are certainly many other equally maudlin prospects but a tax bill is probably about the worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tax system is embodied in the monstrous Income Tax Assessment Act, the first volume of which I have with me this afternoon. It is really now not so much a matter of a grimace of horror but a matter of black humour. It has become so complex and so far beyond the comprehension of ordinary Australians, be they individuals striving to earn an income in some field or workers for a large corporation, that resort to expensive and certainly very well qualified advisers is really the only answer these days if you have a problem with the tax office. I believe it is really so complex that perhaps we could say that the tax act itself is one of the chief causes of this country's economic woes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the tax office towards this complexity is quite clear: they love it. There is nothing a tax bureaucrat likes more than a good dose of complexity. This was revealed in a startlingly topical article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, which contained some comments made by a senior Treasury official, the head of the federal Treasury's tax policy division. He may not be from the Australian Taxation Office, but he certainly fits the description of a tax bureaucrat. Mr Ken Henry, in defending the complexity of the tax legislation, said, `Well, that was what was needed to deal with a complex world.' They have no sympathy whatsoever for the ordinary citizen who suffers the burden of this act and the general taxation scheme&mdash;whether it be income tax, fringe benefits tax or sales tax. I believe that the complexity of the scheme keeps those bureaucrats safe in their positions of power and authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Henry said `bad luck' when people complained to him about the complexity of the act, then it is quite clear that there is no sign of a move towards a simpler system under this government. There does not even seem to be any sympathy for the prospect of a simpler system. When we debated the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill last month, I pointed out that, in seeking to reduce the cost of compliance and the burden on the public, we are actually adding another 60 pages to the legislation. That legislation was 342 pages long when I was born in 1961. It now exceeds 5,000 pages. Enough said about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer back to Mr Henry's comment that, as life is complex, we have to have a complex tax system. During the debate on the cost of compliance bill, I proposed that, as technology changes and the nature and incidence of employment and earnings grow more complicated as the years pass, the revenue raising means of a government will have to adapt to these changes. The government is choosing a most mechanical and intrusive approach and is enacting highly technical legislation. In the case of the compliance bill, the legislation imposed a liability on the employer. This will necessarily fetter or restrict an employer's or an individual's ability to produce earnings or a return on the capital that they may invest. The employment opportunities and further investment prospects are likewise restricted. That is the true meaning of the cost of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of compliance of any tax system or any part of a tax system goes beyond the monetary penalty and the opportunity cost to the existing taxpayers. Every legislative act or administrative act of government has an effect on the psychology of investment. I describe it simply as the atmospheric effect. Consideration has been given to the atmospheric effect caused by our tax system in a report by a group called the APEC Capital Markets Working Group, whom a newspaper article describes as `a group of business and financial market leaders who will lobby the Australian government to strengthen efforts for Australia to become a major financial centre in this region'. It is something that you hear quite a lot about in the government's rhetoric. This group of business and financial market leaders wrote a report which they presumably gave to the government. They pointed out quite clearly that Australia's tax system has a number of competitive disadvantages, including an international reputation for being unsympathetic to regional headquarters, and is considered to be a significant disincentive. There is really no point in saying anything further after hearing those comments from that group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to consider the position of the taxpayer&mdash;whether it be a corporate taxpayer or an individual&mdash;and how that person is treated by the tax office. Only yesterday I had a telephone call in my office from a constituent who was having his first tax audit. It sounded as though he was about to have his first child or his first dip in the sea at Bondi Beach. He was a little bit nervous about how the tax office was going to treat him, and he probably had good reason to be nervous about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> published an article by a former officer of the tax department, Mr Douglas. Mr Douglas is a lawyer who now practises as a partner with one of Sydney's larger law firms. He pointed out that, during his time in the tax office, the culture had changed as a result of some rather radical administrative changes. He said that they did not report in a horizontal fashion. The compliance officers, the lawyers within the tax office, are the doves. The hawks are the accountants, the bean counters, who in a rapacious fashion are out to squeeze every last cent from the taxpayer. The lawyers within the tax office take a more measured approach that emphasises the rights of the taxpayers. In the past, the compliance people had their own little section. The other section of the tax office, which dealt with individuals, large corporations, small corporations, rural producers and any other special working groups, would go to see the compliance group&mdash;that is, the lawyers&mdash;to check their work as they were carrying out audits. In that sense, there was a nice system of checks and balances on them. This was described as the horizontal style of organisation. For some reason, this was changed to a vertical system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office was reorganised so that each section which dealt with large corporations, small corporations, individuals and so forth had their own little in-house compliance officer or officers. They were much smaller in number. This meant that the burden on them to check the work of the hawks, the people carrying out the audits, was so great that they began, through no fault of their own, to fail in their task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Douglas also told me that working in the same physical environment with the compliance officers over in the corner of the office made them feel somehow intimidated when making decisions or giving advice that was adverse to the interests of the hawks. If one of the audit officers came up with a proposal to issue a draft ruling that would be adverse to the interests of the taxpayer and he was very keen to do this, the compliance officer with whom he might go out and have a beer on Friday or with whom he might socialise&mdash;like any other Australian office, people who work together occasionally spend time together outside work&mdash;might feel a little less inclined to perform his duties in a strict fashion. He may say to the audit officer, `Look, I think you're going a bit far with your proposed draft ruling.' He would go soft on it. In that sense, the hawks were getting their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason given for this change in the culture of the tax office was enormous pressure on the tax office's revenue raising activity. That is clearly driven by a very loose fiscal discipline here in Canberra. From the top down, enormous pressure is placed on the tax office to raise as much revenue as possible with no regard to fairness. This reorganisation has given ascendancy to the hawks within the office. There is much to be done after the next election in reforming the way the tax office behaves when it deals with our citizens. No doubt after the election the government of this nation will change and a more sensible approach to this monstrous piece of legislation and its administrative underpinnings will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 before us this afternoon, I would like to make a few remarks about the provisions regarding the pay-as-you-earn tax system and the peculiar proposal for a system of tax vouchers, which is really a cloak for a system of granting the tax office free loans. I would like to also speak about some provisions to do with the superannuation guarantee levy and reiterate a few other things about the absurdity of the tax act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the PAYE tax system, it seems as though this amendment is just another burden imposed on small and medium businesses. The existing law, as I understand it, says that companies which remit pay-as-you-earn tax deductions of under $5 million per month are obliged to remit them once a month. So the cost to their business of making the calculations and the bank charges that they will pay on that occur once a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly, this threshold is to be reduced to $1 million. This will of course require many more companies to send in that money twice a month. For some of them, it will go close to nearly doubling the cost of performing that transaction. Again, the explanatory memorandum gives the reason for this. It is all because the government needs another $275 million in the 1995-96 year of income. There you have it&mdash;the loose fiscal discipline in Canberra working again to cause a bigger burden on the poor old innocent taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of this grab for more money in this climate are serious. They really should not be underestimated because the prospects for next year, despite the rhetoric from the government frontbench&mdash;we have grown used to it and we take little notice of it these days&mdash;are looking rather grim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House that the ABS has a relatively new indicator. It is called the composite leading indicator. It is composed of eight different indicators: economic statistics, which have some element of predictive capacity to them, and others that have great bearing on the prospects for Australia's real GDP movements&mdash;things like housing finance, the changes in the United States' real GDP and of course real interest rates, which are inverted in the calculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS put this together and then recalculated the figures going back to 1971. They do it quarterly. The significant thing is that in the June quarter of this year the index suffered its greatest quarterly fall since the June quarter of 1974. For the June quarter of 1995 this composite leading indicator suddenly falls off a cliff, as it does for 1974. If this indicator is a reliable guide to future movements in our own GDP&mdash;in the next, say, four quarters&mdash;we can say that it is not unreasonable to expect that our real GDP in the second or third quarter next year may be close to even negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the rhetoric, if this leading indicator has the predictive capacity that the ABS claims it does&mdash;they are a reasonably conservative lot when it comes to describing the power of their statistics&mdash;and the indicator has really fallen as much as or a little more than it did in 1974, I would need to be convinced that we are not going to have negative growth about this time next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow morning we have an opportunity to ask questions of the Governor of the Reserve Bank when he makes an appearance before the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration of this House. I look forward to taking the opportunity to ask him what he thinks is the significance of this sudden fall off a cliff. If you look at the elements within it individually, you will see that the movement in real interest rates caused by the bank's hiking of the official discount rate about this time last year has made a large contribution to that. But, generally speaking, I would just like the question answered. </PARA>

The worst type of management a nation can have is one which borrows to fund its debt. There is only one place where that finishes up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian debt currently stands at over $180 billion. This is about an eightfold increase since 1983 when the debt was $23 billion. That is the record of the current government. Our total debt-foreign liabilities, which is the debt plus foreign equity in Australian companies, stands at about $260 billion&mdash;five times the level of 1985. This is what this Australian government has done to this great nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account crisis, the deficit we have, for 1994-95 was $26.8 billion&mdash;the highest annual deficit that Australia has ever run. I do not know how this year is going to finish. The government, with an election on its hands, is likely to blow its predictions right out of the water. Any talk of the country being in surplus next year or the year after is crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ratio of our gross domestic product to our current account deficit, as calculated by the OECD, is a lot worse than Mexico. In 1994 we were about equivalent to Mexico. This year Mexico is way ahead of us. We are just really at the bottom of the list. These are the OECD figures. This is the ratio of our foreign debt to the proportion of our GDP. That is a reasonable relationship to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standard and Poor's international currency agency rates Australia 49th out of the 51 countries it surveyed in terms of current account deficit&mdash;49th out of 51! No wonder Mr Murdoch had some comments to make about your Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his descriptions of Australia's success. Mr Murdoch does understand what the real needs of Australia are. He does understand the levels of youth employment. The Prime Minister says, `One of the reasons we've got high youth unemployment is Mr Murdoch is not getting involved in our make-work programs where the taxpayer funds a company to take on employees.' That is not a solution which is a workable solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been left behind by many other countries in addressing its deficit. There is the deficit blow-out to 6.6 per cent of GDP. Comparable deficits were recorded by Finland, UK and Canada in 1989. We were at about the same level of deficit as a proportion of GDP as Finland, UK and Canada. In 1995 the OECD projects that these nations will be able to get on top of their current account deficits. The projections are: Finland, a current account surplus of 1.8 per cent; United Kingdom, a deficit of 0.1 per cent; and Canada, a deficit of 2.2 per cent. All of these performances are far better than Australia's. But the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister fail to acknowledge any of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had discussions over the last week or so about whether or not local interest rates are affected by the foreign debt. Of course they are. The Prime Minister&mdash;despite all his shoving, skating and weaving&mdash;finally had to acknowledge that internal interest rates are affected by our foreign debt. Australia has the equal highest prime rate for corporate in the advanced industrial world. Australia's short-term three-month interest rate is exceeded only by Italy, Spain and Sweden&mdash;all countries that are running a higher deficit regime than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, is from the left side of his party. He has a compassionate heart and has a real wish to see those in need, the battlers of Australia, taken care of and supported. He would not be supporting the ripping down of homes in the Sydenham area by the federal government to make way for airlines. He would not be supporting the processes of battlers being out of work. He would not be naturally supporting those, but he is bound by his ministerial oath. I understand that. But I would have thought he would be working very hard and encouraging the government to work very hard to reduce the debt so that opportunities to employ in Australia were greatly increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the impact of the debt on interest rates, one just has to quote the budget papers. The 1995-96 budget papers, on page 2.36, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premia on borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>It is there in the budget papers and it has been there all the time. The Treasurer tried to avoid the fact that he knew it was there. In the 1993 report to the government on national savings, Vince Fitzgerald, the government's own employed consultant to look at savings and the direction the government was taking, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is there. We are paying much more for houses, cars and consumables of every sort because of the high interest regime the government has. Large current account deficits place upward pressures on rates. The Prime Minister jacked up interest rates in 1989 to rein in the current account deficit. Mortgage interest rates reached 18 per cent and led to the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess at that time it was of no surprise to Australians to hear the Prime Minister make the claim that an economy which cannot travel at four per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away and that we ought to be able to run this economy at least at four per cent. It is not running at four per cent growth now. It is dropping off. And look at the mess that is still there. When the recovery got under way the Prime Minister still kept interest rates high to stabilise the current account in that way. The Commonwealth has been the prime driver in so many ways of Australia's deteriorating foreign debt. Vince Fitzgerald said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, the foreign debt position of Australia, and for that matter the current deficit, which is dominated by interest payments on the past accumulated debt, are attributable only to a small extent if at all to private sector net borrowing; rather they are essentially attributable to government and, indeed, to a significant extent represent borrowing to finance public consumption rather than investment, at least at the Commonwealth level.</PARA>
<PARA>So what has that done? That has forced Australian borrowers off the Australian market and onto overseas markets. That has been detrimental to the nation as well. It has been the Australian management of it: not only has the debt been created by the government in its own thirst for funds to finance its own consumer programs, but also it has had the double whammy of forcing Australian companies offshore where they have had to borrow and where the government, of course, is paying a higher rate for money that it is borrowing&mdash;which means a higher interest rate the Australian taxpayer at one time will have to return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we are again, debating yet another government tax bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. The 4,000 or so pages in the tax legislation are not enough. We are about to get another great stack of new regulations, new taxes, new burdens on the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that this government just goes on a taxing binge every time the budget is presented to the Australian people. In the last coalition budget&mdash;sadly, far too long ago&mdash;the total tax receipts were $40.7 billion. In the budget presented to us this year from the Labor government they are $124.4 billion. So the Australian taxpayers have lamented each budget as new and more severe tax measures have been imposed upon the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this comes from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who told us in November 1992, `What I am promising is not to put up tax'&mdash;I repeat: what I am promising is not to put up tax. Of course, every budget since then, following on all those prior to that, has massively increased taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current budget individual income tax is up 13.6 per cent; the Medicare levy up 18.4 per cent; company tax up 15.4 per cent; super funds tax up 13.2 per cent; fringe benefits tax, 4.4 per cent, after being up 131 per cent in the previous budget; other income taxes up 8.3 per cent; sales tax up 22.3 per cent; fuel excise, 7.7 per cent&mdash;in fact, fuel excise has increased seven-fold in the life of the Labor government; other excise duties up 8.8 per cent; and customs duties up 3.2 per cent. So the list goes on and on. These enormous increases are really costing Australians dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just business that pays taxes, it is not just rich people that pay taxes; every ordinary Australian pays them every day. A bite of every pension payment, a bite of every disability pension and a bite of every welfare benefit goes to paying taxes&mdash;the government's indirect tax regime. At the last federal election there was so much criticism of the coalition's GST proposals. But it is interesting to note that Labor is now collecting more from the indirect taxes the coalition was going to abolish than the coalition had aimed to collect from its GST. All of that has happened without any of the compensatory measures that the coalition was proposing. There are none of the alternative benefits that were going to be provided and none of the benefits to the national economy. Just on a raw tax basis, Labor is now collecting more from its sales taxes, its fuel excise and the like than the coalition would have collected from the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no doubt about who are the big taxers in Australian history: it is the Labor government. In spite of all of the talk about simplification and tax cuts, the fact is that the burden gets greater each year and the complexity gets greater each year. That is one of the real tragedies of our current tax system. When the Income Tax Assessment Act became law in 1936, it contained just 126 pages. It had grown to 1,328 pages by 1983. So in its first almost 50 years it gained something like 1,200 pages. But in the life of the Labor government the Income Tax Assessment Act has grown close to 4,000 pages. In just 13 years, it has more than trebled in length. In all, Australia now has more than one million words of tax law spread over 7,000 pages. According to figures provided to a Senate estimates committee last year, it now costs more than $1.1 billion just to operate the Australian Taxation Office. That is almost four times what it cost a decade ago. The ATO now pays $213 million a year for leasing and maintaining its offices and is the biggest rent payer in most Australian capitals. At the time of that committee inquiry, the ATO had almost 18,000 permanent staff working in 25 separate offices to collect our tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that cost is basically borne by the victims of the Australian tax system. A recent study by the Australian Tax Research Foundation found that it cost business $123 for every $100 of company tax it pays to the federal government. It will cost companies around $4 billion in hidden calculation and other compliance costs to pay next year's company tax bill. The costs in Australia are almost 11 times higher than those in the United Kingdom. For the majority of companies, the cost of compliance is higher than the amount of corporate tax that they pay. That is an incredible indictment on the current system. It costs most companies more in compliance costs than in actual tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is many taxpayers come out of a tax audit with a very bad taste in their mouths, believing it was simply impossible to comply with existing legislation which has seen the legislative services division of the ATO writing such complex rules which now compel more and more specialist cells to be established in the ATO, because not one tax auditor could possibly understand the maze of legislation that exists.</PARA>
<PARA>The Taxation Office cannot understand the maze of legislation which exists, but the poor, individual taxpayers are expected to. The last <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> was crammed with errors, yet taxpayers who made a mistake were penalised and required to account for every one of their actions. The fact is that the existing law has become unreasonably complex and impossible for ordinary Australians to understand and comply with. It is high time that our tax law was addressed and we looked seriously at simplifying it and achieving an understandable law which people were able to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax is the classic example of this. Most people just give up in despair at the complexity they face when trying to adequately fulfil the requirements of the fringe benefits tax law. It is almost impossible to keep the required documentation, so when the tax office comes along most businesses just ask in despair, `How much do you want?' and, instead of arguing, they pay up and shut up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the way tax law ought to be administered, and it is not the way a responsible government should act. This government continues with its constant binge of tax collection and its constant approach that businesses only exist so they can pay higher and higher taxes to the government and that citizens only earn wages so they can contribute more to the government's coffers so the government can then go on its wild spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that today the government released some kind of a book to chronicle its achievements in government. Frankly, I do not know why they needed a book to do that; a postage stamp would have been absolutely adequate. I have seen a number of books in newsagencies which on the outside cover says, `The complete and unabridged achievements of the Labor government,' but when you open them up you find that every page is blank.

He also thinks this is as good as it gets and it will never get any better. I have to admit that this might be as good as Labor can do and it might be as good as the Prime Minister can do, but it sure ain't good enough for the Australian people. If this is as good as the government can do, it is time they gave it away and let somebody else get on with running the country and achieving worthwhile things for our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of specific matters I would like to address in relation to this legislation. This might seem to be a very small matter, but I think it is one of some significance and importance. Just over a year ago, there was a terrible bus crash in Brisbane which took the lives of a number of my constituents. An inquiry into that bus crash was undertaken&mdash;as has happened with many other similar accidents in Australia over recent years&mdash;and it was recently completed. In almost all of those inquiries&mdash;certainly the inquiry into the crash of the Maryborough bus&mdash;it was stated that lives almost certainly would have been saved if passengers in the bus had been wearing seat belts. In fact, the federal and state governments have agreed to make the fitting of lap-sash seat belts compulsory in all new coaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As new coaches are sales tax free, no sales tax applies to the seats and seat belts fitted to those vehicles. However, there are a small number of existing coaches which can be upgraded to meet the new safety standards with the fitting of new seats and lap sash belts. In cases where the seats and seat belts are retrofitted, incredibly, they attract sales tax at the rate of 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coach operators are not obliged to upgrade their existing vehicles to meet the standards applying to new coaches. They can continue to operate them indefinitely. I am told that the cost of fitting modified seats and lap sash belts to an existing coach is approximately $35,000 per vehicle, a significant amount. The imposition of a 22 per cent sales tax on such an investment is an enormous disincentive for any coach owner to introduce such improved safety measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wide Bay Tours coach that was involved in the accident near Brisbane last year could not have been fitted with these seats. More often than not, the older coaches do not have adequate anchor points. You really need to build these in at the time the coach is constructed. But there are some coaches around, particularly those constructed in recent years, that could have the safer seating fitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should encourage the owners of those vehicles to fit the alternative seating. They should not be discouraged by harsh taxation. You really have to question the government's sincerity in endeavouring to upgrade coach safety when it imposes such a heavy tax penalty on those who voluntarily chose to install Australian Standards seats with lap sash seat belts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first raised this matter with Treasury in November last year. I sent subsequent reminder letters but I still have not been given the courtesy of a reply. Sadly, that is typical of Treasury. It seems to adopt a very arrogant approach to correspondence. It is common&mdash;in fact, it is the norm&mdash;to wait six, nine or 12 months to get a response to submissions put to it. That is disgraceful, and a discourtesy to members of parliament or anyone else who writes to make a constructive suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a big revenue item. I have already mentioned that a lot of coaches are able to be retrofitted with these sorts of seats. Surely, if even one life was saved, there would be massive benefits to our community. If even one accident victim was less severely injured, the cost returns to the nation would be overwhelmingly realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is actually in the chamber on a rare visit, to take this matter on board. I ask him to go back to the letter I wrote to Treasury in November last year, consider it carefully, and make a considered judgment on whether there should be a sales tax concession in these sorts of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While dealing with sales tax matters, I would like to refer to another anomaly. I had the courtesy of a reply from the Assistant Treasurer on a matter I raised with him initially on 20 June 1994. I finally got a reply on 9 March 1995&mdash;about a nine-month turnaround, which is par for the course. Sadly, the answer, when I got it, was no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this particular matter&mdash;another safety matter&mdash;it was drawn to my attention that builders' safety cut-out boxes, which are an important electrical safety item, are subject to sales tax when they are a stand-alone item. If they were included in a product as part of a larger piece of machinery, the identical item would be sales tax free. Again, it seems to me that the general principle should be that matters essential to safety in the workplace&mdash;in many cases, things that are compulsory&mdash;should be sales tax exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's reply in this instance is really quite extraordinary.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He admitted that there was an anomaly and said that there were a couple of ways it could be solved. One would be to exempt all goods of this nature from sales tax&mdash;I thought that was a commendable approach&mdash;but he was worried about the effects on his budget. He does not look at ways in which the government might be prepared to save money; he prefers to place workers' lives at risk by imposing this ever-increasing sales tax on a product which could help save many people from electrical injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He suggested that another way out of this anomaly would be to exempt from tax all products that require the safety cut-out box. That is a perfectly noble suggestion except that the minister completed his letter by saying, `The government does not propose at this stage to change the tax treatment for such items.' He admits it could be done, he admits it is an important safety feature, he admits there is anomaly but he will not do anything about it. Sadly, that is the approach so often taken by the government when anomalies in the current taxation system are drawn to their attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current tax law, for all its complexity and its attempts to stamp out avoidance measures, has become all the more complex and difficult to understand. In the process, every time changes such as those before us tonight are made, a new set of anomalies is created, a new set of distortions is put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be radical reform of the tax system. This government thinks that this is as good as it can get.

It is the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about the complexity of the tax act; you talk about the number of pages. We used to have a simple tax system once&mdash;for the rich, that is. They had a choice of whether they paid it or not. That was when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. That was a simple tax system: `Will I pay tax or will I not? I don't think I will pay tax.' That was a simple system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a real slim tax act back in those days. We did not have many people in the tax office. And look what happened: all of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It was not as if the Treasurer of the day was not warned. The tax office was up there begging him to do something about it, but he would not. That is the sort of tax system the Liberals ran the last time they were in government, and here they are preaching to us about how we should run our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons for the number of pages in the tax act, for it being as voluminous as it is. The simple fact is that we put a lot of decent tax on the books&mdash;things like a capital gains tax and a fringe benefits tax, which the opposition never supported. What about the capital gains tax? Are you going to get rid of it? No. What about the fringe benefits tax? Are you going to get rid of it? No. You are not going to get rid of that one either. You did not support it when we brought it in here, but you have seen over time how decent these taxes are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the only reason you are not getting rid of them is that you cannot afford to. With all of the promises you are going to make in the next election campaign, you actually need the revenue that these taxes bring in. We know that is the real reason you are going to keep them&mdash;not out of any sense of decency. We had that debate, and the member for Curtin was here. He was a member of the Liberal Party then and he voted and spoke against them. He said that the sun would not come up tomorrow if we had a capital gains tax. He did not mention the fact that every other country in the world had one. The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were made possible because we did not have a capital gains tax. You voted against the capital gains tax. And the fringe benefits tax. What a rort! Under the now Leader of the Opposition, if you had the choice why would you take all of your income in cash? You would be a mug. You would pay tax on it. The fringe benefits tax now is a fair tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about compliance costs, and the previous speaker, the member for Wide Bay, spoke about compliance costs. I know a little about the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax because, on behalf of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), I went around and spoke to firms about the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax. We came up with a package, introduced a couple of weeks ago, which slashed the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House&mdash;the member for Menzies was here&mdash;about the shadow Treasurer. This shadow Treasurer is a beauty. He goes down to a tax forum in Old Parliament House&mdash;the old hairy chest, the big speech: `I am going to slash the costs of complying with the fringe benefits tax.' What happens? The next day, I introduce a bill to do just that and what do we get out of him? We got three little amendments, which he did not even move himself. He left it to the member for Menzies to move them. We saw three little amendments, which did nothing more than tinker with ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not kid us about compliance costs. We have seen how good you are. When the shadow Treasurer talks about tax reform, he has nothing up his sleeve but his arm. We know that now because we gave him the opportunity the day after he said he would slash compliance costs. He had nothing. I made the point before: when these people come around and talk to you about slashing compliance costs on the FBT, about cutting taxes or about doing anything with the tax system, do not believe them. They have nothing in the locker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I said at the time we were debating the fringe benefits tax was that in most cases it is a voluntary tax. The government does not force firms to give people cars. The government does not force employers to say to people, `We will give you an around-the-world holiday,' or to pay any of the other expenses like a child's education expenses or private health insurance. We do not tell firms to do that. That is something they do themselves voluntarily. So if they are paying the fringe benefits tax, they are doing it because they choose to. Why do they not just cash it out? They would not be in the fringe benefits tax system any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So do not talk to us about reducing compliance costs or about simplifying the tax system because we know it is all rhetoric.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to the bill. I have had a bit of fun here because I have been responding to some of the most outrageous claims we are getting from the opposition. I thought I would have to put them in their place. The member for Menzies and the Independent member for Curtin complained that the CFC amendments would have a retrospective effect. I remind members that the CFC provisions are anti-avoidance measures. The proposed amendments will simply overcome a weakness that has been exploited by parties seeking to escape accruals taxation on income that should be taxed under the CFC measures. The alternatives to their proposed treatment in the bill is to defer the commencement of the amendments by a year. That would allow all of these activities to flourish for another year and we are not going to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also some debate about the Superannuation Guarantee Act, about the changes that apply for reconstructions after the date of effect; that is, 1 July 1992. I am informed that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia suggests early application of the amendments on the basis that the Treasurer's December 1991 information paper canvassed successor scheme restructuring. Many things are canvassed in papers but subject to submissions, discussion and review. So it was with possible successor scheme rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduced in parliament on 2 April 1992 did not provide for employers to continue to contribute under a pre-1991 earnings base if they changed funds. It provided no successor scheme rule and parliament showed no intention of providing for such a rule in its consideration and passage of the bill which became the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 with effect from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers who restructured their superannuation schemes before 28 June 1994 did so in the knowledge that the law required them to use the standard ordinary time earnings base after the restructure. True, the possibility of a successor fund rule was discussed before the law was made, but the law foreshadowed when it was introduced before the date for which it was to apply included no such rule. Until the Treasurer's statement of 28 June 1994, no employer had any reason to expect to keep a lesser earnings base after restructuring superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers who bought a business or business assets and transferred the associated employees had no reason at all to expect to keep a lesser earnings base on the former employer's use for those employees. Not the December 1991 information paper, the April 1992 bill, or the parliament's consideration of it suggested such a possibility. These amendments led employers to avoid the administrative cost of changing the earnings base for their superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments apply from 1 July 1995 for restructures after the Treasurer announced these changes on 28 June 1994. Restructures before that time have already incurred the cost of changing to the standard base ordinary time earnings and restructures before that time were made with no reasonable expectation of going back to a lesser measure for superannuation contribution. For this reason, these amendments apply only in relation to restructures occurring after the Treasurer's announcement. </PARA>

The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has already alluded to the reason. It involves a matter of retrospectivity. Let me say at the outset I have no objection to the intention of the clause to come to grips with avoidance practices. I made that abundantly clear in my speech on the second reading.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the amendments will clarify that the Commissioner of Taxation may make adjustments, reflecting arm's length values, to amounts used in determining whether a CFC has passed the income test.</PARA>
<PARA>I regret that the Assistant Treasurer, for whatever reason, was not here during my speech on the second reading but I am sure he has got the gist of it from the advisers. The problem is that the government amendment, as it now stands, will be applied retrospectively for accounting periods ending after 30 June this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore axiomatic that part of the relevant tax year to attract this burden occurs before 30 June 1995 and therefore becomes taxable for that part of the tax year prior to 30 June last. Therefore, the measure is applicable from 1 July 1995 and, as a consequence, it will in some cases have a retrospective impact on the attributable income of CFCs. The amendment I am proposing to clause 20 of schedule 1 will ensure that no company which has a statutory accounting period other than one which involves the end of a financial year on 30 June will be affected by the application of the new tainted income rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress that not many companies do not wrap up their tax years or financial years on dates other than 30 June each year. Therefore, there is not much revenue involved in this. It is unquantifiable, I guess, but there is very little involved in this. That just makes it even more important to me that there should be an absence of retrospectivity and there is really no excuse for not treating taxpayers equitably. It is only fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember that it has only limited application. Because it has only limited application, it is not worth breaching a principle of abhorrence of retrospectivity which we should hold if we value certainty under the law. My proposal is only fair because, as the bill now stands, a company has, for example, a statutory accounting period ending on 30 September 1995, the tainted income provisions of this tax amendment bill becoming applicable from 1 October 1994&mdash;that being the beginning of that particular accounting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no need for revenue or other reasons. There is a good case to be made out on equity grounds for accepting this amendment. I just want to finish by saying that presence of retrospective legislation does undermine certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. Retrospectivity is a denial of natural justice, in my view, and a repudiation of fairness in that system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few weeks ago a virus deadly to the Australian feral rabbit population escaped from a fenced off quarantine area four miles off the coast of South Australia on Wardang Island. Apparently, it stayed on the island for some time. This virus&mdash;the rabbit calicivirus&mdash;was being tested by a consortium of the CSIRO, the state DPI and the Animal and Plant Control Commission of South Australia with, I understand, involvement from the New Zealand government, the NFF, the wool board, the Wool Corporation and so forth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The escape raises the possibility that a vector&mdash;perhaps a bush fly or other carrier&mdash;is able to transfer the virus from one area or another with deadly result to the rabbit. Up till now scientists have only thought that the infection could move from one rabbit to another by very close physical contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rabbit, apart from the advent of the European perhaps, has probably turned out to be the most effective imported destroyer of the environment in the history of this country&mdash;or probably, for that matter, in the history of any country. No feral animal has destroyed more vegetation and produced erosion and false drought than has the European rabbit in this country for 100 years. Even after the advent of the very successful myxomatosis virus, which has been operating for some 25 years, the numbers of rabbits are still in the tens of millions, and we are failing to handle the increase in those numbers at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the number of rabbits got to a high of between 600 million and a billion in this country. I remember as a small boy seeing thousands of pairs of ears in the evening light&mdash;the ground bare, warren-ridden and pockmarked&mdash;and in some cases rabbits were 10 feet up the trees, ringbarking the bullock bushes as they went. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people earn a living out of rabbits at the present time as a sort of offshoot of this feral population by either shooting or harvesting them in some way or another. That is fine, but in this case all those people in effect are living off the destruction by the rabbit of private property and the destruction of our landscape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some statements in recent times, since this escape, which I would have to say are somewhat irresponsible. I refer to some statements by Dr Hugh Wirth. I know that Hugh Wirth for five or six years has felt, as President of the RSPCA, that we should be using more humane methods. But I would like to point out to him that since that time, five or six years ago, the debate has come a long way. Last year the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales conducted a two-day seminar, the whole purpose of which was to discuss ways of eradication of feral animals in Australia. That was a big move when you think back to the animal liberation debate of only a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply do not have the luxury of not using the good fortune that we may now have found ourselves in. We have found a vector to move this thing around. It is worth pointing out that this RCV virus is in 40 countries. So far it has never proved effective on anything but the European rabbit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to speak about an issue that is dear to my heart, and that is the seven years of neglect of the Hunter region under the Fahey government. I particularly want to talk about facilities for young athletes in the region. Members opposite will probably not be aware that the Hunter has a greater population than Tasmania and contributes more to the GDP of this nation than most areas&mdash;indeed, more than the whole of Tasmania&mdash;yet we do not have a single first-class athletic facility. This is an area that is less than two hours drive from Sydney that is going to host the Olympics in the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased the other day to hear, less than six months after coming to power, Michael Egan, the Treasurer for New South Wales, indicate that he will pursue the establishment of a first-class facility in the Hunter region. It will be a regional facility, and hopefully it will be constructed on surplus railway land in the suburb of Glendale, which is in the electorate of my very good friend and colleague the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will mean that athletes in our area who do have a national and state ranking will be able to train seriously towards representing their country at the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000. Athletes such as Katie Hall, Jacquie Munro, Mindy Slomka, Andrew Laverick, Lucas Moffat and Clinton Mackevicius&mdash;not all residents of my electorate but people from around the Hunter region&mdash;and dozens of others will now have the opportunity to train with first-class facilities, so guaranteeing that they will be competitive and that Australia will be proud of the effort that they put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, the injection of $4 million, plus the availability of land on which this facility can be constructed, provides another avenue for helping young people in the Hunter region&mdash;and that is employment. I have already approached officers from the Department of Employment, Education and Training and I have approached my federal colleagues from the Hunter and suggested that we should look, under the Working Nation program, at training programs being involved in the development of these facilities. I am confident it will happen. After all, I am sure the skills that young people will learn as they are constructing these facilities will be in great demand in Australia in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. They will be constructing sporting facilities that will be in high demand, not only by Australian athletes but by athletes who will come here for up to 12 months before the Olympics actually take place to acclimatise themselves to Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of any better place to do that than in the Hunter region. Some will go to the Illawarra region. I am aware, Mr Speaker, of your interest in that area. Although it is not as good as the Hunter, it is still quite a good area and certainly close to the major competition centres. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to raise an issue highlighted by the Chairman of the CSIRO, Professor Adrienne Clarke, in her Brodie-Hall address in Perth the night before last. Professor Clarke is one of Australia's leading scientists. She mentioned that Australia risked losing control over one of the most powerful technologies reshaping today's society. She said in her speech that biotechnology is critical to Australia's future in agriculture, the environment and medicine. With the world population predicted to rise to at least 10 billion by the year 2050, biotechnology could transform agriculture and how food is supplied to the world's population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is biotechnology? In Professor Clarke's words, biotechnology is based on two key pieces of knowledge: firstly, we can grow cells of living organisms, plants, animals, bacteria and fungi in culture in artificial conditions and, secondly, we can isolate the genetic material that defines the nature of these cells and move these genes from one cell to another, known as genetic engineering. The main impact of this technology has been felt in agriculture and medicine, but applications in fields such as forensic science, security and mining are becoming commonplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some examples of recent developments include the first engineered fresh tomato, now being sold in shops in the USA, and tomato paste is being manufactured from engineered tomatoes in the United Kingdom. The UK also has green cheese made genetically, and engineered rennet is marketed in the United Kingdom as green cheese, as it does away with using rennet from the stomachs of baby calves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of medicine, children in developing countries can now receive vaccine for cholera and hepatitis B by eating  a genetically engineered banana. On the other side of the coin, biotechnology is all about ownership of that information. There are many controversial issues about patenting, access and equity of that information. Professor Clarke warned that Australia is in very real danger of missing the biotechnology train and being left on the outer, with little control over its developing future. At the moment, rights of advancements and new discoveries made in Australia are usually sold to overseas interests. That means Australia gives up the rights of core technologies and then in the future has to pay the price to use that technology. For example, for every chicken eaten in Australia a royalty is paid to overseas owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Clarke said it is critical that Australia retain control over its own emerging and core technologies, and that this means substantial investment by Australian business in Australian research and commercialisation of products. She said that Australia has the scientific capacity within CSIRO, the universities and a few fledgling companies to be among the world leaders in a few carefully targeted areas. But Australia is a very small player on the international scene and probably accounts for between two and four per cent of all new knowledge in this area, which is about right for our size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether Australia has the framework to retain control over the technology we do develop. Professor Clarke says that presently we probably do not. If Australia fails to change its approach to this issue, it runs the very real risk of losing control of this matter. Professor Clarke argued that a structure similar to the one which kick-started the film industry is essential to commercialise Australian discoveries in biotechnology. I ask the government to consider various policies which could encourage Australian companies to invest in Australian technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht, in his opening address at the last Pacific rim biotechnology conference, said that Australia was aiming to be a leader in innovations, science and advanced industry within the Asia-Pacific region. While Australia has the ability to be a leader in technology, we do not appear to be able to maintain Australian ownership of these rights. Our future is at stake and the government must provide leadership in this area and encourage a climate that is attractive to Australian companies and agencies investing in our technological future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is entirely accurate to say that all members of this House, irrespective of political differences, are agreed that the totality of Australia Remembers ceremonies, some large, some small, all enable this generation of Australians to pause, to take time, to publicly, openly and with a generosity of spirit say thank you to an earlier generation that had borne the brunt and the sacrifice that is endemic in a nation at war. Such moments are important to our sense of community, to our understanding of why we are and who we are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over many years, like other citizens of Melbourne, I have participated at dawn ceremonies and Anzac Day ceremonies. I have been moved to comment on those occasions that, while the ranks grew thinner, the audience grew larger. One aspect of that was the number of younger people, children, who not only attended but increasingly are now participating in those ceremonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is equally true that other events on our calendar&mdash;Christmas and Good Friday&mdash;are occasions when, for the great majority of our citizens, the assertion of spiritual values transcend the material and commercial considerations that are so dominant for the rest of the year. Communities, like man, do not live by bread alone. These events are an essential part of our community and assert our values which are critical to our perceptions of ourselves and our Melbourne community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appalled at the fact that the Victorian Premier, with the cosy complicity of his close friends who operate the Melbourne casino, has blithely accepted the proposition that this is the one major business undertaking that must be permitted to operate on the morning of Anzac Day, when ceremonies are taking place, and on Good Friday and Christmas Day&mdash;days of immense religious significance to members of my community. These are family days. These are days for personal reflections. These are days when `the money changers have no place in the temple'. I am bound to admit that I do not believe in a casino-led recovery, or in a gambling-led recovery. Gambling does not produce wealth: it redistributes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the operators of the casino, it is a redistribution that is immensely profitable for them. For the Victorian government, it is about collecting an indirect tax, a tax that for the most part falls most heavily on those who cannot afford it. To the Premier who has sacked judges, limited rights to compensation, whose commitment to privatisation exceeds his commitment to social equity and justice, I say: enough is enough. Nobody believes that Anzac Day morning, Christmas Day and Good Friday are essential to the operations of a casino. These days are sacred days for the people of Victoria and Melbourne and they are not to be transgressed by the Premier on behalf of his friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, I think, important to remind honourable members opposite of the speeches that they made when this House took the important decision that Anzac Day was a day of national commemoration. I for one accept the sincerity of their commitments as the legislation received the unanimous endorsement of the House. These commitments do not live with the Victorian Premier's cosy complicity with the decision that fundamentally attacks those very commitments, with the decision that involves a placid acceptance that the Melbourne casino is the one and only business that can operate on Christmas Day, Good Friday and the morning of Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the time is now appropriate for not merely members of the Victorian parliament but for members of this parliament to say to the Premier that that is not a position which is consistent with the commitment given on behalf of members of the opposition and unanimously passed by this parliament. Anzac Day and what it stands for are too important. These other sacred ceremonies are too important. They should not be cast aside in terms of the business interests of those who are in positions of power and, unfortunately, are close friends of the Premier of Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill gives effect to an important element in the government's package of shipping reform measures which was announced in the budget on 9 May 1995. The reform package continues the improvement in efficiency and competitiveness of Australia's major trading fleet, and assists in closing the competitive gap between Australian shipping and its major international competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australia's international shipping industry employers, based on the PAYE tax liabilities of seafarers on Australia's international trading ships. In addition to the introduction of the grant under this bill, the reform package includes two other key elements:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the extension from 1 July 1997 until 30 June 2002 of the existing capital assistance measures available under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 and the associated accelerated depreciation regime under section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These measures, which at least equate to the capital incentives provided by other shipping nations, will encourage the continued investment in modern ships. The necessary amendments to the two acts will be introduced in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the implementation of the complementary industry efficiency reform measures developed by the shipowners and maritime unions in the Maritime Industry Restructuring Agreement, known as MIRA. These include a greater flexibility in the operation of the seafarers engagement system (the pooled labour scheme for ratings) and other measures which provide ship operators with the kind of cost savings and other benefits more generally associated with company employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Shipowners Association has estimated that, across the current major trading fleet (which includes both coastal and international trading ships), savings of some $15 million per year can be achieved under MIRA. The reform measures introduced by MIRA will also deliver cost savings and efficiencies to the offshore industry supply fleet which services Australia's offshore petroleum and gas industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of the government's reform package is based upon the recommendations of the August 1994 report by the then Chairman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, Mr Rae Taylor AO. This report recognised the achievement of the reform programs implemented by government and the shipping industry since the early 1980s. These reforms had focused on reductions in crewing levels, a radical restructure of seafarer training and the introduction of modern, technologically advanced, fuel efficient ships into the Australian fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade Australian shipowners have invested some $1.6 billion in new tonnage. The average age of ships in the Australian fleet is 11 years, compared with 18 years in the world fleet. In 1983, a typical Australian trading ship had a crew of 33; today, that figure is 18. While in 1983 the Australian average crew size was well in excess of OECD levels, our crew levels are now lower. These are remarkable achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent years there has been a trend by OECD national flag operators towards registering their vessels under open or international registers. These registers typically offer attractive taxation regimes and the ability to replace wholly national crews with lower-cost mixed nationality crews, predominantly from the developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taylor report found that, as a result of this changed overseas situation, the competitive gap between Australian ships and comparable overseas ships operating under international registers was about $2 million per ship per year. The report, having examined the main areas of cost disabilities affecting Australian shipping, concluded that the PAYE taxation regime had a major impact on Australia's competitive position. Accordingly, the report recommended removal of the PAYE taxation cost element from Australia's international trading ships in order to match the position of overseas ship operators, where crews are exempt from PAYE taxation or where the taxation impact on crew costs is offset by other concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accepted the thrust of the Taylor report findings. After examining a range of options in the crew taxation area, the government has decided that a grant based on the notional tax liabilities of seafarers serving on ships trading internationally would be the most effective and practicable means of achieving the objective. The bill now before the House introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australian shipping industry employers, based on the notional PAYE taxation liabilities on the earnings of Australian-resident crew members on ships in Australia's international trading fleet. Seafarers will, of course, have their PAYE tax deducted in the normal way and, like every other taxpayer, will be able to claim the rebates and deductions to which they are entitled in respect of their total earnings for the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the details of the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2, which takes in clauses 3 to 7, explains the expressions and definitions used in the bill. Clause 3 defines an `eligible ship' to mean `an Australian-operated commercial trading ship with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tonnes or more'. Clause 4 defines an `Australian-operated' ship to include ships on demise charter to Australian entities, as well as ships owned by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 defines the meaning of `international voyage'. This is an important definition, as time spent on international voyages is one of the key criteria for qualifying for the grant. Calls at intermediate Australian ports as part of an overall international voyage are permitted, provided that any coastal cargo carried between Australian ports does not exceed the international cargo on board. In clause 7 are to be found general definitions, such as `seafarer', `Australian-resident seafarer' and `seafarer berth'. These again are important definitions as the grant is only payable in respect of bona fide, duly qualified seafarers who are ordinarily resident in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would mention at this point that the term `seafarer berth' is used throughout the bill in the sense of a crew position or job on a ship, rather than simply a cabin or a bed. By adopting the concept of the seafarer berth and using the notional tax on the award wages or enterprise agreement wages, as applicable for that berth, the computation of the grant amount is reduced to a relatively straightforward calculation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill, which covers clauses 8 to 12, contains the elements for establishing the entitlement to the grant and calculating the grant amount. Clause 8 sets the basic parameters for entitlement to the grant. Essentially, the grant is payable to the employer of the crew of an eligible ship which has spent the requisite number of days in international trade. Clause 9 sets out the method of calculating the amount of grant unit for each seafarer berth. Factored into the grant calculation is the number of days in the year that each berth is actually occupied by an Australian-resident seafarer. Therefore, if any berths are occupied by nonresidents, or if any berths are unoccupied during a repair or lay-up period or because the ship is sailing short-handed, then the grant units calculated for those berths will be reduced proportionately. The grant amount is simply the sum of the grant units for the seafarer berths on the ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 10 establishes the eligible employment period, which is the period in respect of which the grant is paid. This clause also determines that the grant is to be paid to the actual employer of the crew and that the employer must be an Australian entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of ship operators in Australia appoint a management company to look after the day-to-day running of the ship, including crew related matters such as paying salaries and making the PAYE tax deductions. In such circumstances, it would be the management company that is the actual employer, not the operator. Because of the notional linkage between the grant and crew PAYE income tax, it follows that the employer of the crew is the appropriate recipient of the grant. Clearly, if the employer and the ship operator are not the same entity, they will need to reach a commercial agreement on the allocation of the grant moneys once paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the employer employs the crew on a ship for the whole year, the `eligible employment period' is the whole year. If the employer only employs the crew for a part year, then the `eligible employment period' would only apply to the part year. These eligible employment periods are not transferable. For example, if during the period covered by the first employer the ship is wholly engaged in international trading and during the period covered by the second employer the ship is mainly engaged in coastal trading, the international trading days accrued by the first employer could not be transferred to the second employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 11 sets out the formula for calculating the minimum number of days in international trading to qualify for the grant. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will note that the formula excludes non-operational days of repair, maintenance or lay-up from the minimum days calculation. There will thus be no advantage for an operator to obtain repairs, or lay-up the ship, overseas simply in order to accumulate more international trading days. However, once a ship has crossed the minimum days international trading threshold, the grant is payable in respect of the berth occupancy over the full eligible employment period, which would include any days of repairs, maintenance or lay-up. The grant will be paid annually in arrears after receipt of appropriate documentation from the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of grant is determined by clause 12 of the bill. The grant payable is the sum of the notional tax liabilities calculated on the award or enterprise agreement wages relating to the various seafarer berths on the ship. The method of determining eligibility and calculating the amount of grant is very straightforward and will not impose a significant administrative workload on the employer in substantiating a claim for a grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements will be administered by the Department of Transport, with the departmental secretary being the nominated decision-maker in respect of applications for grants. There are appropriate safeguards in the bill to enable authorised persons appointed by the secretary to make any necessary investigations to verify the substance of claim applications and to prevent fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In common with other legislation involving administrative decisions, clause 22 of the bill provides for an Administrative Appeals Tribunal review, if there is dissatisfaction with a decision made in relation to a claim for a grant. The bill also facilitates parliamentary scrutiny of the scheme. Clause 25 requires the secretary to submit to the minister of the day a return of the grants paid in the previous year, and for the minister to table the return before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, through this bill, the crew taxation disadvantages for Australian operators will be eliminated. Furthermore, by providing the benefit direct to employers, the whole amount will be directed to narrowing the competitive gap. This bill, together with the industry reforms implemented through the maritime industry restructuring agreement, will promote a more competitive international fleet. It must be remembered that, as recently as 25 years ago, Australian shipping had minimal involvement in international trades. Now there are some 30 ships regularly trading overseas. These ships are competing directly with overseas operated vessels at prevailing international freight rates, largely by exploiting market niches. This government's previous shipping reform measures have played a major role in this achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant to be implemented by this bill is an integral part of a new shipping reform package which raises the benchmark for Australian shipping and provides the wherewithal to take the industry into the next century. It continues the cooperative reform process begun in the early 1980s and provides new initiatives to allow Australian shipping to improve its competitiveness in the international shipping market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

How we handle that in the management of affairs in this chamber I do not know. As I understand it, Mr Deputy Speaker, this chamber is for non-controversial legislation. However, we will be opposing it and dividing on it, so if you want me to proceed I shall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we will be opposing this legislation is that this is simply yet another rort for the Maritime Union of Australia, the great friends of the Labor Party here in Canberra and around Australia. As the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, will tell you, the Maritime Union of Australia is the heart and soul of the Labor movement in Australia, and it is for this reason that the taxpayers of Australia are dipping into their pockets to the tune of $19 million, in this specific instance, as they have been dipping into their pockets, or the government on their behalf has been dipping very deeply into their pockets, over the last many years to fund the rorts of the Maritime Union of Australia in various activities this government has embarked upon for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case we are spending $19 million of taxpayers' funds as the consequence of a deal that was struck to try and resolve a dispute that I think basically revolves around the privatisation of ANL. We can all recall a strike that took place last year as a consequence of the decision by the government to sell the share of Australian Stevedores, now known as Patricks, that was owned by ANL. You will recall a dispute that took place at that time, a national waterfront strike that cost this country probably in the order of $60 million in direct costs and many millions of dollars more in terms of indirect costs because of the enhanced reputation for unreliability this country has for its waterfront. As a result of that dispute, the government decided to do yet another taxpayer funded deal for its mates in the Maritime Union of Australia, and here we are today with living evidence of the cost of that deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other examples of the way in which this government has reached deep into the pockets of the Australian taxpayers to fund the rorts of its mates. Today in the press, in relation to the sale of ANL, which is a central feature of the Australian shipping industry and indeed is seen as an icon by the Maritime Union of Australia, we see the farce, and the very expensive farce, of the incompetence of the government's management of the sale of ANL. It reflects also the incompetence of the government's management of our shipping and maritime industries here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find out that we are not likely to have the sale of ANL to P&amp;O proceed, as we had been told would be the case by the government since early this year. The Maritime Union of Australia has in effect vetoed the sale of ANL to P&amp;O on the grounds that it basically does not like P&amp;O. There has been a historic fight between the Maritime Union of Australia and P&amp;O, and as a consequence of it this government has handed over to the Maritime Union of Australia the veto rights on the privatisation of ANL. We see that the Maritime Union of Australia has done exactly what people predicted would be done, and that is use that veto to stop the sale and to leave the ANL shipping company in the hands of the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of that is enormous. We are seeing in this legislation today $19 million worth of taxpayer funded rorts for the Maritime Union of Australia. But, if you look at the way in which this government has bowed to the whims and fancies of the Maritime Union of Australia over the sale of ANL, the cost of that to the Australian taxpayer is over $100 million dollars. Indeed, somewhere in the order of $145 million is the cost of the fiasco of ANL. That is the cost of this government's bowing down to the influence and pressures the MUA has imposed on the government over the management of and ultimate attempt to privatise ANL. It is some $145 million, plus $19 million per annum, plus the $816,000 that has been paid to Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other member of the ANL board. </PARA>

Two days a week for one year and people like Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull are picking up something in the order of $300,000 for themselves. As a consequence of that, a total $816,000 has been shared amongst the three mates of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we start to see the bill adding up: $19 million for the shipping legislation; $145 million for the fiasco of ANL; and $816,000 for the three mates of the Minister for Transport led by Neville Wran. We also see the cost of the redundancies within the Shipping Industry Reform Authority process which amounted to something like $17.39 million and was yet another taxpayer funded rearrangement of the affairs of the Australian shipping industry. That makes a total cost of $71.29 million, of which $53.9 million was paid by employers, as well as the part paid for by the government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then if we look at the waterfront operations of Australia, which are an integral part of the Maritime Union of Australia, we come up with an additional bill of $450 million which was paid to some 4,000-odd retiring wharfies who were made redundant as a consequence of the government's so-called Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program. That $450 million was on top of the normal superannuation, accumulative sick leave and long service leave payments that those 4,000-odd retiring wharfies received as part of the government's reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We start to draw together a very expensive picture of the way in which the government does business with the Maritime Union of Australia: $450 million for the MUA wharfies; $53.9 million for the Shipping Industry Reform Authority; $816,000 for the three mates; then another $145 million for the losses of ANL; and now $19 million for the legislation that is being debated here today. In anybody's book, that is an enormous amount of money for very little gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We question a number of points made in the speech given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous). He was simply reading a speech prepared by the minister's office, which he did with some degree of competence. For example, the government likes to use the great line which says that crew numbers of Australian ships are equal to those of international shipping trading nations. It is true, crew numbers are equal, but the fact of the matter is that crew to berth ratios in Australia for Australian flag vessels are much higher than those of most other shipping nations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes 2.3 crew to fill every berth on an Australian ship. A comparable nation with a much more efficient shipping industry would require about 1.7 crew per berth to fill each position on its ships. So here in Australia, because of the work practices in our maritime industry&mdash;six weeks on, six weeks off, somebody on sick leave, somebody on long service leave and somebody doing some training&mdash;it requires more crew to keep an Australian flag vessel operating than it does vessels from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can draw other comparisons in terms of wages. Many people would point out that, even with comparable nations, Australian crews are paid more money than those in other nations. No doubt the government members would try to draw a comparison by saying, `You're comparing us with Burmese workers or Filipino workers.' No, we are not. We are comparing our sailors with sailors from countries which are like-minded countries to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all of the costs that the Australian taxpayers have had to fork out, despite all of the talk, all of the time and all of the effort involved in trying to generate shipping reform in Australia, we still do not have a shipping industry that is competitive on all of the important points with other shipping nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason is that the MUA will not allow these things to occur. The MUA, for some reason, is so important that this government will not stand up to it, and will not do anything but dip into the taxpayer's pocket to try to solve the problem. Here today we have an example of precisely that: the taxpayers having another $19 million ripped out of their pockets by this government, to try to solve a little domestic problem for the labour movement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we really wanted to have an efficient shipping industry, be it international or domestic, we could move towards company employment. I know that the government says, `Yes, but we are going down the path that achieves similar results as company employment.' But you will not achieve the same results unless you have company employment, as is the case in so many other countries around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not have an efficient and competitive shipping industry until all of the recommendations of the Rae Taylor report are implemented. It is interesting to note that the parliamentary secretary, reading his speech prepared by the minister's office, said that the government has picked up the main parts of the Taylor report. That is true. But they left out some other key aspects of the Taylor report, and the reason they left those key aspects out was simply that the MUA did not agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to start to go down the path of having an efficient world competitive shipping industry that this country can be proud of, earning real dollars that do not cost the taxpayers money, there are many good recommendations in the Taylor report which, if they were picked up in total, would benefit the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, if the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report of 1987-89, which flowed from the Webber report of 1984-86, were picked up in their entirety and implemented as a package&mdash;instead of some of the points from that report being selectively taken up, and some others dropped&mdash;we would have an efficient and internationally competitive waterfront in Australia. We do not have an efficient Australian waterfront because this government did not pick the hard bits of the Inter-State Commission's recommendations of April 1989, just as they have not picked up the hard bits of the Rae Taylor report of last year, in relation to the shipping industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of factors that have to be considered in this debate. One factor is the cost of the grant. When the government first announced the provision of a tax-free status for international seafarers, it was supposed to be a tax arrangement. It was not intended, as far as we could understand, to be given in the form of a direct grant. It is interesting to note that this grant is valued at about $19 million a year. You watch over the next few years, as coastal traders start to rearrange their schedules to ensure that they are eligible for the grant as well. I will bet my bottom dollar on the fact that those people in the coastal trades will see an opportunity to get some money for themselves out of this scheme; they will make rearrangements to their schedules, and they will have their snouts in the trough by getting into this grant system as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of this grant costing us $19 million a year, as the government is boldly predicting, we can expect the cost to blow out several times over. We are going to see more and more money being poured down the throats of the Maritime Union of Australia and the government's mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on this side of the House have real concerns about this legislation. We oppose it, and we oppose it strongly.

That is what people have had a gutful about, because you are treating people in a way that is not equitable. It is here in this legislation and, over the past few years, in the way you have handled shipping industry reform, waterfront reform, and indeed the way in which you have handled the privatisation of ANL.

The House will see an enormous amount of money going down the drain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the way the government has handled the privatisation of ANL. When it announced that you could not give ANL away&mdash;remember that the Minister for Transport said in that famous press conference, `You could not give it away'&mdash;ANL, according to the analysis of most people, indeed several consulting firms, accounting firms and even the Auditor-General's assessment of ANL at the time, giving a positive valuation, was roughly valued at $28 million. That was on the day the Minister for Transport declared, `You could not give it away.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of his actions, his decisions, his incompetence, his preparedness to bend over backwards to the MUA, ANL&mdash;if you can sell it today after all this fooling about&mdash;will be worth nothing. The taxpayers, as we have seen in this House, will have going through the House a grant of $15 million being made available to assist in the sale of ANL. I forgot to add that to the bill. So add $15 million to all the other handouts that we have had for the shipping and waterfront industries and you can see for yourself that this government has poured an enormous amount of money down the drain when it comes to the waterfront and our shipping industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be justifiable to do that if, at the end of the day, we were going to have a world competitive shipping industry or a world competitive waterfront industry. But the fact of the matter is we do not now and we will not, as a consequence of this legislation or other actions undertaken by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all this money is being wasted. All this money is being wasted and achieving nothing, in terms of helping to make Australia a more competitive and efficient nation and helping Australian businesses to export more products so that we can create more jobs. At the end of the day, all of this is designed to create more jobs. If we have a world efficient waterfront and a world efficient shipping industry, we will create more jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that we have 8.5 per cent official unemployment and probably 14 or 15 per cent unofficial unemployment?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to take the broader interests of the Australian community to heart, as should be the job of a government, we should be trying to develop as efficient and cost-effective an Australian maritime industry as possible, because the consequence of that will be that we create more jobs for Australians in downstream industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government is not interested in doing that. That is why we have an 8.5 per cent official unemployment level and a great deal higher unofficial unemployment level in Australia. The reason for that is the government's inability to tackle hard areas of reform, such as the waterfront, the shipping industry, the privatisation of companies such as ANL and industrial relations reform in Australia. It has reformed many other facets of Australian life but, when it comes to industrial relations reform, it has been a softly, softly, pour out the money approach that this government has taken. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this was not acknowledged by the previous speaker at all. He implied that this bill had come out of somebody's head and had no relationship whatsoever to international shipping. Well, this bill does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the coalition mentions selling. The coalition has always had a history of selling anything which is Australian, never protecting, never exploiting and never getting into encouraging Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Sharp mentioned wharfies, and he was great at building up what a wharfie got to retire on. I do not think wharfies retire on a lot of money; I am sure that most of us in this House will retire on a lot more than the wharfies retire on. It is a very poor comparison to make. Getting stuck into people who work on the waterfront and who have been made redundant or retired from their job, and somehow giving them a free kick&mdash;because kicking wharfies goes down great at a farmers' meeting&mdash;is pretty old hat. In today's world, we should be a bit broader in our views. We often hear that we should be looking at industrial relations in a different light and treating things in a different way. We still do not get that from the other side of the House. As I said, it is still looked at in terms of getting a free kick and kicking wharfies at a farmers' meeting. The opposition thinks this gains it some electoral advantage, but the country does not gain at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker also said that other countries, when compared with Australia, had much cheaper shipping. He said that we cannot use crews from the Philippines or Burma which the other countries use. He did not name the other countries because he knows that it is practically impossible to do so. He knows that the reforms that have already taken place in Australia make our shipping rates comparable with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other countries have incredibly bad histories in regard to treatment of their seafarers. The honourable member would be well aware of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. He would be aware of this bad treatment in other countries and of the ships that other countries allow to sail the seas of the world. Australia should not be ashamed of its high standard of income and its conditions for seafarers. It should not be ashamed that it sets standards for the rest of the world to come up to. We should not back down. We should not be the lowest common denominator when paying wages: people should not get paid after three months; they should not have dreadful conditions and food. The previous speaker was trying to get us sucked into that and we should not be sucked in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said that farmers received a lot less than wharfies or seafarers. I thought that was a very poor analysis of the government's assistance. Farmers, in my electorate, have received very good assistance. I am very proud to say that we were able to assist those who needed assistance due to the droughts in Tasmania. RAS has put millions and millions of dollars into rural Australia. Farmers make great gains from reforms that have already occurred on the waterfront through technologies. I went to the terminal at Botany Bay where 50 per cent reform has occurred in the container area. A lot of that has to do with technology and electronic transfers. When things come in containers, the computers take over when they hit the waterfront. The wharfie driving the forklift gets the information and is better able to stack the yards. When the ship comes in, it is much easier. Those sorts of reforms have taken place and the whole economy of Australia gains from that, including our rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to provide a system of grants to Australian shipowners who undertake international voyages. The grants will place Australian ship operators on a more equitable footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs and provide an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities. The bill came about because of the restructuring in the shipping industry and the fact that the Australian government's principal objective is to ensure that Australian shippers have continuing access to competitive and efficient liner shipping services which are crucial to expanding trade interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), cabinet ministers, the ACTU and maritime unions met to negotiate an industry reform package. As a result of negotiations, the Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, announced that the government had agreed to an introduction of a taxable outlays grant to be paid to owners and operators of Australian registered ships predominantly engaged in international trade. It would offset the impact on owners and operators of personal income tax on the earnings of seafarers on Australia's eligible international trading ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that international shipping is important to Australia because it carries $35 billion worth of goods into Australia and $43 billion worth of exports from Australia. Currently, around 30 Australian operated ships are engaged in international trade. On this basis, the value of grants payable in respect of the first year, 1995-96, will be $19 million payable in arrears in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the other part of the arrangement, whereby the unions were looking at developing a consortium to acquire a majority interest in ANL with the government returning a minority shareholding, could not be shaken up and shaken out and made to happen. The unions have come a long way down the track in their reform package, including looking at the reduction in crew sizes, the crewing factors and changes to their employment arrangements. But it seems that it will still be a long time before Australians know whether we will still have a shipping line which we can call Australian or whether we will be at the whim of other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of agreement under which this bill was formulated were that the government was planning not to liquidate ANL but to restructure it, which, of course, may make it an economically viable enterprise. It was recognised that the competitiveness of ANL and other Australian international shipping operators depends on a range of factors, and they include taxation and industrial arrangements. Although this bill might go part of the way to ensuring that Australians still crew ships working in and out of Australia, it does little to ensure the integrity of the Australian shipping industry with an Australian owned shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea for this bill came forward as there was general knowledge among shipowners of other developed nations that they had access to their countries' special fiscal arrangements that were not available to Australian shipowners. There is a seven per cent taxable capital grant available but not all ships qualify for this as there are many ships which are chartered by Australians from foreign owners, and the grant does not apply to ships which are chartered or leased from non-Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most shipowners knew with precision the details of a wide variety of assistance measures made available in a number of OECD countries which were not available in Australia. Japan, the United States of America, France, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom were used as examples of differing approaches to international shipping industries. This intelligence was used to demonstrate the impact of different measures on the cost regime of Australian ships. The measures tested had to be commercially, politically and industrially sensitive and had to have equal application to vessels being operated by owners in a variety of commercial circumstances. The common factor was reduction in labour costs, but it was thought this should not be done at the expense of employees on the ships. So it was decided to look at the Danish idea of removing the PAYE element from the employer's gross payroll and that was adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was industrially neutral as it did not encourage the employment of foreign nationals; it was of equal benefit to all operators as it reduced labour costs; and it was politically sustainable as it would apply to Australian taxpayers who were absent from the country for a very substantial period during the year. Thus there was no change to the employees' net pay. So this bill should assist in the growth of Australian shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 foreign shipping carrying Australia's external trade accounted for about $2.5 billion of our deficit on net services in the current account. This represented, by itself, 15 per cent of the current account deficit in 1993-94. Any growth of Australian participation in the carriage of Australian external trade will directly contribute to a reduction in the deficit on services in the current account analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that operators of coastal shipping are already rearranging their shipping schedules to ensure the eligibility of their ships for a grant under the terms of this bill. The effect of this will be to reduce the operating costs of those ships and the resultant savings will directly benefit the users of coastal shipping services. So although I believe this bill will be useful to help Australian owned and crewed ships, I would still like the whole arrangement to be considered so that ANL still remains part of our culture and our industry, and is owned by Australia. I have great pleasure in supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened carefully to the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) trying to defend the government's position on the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 and I am in some difficulty in understanding the line of reasoning. The bottom line is that the government is subsidising ANL to the extent of $20 million in an attempt to buy off the Maritime Union of Australia. They have put pressure on the government by way of strike action and the government has caved in and tried to do a deal with the union in an endeavour to keep Australian ports open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyons struggled valiantly to defend that position with some facts and some figures that are not really relevant to the main argument. The situation is that this ANL saga is hopefully coming to a conclusion. We see in this morning's press that it still remains to be finally concluded with a sale to P&amp;O. Again, the MUA are instrumental in preventing that final sale, but I will deal with that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill is the legislative conclusion of a deal brokered between the government and the ACTU and the Maritime Union on 13 September 1994 after the MUA had instigated a five-day national strike to gain their point of view. They were worried, as we all know, about the future sale of ANL and what might turn up. The government has been trying to sell ANL since 1991. In September last year the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) relied on one valuation and said, in his classic quote, that ANL `could not be given away'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House of Representatives only 10 days ago most of us on our side of politics clearly set out the arguments of the strange and wide range of valuations of ANL that took place, and yet that shipping line has yet to be sold. Minister Brereton sacked the board, put the ANL back for sale and, as of today, we have P&amp;O making the offer of $19.5 million, less the losses that have been accrued from 1 April to 31 October. It is estimated that ANL is losing $2 million a month. So not only has the sale not gone through, but the government is certainly accumulating losses at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation we have today is very relevant to this bill. It is worth quoting from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today, under the heading `ANL deal heads for the rocks', which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government's strategy to manage the sale of ANL is in tatters after the refusal of the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, to push the powerful maritime union into a deal with the British shipping group P&amp;O.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had expected Mr Kelty to salvage the continuing fiasco of the shipping line's proposed sale by getting the unions to agree to terms.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have the situation where this very bill was part of the agreement that the government would do a deal with the Maritime Union on the basis that they would avert a strike and that, hopefully, the sale would go through. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it now turns out that the only likely exit route Mr Kelty foresees is the same as that pushed by the Maritime Union of Australia: restructuring under continuing government ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>And it further goes on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have it quite clearly where the ACTU stand and where the Maritime Union stand in the whole argument. The maritime waterfront strike was used for blackmailing purposes, closing the ports for five days in order to get their point of view across. I draw the attention of the parliament to the political blockade that took place in Western Australia only yesterday. It had similar connotations and similar points of view, that is, the Western Australian government, legitimately, were threatening the privileged position of the trade union bosses in that state.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other reforms included no more political donations from membership subscriptions to a particular party unless people decided to make that particular donation to a political party, a choice of a superannuation fund and not being coerced into a superannuation fund because the union hierarchy told people they had to do it, and ensuring that the unions chose between a state and federal award. They are all quite sensible suggestions and no basis for the major strike which held up the whole of Western Australia yesterday. That strike was purely political, as most Australians would understand, with Perth airport held up and the state transport instrumentalities at a standstill. It was all done for political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we have the situation with the MUA using their considerable clout to hold up the ports around Australia just to get their own way. As Greg Bondar, the executive director of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, estimated, the national waterfront strike cost shipping $55 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Shipping further estimated that 200 ships had been stuck in Australian ports during the five-day stoppage. To end the strike, which is the key argument, Minister Brereton offered an exemption of PAYE tax for all Australian seafarers engaged in international shipping. That was the deal after all this argument. As usual Minister Brereton said, `Here's a bit of a deal,' through Mr Kelty, his friend in the ACTU, `This is the way we will solve it.' Whilst the workers did not receive any additional take home pay, the exemption would make Australian seafarers up to $20,000 cheaper to employ, if you do some of the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the figures. According to the Australian Shipowners Association, the base rate of pay for crew members is $40,000 per annum. That is not a bad rate of pay by anyone's standards. They have six months on and six months off. Again, that is not a bad set of conditions. They are on board 24 hours a day seven days a week and it is obviously fairly difficult and arduous work&mdash;I concede that. They work eight hours a day plus overtime. That is the nature of seafaring activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, which I have been associated with, looked at the problem of crews from overseas. They work from nine to 10 months for considerably less remuneration but it is hard to work out exactly what that is and what the conditions are. Through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure the parliament has been trying to bring about a better set of conditions at the international level. However, it does not give the government the right, in an industrial dispute, to use taxpayers' money to overcome the problem of the Maritime Union of Australia trying to get the ships and break the strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Shipping Industry Reform Authority estimates the savings to this particular taxpayer subsidy would be in the range of $700,000 per annum. Obviously, shipowners are quite happy about receiving, yet again, a taxpayer subsidy to keep their operation going. The key element is the tax break which has been suggested. Mr David Russell of the Taxation Institute of Australia said that the decision to provide PAYE tax breaks would produce a greater complexity in the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the remarkable situation where the minister said, `We'll give a tax break to the maritime seafarers on Australian ships,' and we had a conflict with Treasury and the tax office. Both Treasury and the tax office felt that the concession would be better provided through direct grant payments rather than through tax exemptions. However, as usual, Minister Laurie Brereton was not convinced, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 December 1994 reported that Mr Brereton believed that the PAYE exemption was `the least complicated option' and that he was `confident of winning Treasury support' for his proposal. Needless to say, on this occasion, Treasury won and Minister Brereton lost. It is really an outrageous proposal to suggest that particular workers in the Australian context would have their tax paid by way of a direct government grant. What a remarkable proposition: that Australian seafarers would have Australian taxpayers paying their tax just to win a political deal!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grants that the government is proposing total $19 million per year, just to win a short-term political impasse between the union movement and the government. The argument was between the government's proposal to sell the ANL&mdash;quite legitimately; it has been up-front about that since 1991&mdash;and the Maritime Union being unhappy about that. These grants, on the basis on which they were originally proposed, were a blatant breach of the principles of original PAYE tax exemption, and they still remain a pay-off to the union, as I say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum of the bill states that the grants are being paid in order to place Australian operators in a better position, `on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs' and will `provide an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities'. What a remarkable thing, when ANL has been losing money for most of its existence!

The Taylor report, issued in August 1994, stated that Australia's international shipping industry faced competitive disadvantages due to high government taxes and charges&mdash;I stress that they were high government taxes&mdash;as well as inefficient wages and conditions for crew. Some of us, including the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), have been very close to these arguments over the past few years in terms of improvements, but we note in the Taylor report that government charges were one of the key factors in our shipping arrangements being internationally non-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taylor recommendations included a clawing back of the cabotage protection, smaller crew sizes, and tax exemptions for the industry. Following the five-day national waterfront strike, the only recommendation which the government followed up was the PAYE tax exemption, along with a guarantee to the MUA that Australian crewing and award conditions would remain on the ANL. That is the key to the whole argument that P&amp;O is concerned about. If it purchases this particular operation, P&amp;O wants to have its own terms and conditions as it sees fit in a commercial operation; and, of course, the MUA just will not agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taylor report was in fact all but ignored, except for the PAYE tax sweetener, and I have indicated to the parliament exactly why that was the situation. It really shows the hypocrisy of the minister claiming that the grants are part of a drive for greater competitiveness. They are simply a sweetheart deal to buy industrial peace from the MUA. Any citizen of Australia who has any understanding of the waterfront and of those arguments would clearly understand this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the arguments of how much ANL carries of our trade. Australian ships, in fact, carry only three per cent of all Australian international trade&mdash;a very small percentage&mdash;yet we get this major debate and argument about the role of ANL and the conditions of Australian seafarers. As I understand it, there are 21 Australian shipowners and 78 Australian owned and registered flag ships, and 30 of these are involved in international shipping. The grants that have been forward by the parliament will be in respect of 1,000 to 1,200 Australian seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us draw a comparison with what the government might do for other sections of the community. On 13 September 1994, at a time when 40,000 Australian farmers were affected by the worst drought on record, the government found only $14 million to assist them. On the one hand, we have 1,200 seafarers who are close to the government and close to Mr Kelty. The seafarers are receiving $20 million and yet the government could find only $14 million to assist farmers who are providing valuable and important export income and there are very carefully regulated conditions about the way in which the assistance could be given. With the farmers, there was not an open cheque as is the situation with the shipowners. The poor old Australian farmers struggled through that drought as best they could and with very little government assistance because they did not have the entree to the ACTU that the Maritime Union of Australia obviously does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Jack Waterford of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times </EMPHASIS>put it very clearly when he wrote an article in 1994 called `Me too please, Minister, me too!' drawing these comparisons. Mr Waterford said that the political lobbying industry would be thrilled by the deal struck between the government and the MUA. Anyone who wants to get an understanding of how to do a good job just has to have a look at the form guide here. Mr Waterford said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all, if the shipping industry can get this sort of assistance, why should other sectors not hold their hand out for similar concessions?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Waterford, an independent commentator on the situation, drew this comparison. Mr Waterford went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are not international airline crews in the same position? Could not the wheat industry claim that its international competitiveness is cruelled by domestic taxation arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA>Why should they not seek $20 million by way of government handout if they decide to hold up international airlines for three days? Why not hold them up for five days and see what the government would do in this situation and what Minister Brereton might offer by way of peace to get the airlines back in the air. Mr Waterford went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government might find itself not only continuing to send good money after bad, but coping with hordes descending on Canberra claiming that the sailors' treatment is the appropriate precedent for their own situations. Some will seem to have convincing cases&mdash;even if they can't blackmail the Government with a $10 million a day strike. But that's the problem with failing to run a consistent tax policy and making little deals for short-term solutions to continuing problems.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Charles Armstrong, representing the New South Wales Farmers Federation, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do farmers have to take some form of illegal action to get government to help them at this time of drought? Farmers have not engaged in what was an illegal strike. They played by the rules and are yet to gain satisfaction, while militant maritime union members have gained their demands after a six-day strike that threatened Australia's vital export markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a very stark comparison between the government's attitude to drought stricken farmers and its attitude to some of its own mates within the trade union movement with the help of Bill Kelty. Bill Kelty is on the record as being very close to the Maritime Union and as saying that they are the heart and soul of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Alan Wood, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, wrote this very interesting piece:</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Wood is a respected commentator. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MUA runs a closed union shop in the maritime industry, protected by the Government and the industrial legislation. As a result of its monopoly position as a seller of maritime labour, the MUA is able to extract wages and employment conditions well above their true market value. Employers have had no choice but to pay up, although since they could pass the cost on in higher port and shipping charges, they have not complained much until recent years, when there has been more pressure from customers as a result of micro-economic reform elsewhere in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>This information sums up the situation that the Maritime Union is able to exert considerable pressure on the government. We have the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 before the parliament in order to pay $20 million to enhance the conditions of Australian ship-owners as a result of political activity. The situation is not as a result of a sensible, well thought out position of making Australian ships more competitive; it is just more tax payers' dollars in an attempt to keep afloat a small proportion of the international fleet which helps in the export of Australian goods and services and an attempt to keep Australian ports open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is these blackmail tactics by the MUA which forced the Minister for Transport to provide this assistance to the 1,200 seafarers and we have this amazing situation before the parliament where $20 million is being used to pay for peace on the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope some of the reforms that some of us have seen on the waterfront, in terms of moving containers and better industrial relations, will flow through and continue to improve. I am not one to criticise the waterside workers. I think there are a number of other elements on the waterfront&mdash;the stevedores, the shipowners and some of the historical pressures&mdash;that need improving. But this particular decision by the government does not encourage anyone on the waterfront to expect that better, more stable and more sensible conditions could prevail. It sets the clock back to a situation where the government, in times of crisis, will always ask the poor old taxpayer to pay up yet again to solve an internal, domestic, political, union problem. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipping is an important industry to this country. In 1992-93, our exports totalled more than $60 billion and those commodities included meat, minerals, fuels, manufactures, coal and processed foods. Approximately 70 per cent of our agricultural products and the vast majority of our mineral resources are exported and traded in overseas markets. In this context shipping is a vital component of the nation's economy and of Australia's ability to meet international trade demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to Australian shipping, the Australian Shipowners Association, in partnership with the maritime trade unions, has over the last few years embarked on a restructuring of the industry. It is a restructuring that has produced cost savings in the vicinity of $7 million per annum. Australian shipping is now amongst the most labour efficient in the world and crewing levels have been reduced from 30 on average to 18 per vessel. That is lower than OECD levels and well below the world average of 23. In contrast to the increasing age of international ships, which on average is 17 years, the average age of Australian ships is 10 years. It is a younger fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these circumstances Australia should be recognised as having the capacity to compete with other countries. But crewing costs are not the only costs. There are other advantages that our competitors have by way of tax benefits and tax concessions that are not shared, that will not be available in this country until this legislation passes. The challenge for Australia is to place our shipping on a similar footing to that which operates in the nations of our competitors. That means we need to develop and make markets. We need to be using the same strategy and we need to be using our own vessels for greater export effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In overseas areas there is a range of assistance mechanisms. Foreign fleets are often heavily subsidised and the ships that carry Australia's trade are in receipt of numerous financial incentives from their governments. Singaporean maritime companies offer Australian seagoing deck officers or engineering officers, recognised by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, remuneration in tax-free US dollars. In other words, if you have an Australian master's ticket, or mate or engineer's certificates, those companies will employ you but they will pay you in tax-free US dollars. That is the kind of comparison that we have to make with our international traders and with our international fleets here in Australia. </PARA>

But Cyprus also figures prominently as a flag of shame. Cyprus is increasingly a haven for operators of substandard shipping.

The basic amount paid for each seafarer berth to the employer is essentially the amount of income tax that would have been paid by the person occupying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill recognises Australia's exclusive economic zone and extends the provision to an anchorage in the zone or the fishing grounds on the high seas, and this takes account of Australia's vast maritime territory. It enables vessels operating in these areas to meet the competitive challenges that are presented to them when they seek to trade against other international companies. So the government is, in this legislation, honouring its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is in agreement with the Australian Shipowners Association, which stated that tax concessions on the cost of employing Australian seafarers and Australian vessels which spend more than half of their time in international trades would be economically and socially sensible.

Australian seafarers and Australian seafaring unions do not receive one cent of the payments to be made under this legislation. I made that point on several earlier occasions. The tax that would have been paid by the Australian seafarers is taken by the qualifying Australian shipping companies, and it will help place those employers on a fairer footing when compared with their international competitors. I have outlined the financial assistance that is already available to some of these international competitors. </PARA>

ANL is essentially on its last legs and the government ought to rethink the whole problem because it is an important area. It is in the national interest. The bill before the House does very little to solve the difficulties that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the explanatory memorandum to the bill, one is given a misleading indication of what the bill is supposed to be about. The honourable member for Hume pointed out that the bill is all about a union deal. It is all about the arrangements that were made with the maritime unions on 13 September 1994. It is a bribe on the government's part to bring to an end the national maritime strike over the privatisation of ANL. That strike went for a number of days, tens of millions of dollars were lost, the government capitulated and the result is the bill currently before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at some of the media comment relating to that sordid deal entered into by the government, which is, as we all know, a government of the deals. A couple of days ago in the House we heard about a meeting involving the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Mr Solomon Lew and Mr Lindsay Fox. Of course, the Prime Minister did not come clean and tell us what that deal was about. We do not really know. Ultimately, we will find out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deal entered into by the government was closed on 13 September 1994. In an article by Steve Burrell in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 14 September 1994 headed `Union gun to its head, Govt sinks back under flag,' a few home truths were pointed out. I would like to quote from that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating government would like to pass off its agreement to end the maritime dispute as a wide-ranging package of micro-economic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has, in fact, passed up a great opportunity to achieve genuine and long overdue reforms in Australian shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could have used this damaging confrontation as a catalyst to bring the long-standing problems in the industry to a head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly this would have meant toughing out a long and damaging strike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, faced with the equivalent of a gun held to the economy's head by the maritime unions, it decided that it had no option but to compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the unions (and the local shipping owners) this exercise in brinkmanship has netted a pretty sweet deal.</PARA>
<PARA>The `pretty sweet deal' means that there will be taxpayers' money paid in the first year of an amount of approximately $19 million and the net impact over the next five years to 30 June 2000 could be $59 million after tax. So we have a situation where the taxpayer is, yet again, funding and propping up the shipping industry which, in many respects, has only itself to blame for the difficulties in which it finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the government has rejected a number of recommendations in the Taylor report on reform of the industry. One of those rejected recommendations related to the establishment of a second register of Australian-owned vessels which will be permitted to use foreign crews. In other words, the future of shipping is not very different from its uncompetitive past, slowly sinking under an Australian flag with Australian crews and Australian award conditions. The government will effectively increase the subsidy for international shipping by providing new tax breaks on crew wages and depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 is the legislative instrument through which the government's deal will be implemented. Also, on 14 September 1994 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> had another article under the headline `Canberra goes ANL retentive,' which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE Federal government has bowed to Maritime Union demands offering tax breaks for Australian shipping and ruling out full deregulation of the industry in return for an end to the five-day national waterfront strike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also guaranteed that cheaper foreign vessels and foreign crews will continue to be kept out of the coastal trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the Government acceded to union demands to give its financially troubled shipping line, ANL Ltd, another chance to prove its commercial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all know the sad and sorry history of the proposed sale of ANL. We all know about the infamous comments made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). I think it was in August 1994 when he said, basically, that we could not give away ANL. Yet again this minister is indicating his total, complete and utter incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill currently before the House commits the government to certain steps which are being implemented in the legislation, but the unions only committed themselves to consider negotiating an industrial reform package including further reducing crew size and the crewing factor, changing employment arrangements so that costs matched those under company employment and a long-term wage agreement and reduced training costs. Basically, what they said was, `We will think about these matters' while the government said it would implement this bill. Clearly, the unions have got the better end of the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very interesting diagram in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 14 September 1994 under the heading `Unions win in shipping deal' where it says:</PARA>

<PARA>As we stand today, the other changes the unions agreed to consider have not been implemented. Australian shipping remains uncompetitive. More money continues to be lost and when one looks at some of the employment conditions which used to exist&mdash;two crews per ship and so on, and everyone agrees now that these were unsustainable&mdash;it is no wonder that Australian shipping has been reduced to its current sad and sorry state which is resulting in the industry putting out its hand for more taxpayer funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made a lot of air play of reduction in crewing levels. I concede that there have been some reductions in crewing levels. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) mentioned before that some Australian ships have fewer members of the crew than some overseas ships. He cited the Norwegian example. No-one could deny that Norway is a very efficient shipping nation. Part of the problem is not the number of crew members on a particular ship but rather what they do when they are there. At the present time I am told that crew levels and costs could be tolerated if the crews would perform the same tasks as crews on rival lines. I would like to quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 6 June 1995 which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, Australian crews do not carry out maintenance, such as overhauling engines and scraping off rust while the ship is operating. This means that an ANL ship will spend more time in dry dock than one from a rival line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course you do not need to be a mental genius to appreciate that, when we have that kind of hiccup in the system, ANL is simply not going to be as competitive as overseas shipping lines. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost&mdash;both directly and in lost business&mdash;could run to an extra $1 million . . . for each ANL ship, putting the line at a heavy disadvantage even without considering the customers it loses because services are curtailed. The lack of . . . ongoing maintenance also means that the life of an ANL ship is about 15 years, whereas rivals can stretch theirs to 25 or 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA>When one looks at the capital cost of shipping in Australia, it is clearly a major commercial benefit if an overseas shipping line is able to extend the life of its vessels from 15 years to 25 or 30 years. It is interesting to note the next point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual crew wages only amount to about 3% of ANL's total operating costs, but these other factors blow out to about 9% and really start to wound the line. The cost of the crews is less important than the fact that they don't do enough.</PARA>
<PARA>Japan provides another instance. Some of their manning levels are actually more than the manning levels on Australian ships but those extra people are used to keep the ship shipshape, they are used for ongoing maintenance, they are used in many other ways, whereas I do not know what some of our people on ships do. I do not know whether they play volleyball or whatever. The simple fact of the matter is that we might have fewer people but they do less than overseas seafarers would do, and the result is that Australian shipping is yet again uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the government is coming into the parliament again to seek up to $59 million of taxpayers' money to be given to the shipping industry over the next five years. It has been pointed out that the seafarers will not receive any of this money, and I concede that, but the bottom line is that the taxpayer is funding this. It is another prop-up to an industry which has allowed itself, through varying causes&mdash;partly its own and partly other factors&mdash;to be uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposed for a range of reasons to what the government is seeking to do. We stress that it is wrong for the parliament to give effect to a deal which everyone concedes to be shonky. It is a deal which the government entered into with the unions as the price for the unions abandoning a very costly strike, and the government is asking us, the members of the Commonwealth parliament, in effect to rubber-stamp this deal to give benefits to the shipping industry&mdash;in effect, the government's pay-off to the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, with an election just a few months away, if that, is clearly trying to build bridges with the unions. We know what an important role the unions played in the election of the government during the 1993 election. The government will be talking to unions; the government will be seeking to trade off deals because this government is the government of the shonky deal. The government, through this legislation, is clearly seeking to get a major sector of the trade union movement on side so that the trade union movement, when advertising takes place prior to the election, will give full support to the programs of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum portrays the government as trying to put Australian operators on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs and providing an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to see the Australian shipping industry compete, but really we need to go back to basics. We need to look very much more closely at the major structural problems which prevent the Australian industry from being anywhere near as competitive as it should be. These handouts which the government keeps asking the parliament to approve are no long-term answer to the major difficulties confronting the Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incentive which the government is seeking to have implemented through this legislation is a taxable grant payable to the employers of Australian seafarers on Australian operated ships engaged in international trade. The amount of the grant would be equal to the notional tax payable on the earnings of seafarers serving on that ship. To qualify, a ship must be Australian operated, its crews must be employed by an Australian employer and the ship must spend not less than half its operational service during the year on international voyages. It is interesting to note that some shipping lines are already changing their schedules to try to take advantage of the particular benefits for them included in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, we have about 30 Australian operated ships engaged in international trade and the grant in the first year will be approximately $19 million. The grants are taxable, so that about one-third can be expected to be recouped in 1997-98 because corporation tax payments are lagged by a year. The after-tax impact for each additional ship entering the international trade would be about $400,000 per year. If one ship enters the trade each year, the net impact after tax would be $59 million over the five years to 30 June 2000. I mentioned that if it was possible&mdash;and I believe it is possible&mdash;to have crews on Australian ships doing the variety of work that crews do on ships operating in other countries, we would achieve a benefit of $1 million per ship. Clearly, if that could be attained, it would not be necessary to bring in this legislation which hands a benefit of about $400,000 with respect to each ship involved in international trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is totally opposed to this legislation. We will be voting strongly in the main chamber when this bill is voted on after its return there. We simply will not be a party to this union deal. We will not go along with what the government has sought to do. We do not believe that this is an appropriate response to the very major problems confronting the Australian shipping industry, and the minister stands condemned. In fact, it is a wonder that the government allows this minister to remain as the minister for transport because he has a sad and sorry history of mistakes and being quite inept in so many areas of his portfolio. We do not even see him here in the Main Committee; it is, perhaps, beneath him to come here. But the government has come in here and asked us to approve the allocation of up to $59 million over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government should be doing is looking at the major and ongoing problems which have reduced our shipping industry to the sad and sorry chaos that it is&mdash;a sad and sorry chaos that saw the government knuckle down and saw it run up the white flag when we had the strike last year. We will not accept what the government is seeking to do. We hope that the government reconsiders this matter, because an Australian shipping industry is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipping around this continent is absolutely vital and what we need are policies which will encourage and foster the growth of shipping, whether it be Australian or overseas shipping.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing in this bill before the Main Committee which is going to improve the long-term future of the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, the way that the government, and particularly the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), has dealt with the whole issue of ANL has been an interesting saga&mdash;and a sad and sorry one. The government is in the grips of a massive asset sale program and has been in that position for a number of years. It has not achieved a great deal of success as far as asset reduction is concerned. This bill we are dealing with has a very clear and definite impact on the government's asset sale campaign, particularly with regard to the sale of ANL. It was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 9 May 1995 when the government was in the process of attempting to negotiate the sale of ANL after the Minister for Transport had made his infamous announcement that `you couldn't give it away'. Subsequently, the government flogged off the most profitable part of the ANL group, which was the stevedoring section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole sorry saga, interestingly enough, caused Laura Tingle to write an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> earlier this year. In that article she refers to exactly what we are debating here today in relation to this bill. In that article, headed `Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful', Laura Tingle stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And a small technicality of the "sale" for "$19.5 million" is that, whatever P&amp;O is buying in terms of assets, taxpayers get to keep $183 million in liabilities which the British-owned shipping line doesn't want.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, facing a likely rebuff on the sale, already delayed for four years, by the ALP national conference, Brereton selectively released details of a valuation of ANL which showed it had a negative value&mdash;and which he used to justify his decision to withdraw it from sale.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we all know that behind the scenes of withdrawing it from sale was the Maritime Union of Australia, which was exerting a bit of pressure, as it always does, on the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Labor members&mdash;I think it was the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell)&mdash;stated here a few weeks ago, in the main chamber of the House of Representatives of this parliament, that she was `proud' to be a member of the political wing of the ACTU. That is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. She is a member of the government of Australia&mdash;disgraceful. I go back to Laura Tingle's article. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Soon after this, he rammed through the sale of the shipping line's only decent asset, a 25 per cent interest in Australian Stevedores . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, they sold off the most profitable part of ANL. Interestingly enough, at the end of the article, Ms Tingle noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brereton was in such a hurry to do this that he agreed via mobile phone from a funeral to a deal letting the supposedly financially wrecked ANL lend the money to the buyer without firm security.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of this debate, the important part of this article that Laura Tingle wrote was at the end of article. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what this bill that we are debating today is all about: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for mariners. Who foots that bill? Who covers the cost that the government is asking us all to commit to today? It is the taxpayers of Australia. The taxpayers of Australia have absolutely been bled dry by the mismanagement of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, and in the same article, we saw that the minister spent almost $1 million of taxpayers' funds on the you-beaut pair of whiz-kids&mdash;the mates&mdash;that are supposedly getting ANL out of the mire. They have achieved nothing. The value has gone down. We have not seen a sale. They&mdash;that is, one Mr Turnbull and one Mr Wran&mdash;have been paid their almost $1 million retainer. They have been paid almost $1 million of taxpayers' money to try and salvage ANL, to get it up and running so that we can sell it and get some profit for Australia for the Australian taxpayers. We have seen nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are asked to sign off on a bill that is going to spend almost $20 million a year of taxpayers' money. We must ask the question: on what? It is interesting. What is the purpose of the bill? The purpose of the bill, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest </EMPHASIS>from the library, is to provide for a system of grants&mdash;`grants' is an interesting word to use&mdash;to Australian shipowners who undertake international voyages. According to the explanatory memorandum, the grants will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . place Australian shipowners on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs and provide an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you dig into it a little deeper, what is the money really being spent on? The money is really being spent on the arrangement that was made with the unions earlier this year. In September 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), senior cabinet ministers, the ACTU and the Maritime Union met to negotiate an industry reform package. As a result of those negotiations, Treasurer Willis announced via a press release on 9 May 1995 that the government had agreed to the introduction of a taxable outlays grant&mdash;taxable in the hands of the companies, so that there is company tax payable on it&mdash;to be paid to owners and operators of Australian-registered ships predominantly engaged in international trade, to offset the impact on owners and operators of personal income tax on the earnings of seafarers on Australia's eligible international trading ships. The grant is to be administered by the Department of Transport. Subsidising the PAYE tax that is paid by members of the Maritime Union of Australia is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill goes on to talk about eligibility but, interestingly enough, Australian flag shipping carries only four per cent of Australia's foreign trade, and ANL is not the major carrier of this portion. We are supposedly providing a subsidy, and it is interesting to look at this in terms of the overall public policy direction in which the government is going, as far as subsidies and tariff protection for Australian industry are concerned. Everybody else in this country has had the barriers in front of them torn down by this government. There is no protection. `Get out there on the world stage and become world competitive: no protection for you!' Australia, as a nation in the international marketplace, has led the way in tariff and subsidy reduction, ahead of any signing of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted in some of the information I researched to speak on this bill that the Uruguay Round on free trade and `detariffication' did not get to international transport or international shipping. That was left out. That is all well and good, but this Labor government of Australia has hurtled down the path of `detariffication', pulling down those barriers which are protective walls for a lot of Australian industry. Australian industry has been told, `You get out there and compete and become world competitive!' Here today, we are heading back in the other direction by providing assistance and a subsidy, in a roundabout fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the commentary on the bill says that it is supposed to make our shipping lines more world competitive. But does not that beg the question of why our shipping lines are not world competitive? Everywhere else, we are expected to be world competitive without any assistance, subsidy or tariffs. Why are they not world competitive? The taxpayers of Australia need to ask that question. The bill is born out of a deal with the Maritime Union of Australia, whereby Minister Brereton wanted things to go along quietly while he was trying to sort out his unbelievable mess with the Australian National Line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a buy-off as far as that union was concerned, the minister said he was going to provide a subsidy, supposedly to international shipping. But it is all about keeping the union happy, because that is where it is ending up. It is going to the companies, but it is ending up back with the unions. Fair enough! But let us be fair about the whole thing. We say to our primary producers and manufacturing industries, `Get out there and compete on the world stage, without any assistance from this government.' This is one of the reasons that our primary industries cannot compete: they have had their hands tied by the lack of true micro-economic reform as far as the transport industry is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the decisions that this government has made as far as tearing down those tariff barriers and subsidy mechanisms is concerned. In its haste to be one of the gang and one of the big players on the world market as far as free trade is concerned, Australia has led the way. We have pulled down our tariff levels and then we have gone off and signed up in the Uruguay Round of the GATT to reduce them by a percentage each year, starting from a lower base than everybody else is on. I am yet to be convinced that, in that area, we are ever going to end up on a footing level with some of our competitors around the world, because we are starting low and coming down, while they are starting up high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most salient point is that we are telling all our other industries in Australia to go out and become more efficient, to become more effective, to become better producers and to compete on the world stage, yet we are not asking this industry to compete. We are not asking this industry to have a close look at itself and ask itself why it cannot compete. What are we doing? We are providing the industry with a subsidy which is going to end up back at the level that I spoke of earlier, on the premise that it is going to make this industry more world competitive. Do you know what? It will not. It will not work. It never has. And it never will work, for the same reasons that we have had to make all our primary industries, all our manufacturing industries, cut the fat, get rid of the fat, have a close look at their process and work out why they really are not competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not work there and now those industries are competing, not because of anything the government has done but because they have had a long, hard look at their process and they have found ways and means to become more world competitive. There is a long way to go in that area, where a future government might be able to help them. But this measure by this government will not go anywhere near helping the shipping lines become more world competitive. Of course some of the industry organisations are going to agree. They are getting a handout. That has never helped anybody get off their butt and go and compete and make themselves productive and efficient. It just will not work. History will prove this government wrong in putting this bill before the parliament today and asking us to sign off on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, the opposition is not going to sign off on it. We are going to oppose this bill because it is not right. It is heading in the opposite direction from what this government is expecting of most other industries in this country. On that basis we are going to oppose it. As I say, history will record that this government is heading in the wrong direction and that this sort of measure will not achieve what it is designed to do in helping the shipping industry to be more competitive. The government knows where it has to head to to make Australian shipping more competitive and this is not that direction. I think that it is important that these comments be recorded and that the government be made aware that, as I said before, it is not fooling the people in the press gallery, it is not fooling the people that are informing the people of Australia on what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just repeat the comments of Laura Tingle, because I think they are just a classic. I used this in a speech when we were debating the ANL Sale Bill a couple of weeks ago. I do not know that Laura Tingle is really a great fan of the coalition either, but her headline was, `Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful.' In part of that article she said, `The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners.' That puts it in a nutshell. It is nothing to do with making Australian shipping more competitive. It is a $20 million a year support bill for local mariners, and it is a disgrace. As she said, the behaviour of the Labor Party in flogging the Australian shipping line has been disgraceful. The coalition will oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not hear of opposition members saying to the community that the reform measures activated by this government&mdash;not by a coalition government&mdash;have not had a dramatic impact on crew rates. When the coalition was in government before 1983 and when we came into government in that year the figure was 33. What is it today? Do you know the answer? Eighteen. Do you think that is some improvement? Do you think it might be just a marginal improvement, or do you think it is a dramatic improvement?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, our crew rates are lower. These are by anyone's measure remarkable achievements. I presume that the three opposition members who are in the chamber at the moment have read the bill and the second reading speech. Of the three major components to this bill, the one which seems to have incurred the ire of the opposition concerns the grants that are payable, based on the tax liabilities of seafarers in Australia's international trading ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition would have us believe that somehow this benefit was going to the employees, that a direct financial benefit would accrue to the employees&mdash;the seafarers. Opposition members know that is not true. If there is a benefit, it goes to the shipowners. Listening to opposition members, one would think it was going just to ANL. In fact, they know it is not and that other shipping companies such as BHP Transport will also benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to canvass all of the issues in this debate but, to have some integrity in public life, you could surely accept that, even though you may not agree with everything the government does&mdash;and I do not expect you ever will&mdash;you might at some stage accept that there has been dramatic improvement, dramatic micro-economic reform, in the shipping industry in Australia and that this bill is part of that reform process. If you were genuinely interested in competitive shipping for Australia, you would acknowledge that. But we do not hear any acknowledgment of it; all we hear are disparaging comments about these shipping industry reforms and disparaging comments about the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). Both views are out of order because the shipping industry supports these reforms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to refer them through you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The shadow minister&mdash;who actually lives very close to Canberra, I might say, and not very close to the sea&mdash;needs to be aware that these reforms are supported by the shipping industry. If it is not the waterfront, it is the shipping industry we continue to hear about, which amazes me. We hear opposition members saying there have not been adequate reforms on the waterfront, that we have not improved our competitiveness, that this is not a legitimate process in micro-economic reform. This Labor government&mdash;not a conservative government&mdash;has implemented reforms which are being supported and will be supported in the future by the industry.

You will have noticed I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the reason the minister is not here is that he is in the House debating a bill which has been the cause of some divisions. So I would suggest to the member for Fisher that, before he goes off like a firecracker, he might just deliberate about what he is saying and consider, when he attacks a member of the parliament for not being in a particular place at a particular time, that it is very difficult to be in two places at once.

Surveillance is applied by means of wholesale price caps for sales of petrol and distillate direct to resellers and distributors set by reference to import parity prices. Under what is known as the intervention pricing system, a `landed' cost for fuel is calculated based on import parity prices of bulk ex-refinery petrol and distillate from Singapore. Prices there closely reflect those in other major world petroleum product markets and it is the main source of imports into Australia. The Singapore product prices are adjusted to become import parity or landed prices by the addition of freight from Singapore, wharfage costs in Australia and insurance. As product and freight costs are quoted in US dollars, the value of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the US dollar has an effect in the calculations. Intervention prices for petrol and automotive distillate are calculated daily, based on a seven day rolling average of the latest available Singapore prices.</PARA>
