<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I have just tabled completes an inquiry by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings into future arrangements for the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The context in which the inquiry has been undertaken includes the relatively poor appreciation the Australian community has of Australia's system of government, the significant investment the parliament has made in the production of broadcast quality radio and television signals of the houses and their committees, the current inadequate coverage of proceedings on the electronic media, and the emergence of new technologies which should enable an enhanced coverage of proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this background in mind, the committee has sought in its report to make recommendations that will give the parliament a better strategic oversight of the future of parliamentary broadcasting and enhance the coverage of proceedings at every opportunity. It is recognised that these strategies may not have an immediate impact. The committee's approach is a long-term one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve a better strategic oversight of broadcasting arrangements, the committee recommends that a new act covering parliamentary broadcasting be drafted and introduced into the parliament. The new act would consolidate arrangements for electronic broadcasting of parliament and increase the role of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. In addition to its current role, the joint committee would undertake a more strategic role on behalf of the parliament in advising on arrangements for radio and television broadcasting, regularly reviewing arrangements for radio and television broadcasting, and advising on the application of new technologies to the public dissemination of parliamentary proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee wishes to see an increase in the radio and television coverage of proceedings. One way to achieve this would be to have a service similar to the C-span type service in the United States established in Australia. Such a service would provide dedicated coverage of parliamentary proceedings. The committee will monitor developments in pay television with a view to obtaining channel capacity for the coverage of parliamentary proceedings at the earliest opportunity. Other approaches recommended by the committee to increase coverage of parliamentary proceedings include encouraging and funding the development of packages of parliamentary material for airing on radio and television, and investigating the provision of the audio and audiovisual feed of proceedings to not-for-profit broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the committee I thank David Elder, the Serjeant-at-Arms; our dedicated committee secretary, Mr Bob Morris, who provided expert input into the deliberations of the committee; and my fellow committee members.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That standing order 48A (adjournment and next meeting) and standing order 103 (new business) be suspended for this sitting.</PARA>
<PARA>I foreshadowed that I would be moving this motion and the reasons for it yesterday when I think the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) questioned me on what we would be doing for the rest of the day. This motion is made necessary by the fact that the Senate will be considering a range of our legislation and will be wishing to pass some of it back to us no doubt in amended form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am not necessarily anticipating&mdash;particularly if it becomes apparent later in the day that we will be sitting tomorrow&mdash;that we will go very late tonight, there is the possibility that we might have to. Hence we need to have this particular standing order suspended. I notice the Manager of Opposition Business looking a bit quizzical on that. We need to check with the Senate constantly to see whether or not it is necessary to have a sitting tomorrow. If it becomes patently obvious that that is the case, then I think it is probably smart to adjourn the House earlier than we might have anticipated tonight rather than try to follow the Senate down to 11 o'clock&mdash;which is when it anticipates completing its sitting time tonight. But we need the flexibility anyway. That is why I move the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surprise, surprise. The data on this matter only goes back to 1988. I am told it is difficult to obtain earlier information without a lot of research. I have not sought that further research because, whatever the precedent is, it seems to me that we are quite capable of making a decision on the merits here and now as suits these particular circumstances. For the sake of completeness, in 1993 there were five extended sitting days&mdash;13, 14, 17, 18 and 21 December. On the last three there was no question time but, on the first two&mdash;13 and 14 December&mdash;there was a question time provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have slipped up. I am sure that in the early 1980s we had, as a general rule, a question time on the extra sitting day when that was forced on us by dint of circumstances to complete business, but I do not rest on my own memory. I am not of a mind to seek further research at great public expense when we have one precedent. That is enough for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that we ought to have that question time tomorrow. There is a particular reason for having question time tomorrow. The current account deficit is usually released via the ABS on a Thursday which does give the parliament the opportunity, when it is sitting, to debate its implications for the Australian economy. I do not know why the figure is coming out tomorrow, on Friday, but as we are here and given the expectation that the imports figure will be much higher than had been expected&mdash;and that is one component of tomorrow's figures&mdash;it seems very odd to me that, on the day an economic indicator of great significance to the country is released, we cannot have some questions put to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's current account deficit now is worse than Mexico's. It really is reaching crisis proportions. The Australian public, who basically pay for it through higher interest rates on their mortgages, are entitled to know what the government's reaction is. The Labor government has been in office for 12 years. At the next election it will be seeking a mandate from the Australian people to be in office for 19 out of 26 years. That is the request it will be putting to the Australian people. They are entitled to ask, `What have you done? What results have we had in the 16 years you have been in office?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australia's current account deficit is the highest in the OECD, as predicted by the independent OECD, I think some questions on that subject ought to be answered by the government. It would be nothing but political cowardice for you not to give us question time tomorrow. Now that your sole argument, which is that there is no precedent for question time, has been swept from beneath your feet, I will be very interested to see what your imagination brings forth as the reason why we are not going to have question time tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA>. the implication of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and the provision of office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs. Physical security protection will also be improved. </PARA>
<PARA>The original building which houses the Australian Embassy in Washington was constructed in 1969 with an extension added in 1976. It is now in need of substantial refurbishment. Subject to the normal Public Works Committee process, the government has approved expenditure of $16 million over a two-year period to undertake a comprehensive program of internal refurbishment. </PARA>

In addition, the importance of Australia's bilateral relationship with the United States is better reflected in a major refurbishment rather than selling the premises and moving from a prominent location. The total cost of the proposed refurbishment is estimated at $16 million on November 1994 prices. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It gives me pleasure today to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the results of the committee's review of 1992-93 audit reports, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 337: a focus on accountability</EMPHASIS>. Report 337 reviews 37 reports of the Auditor-General which were tabled in the financial year 1992-93, and is prepared in accordance with section 8(1)(ab) of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 requiring the committee to examine all reports of the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing these reports, the committee has not canvassed in detail all of the issues raised by the Auditor-General, but instead has focused on the key recommendations in his reports. The committee's review has shown that, in the vast majority of cases, agencies have responded positively and promptly to the Auditor-General's recommendations. In some cases, however, it is clear that agencies have disagreed with the recommendations or have not taken appropriate or effective remedial action. It is these cases which are commented upon in report 337. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is in four parts. The first part explains the scope and nature of the committee's review. The second part considers, on a portfolio by portfolio basis, each of the audit reports tabled in 1992-93. The third part considers the various cross-portfolio audit reports presented in 1992-93. The final part gives detailed consideration to a number of the issues raised in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 22 1992-93</EMPHASIS>, Department of Defence, New Submarine Project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 337 contains 15 recommendations for further action by the government. The committee's recommendations address various matters including the need for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to take further steps to reduce the levels of debt associated with the Austudy program, which amounted to $60.3 million in early 1993-94; the need for the Health Insurance Commission to continue to develop and implement strategies aimed at identifying and discouraging Medicare fraud and overservicing, which have the potential to be a significant drain on Commonwealth resources; and, the need for the Joint Coal Board and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to clarify the method of valuing the coal board's future liability for workers compensation insurance, which is in the order of $225 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the audit report on the new submarine project, the committee has taken a forward looking approach. We have not reviewed in detail the nature of the contract for the construction of the submarines, nor have we commented on the rather colourful debates that took place around the time the audit report was tabled. Instead, we have focused on some of the risks facing the project and have considered whether steps can be taken to improve the management of these risks for the remainder of the submarine project and for future defence projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking this approach the committee acknowledges that the Department of Defence has managed many of the risks successfully. For example, evidence to date indicates that the project office has taken responsible steps to ensure that submarine construction and performance standards will be satisfied. Arguably, these are among the most significant of the risks facing the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are areas where project management improvements can be made. Some of the audit findings in relation to financial and scheduling risks, for example, warrant close attention by the department. The committee has made what I believe are a series of constructive recommendations which, if implemented, will help ensure that the submarine project and future defence projects of similar size are managed in an effective and most cost-efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 337 is confirmation that the Public Accounts Committee is committed to ensuring that the reports of the Auditor-General receive close parliamentary attention. By reviewing each audit report that is tabled, the parliament signals to government agencies that the process of accountability and scrutiny is continuous and proceeds beyond the tabling of an audit report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, and on behalf of the committee, I express  our thanks to those people who have contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I also take this opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat for assisting the committee in preparing the report, in particular Laura Gillies, John Carter and Grant Harrison. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I join with the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), to comment on report 337 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A focus on accountability</EMPHASIS>. I am sure honourable members have noted that the committee's reports now have titles. Perhaps in the near future, or possibly in the 38th parliament, the reports will be done in a more interesting colour scheme than the black and red used now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very interesting exercise to review over recent times the Auditor-General's reports. The Auditor-General plays a very important role in watching the expenditure of public funds throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Some of the reports that come through are fairly standard, basic reports that border on mundane, but others are sizeable and have an enormous impact on the outlays of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such report was the Auditor-General's report on the submarine project being conducted by the Australian Submarine Corporation. The Auditor-General was not able to dig into the contractual arrangements and see how the contractor was conducting the contract, but he was certainly able to look into how the Department of Defence negotiated the contract and how it was executed. Some concerns about this project were raised in the audit report. Concerns were also raised when the committee took evidence on the subject and visited the ASC plant in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, the construction and purchase of six new submarines for the Royal Australian Navy represent a significant investment by the government in Australia's defence capability. The project will cost the Commonwealth nearly $5 billion. I think that figure may be closer to $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government hopes to acquire six state-of-the-art submarines. Its other goals are to achieve the capability in Australian industry to support them for 30 years, to achieve a major transfer of technology to Australian industry, to have local involvement in design construction, to have a major saving in expenditure overseas and to have significant export potential as the only useful submarine builder in the region. They were admirable goals that the government set out when it embarked on this project. That is why the contract that was drafted was unique in comparison to other commercial contracts. That was not only due to its size but also due to the in-built possibility of future benefit for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jury is still out on that. We will have to wait until the project is completed and see what benefit an Australian company or a partly Australian company gets from what has been developed so far. My personal belief is that not only the Australian National Audit Office but also this parliament, through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, should maintain a watching brief on the project as it progresses towards completion. One of the important recommendations with regard to the ASC in this report is recommendation No. 7, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future projects of comparable size and nature, the Department of Defence should ensure that contracts contain provisions which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) limit or prohibit the repatriation of dividends until the major project risks have been overcome;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) require careful assessments to be made of the quantum and timing of advance payments; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) allow the Commonwealth to recover advance payments which have not been used in accordance with the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>Due to the nature of the contract and the way payments have been made in sync with the completion of parts of the contract, there is a view that at times the Commonwealth is exposed to unnecessary risk with regard to the completion of the contract and the like. That is why that particular recommendation was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Australian Submarine Corporation was paid too much of the contract price too soon. Some 86 per cent of the contract price had been paid by 31 December 1994. As all members would be aware, to date we have one submarine that is doing sea trials, yet 86 per cent of the contract price has already been paid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shareholders in ASC have received some fairly healthy dividends. ASC has invested money in a 747, which is on lease to Qantas. On that basis, I believe the Commonwealth is bearing too much of the financial risk associated with this project. There is a bit too much exposure. On that basis, in this report we have suggested that the ANAO should maintain a watching brief. Page 167 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the magnitude of the new submarine project, and the fact that much work remains to be done, it would be appropriate for the Australian National Audit Office to revisit the project at a later date. It is likely that any follow-up audit conducted by ANAO would be of interest to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure it will. If I and the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is also taking a keen interest in this particular project, are members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts at the time, we would be keen to revisit this project to see how it goes. In the lifetime of this committee of the parliament we may not see another contract like this. We should draw on the experience of what has happened&mdash;the way this project has been overseen and developed and the conduct of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our public hearings, we were waiting to take evidence from Dr Don Williams, who was the chief executive officer of ASC. We found out a day later that he did not turn up because he had left the Australian Submarine Corporation. Many questions surrounding that surprise resignation of the ASC's chief executive were left unanswered. It raises the question: did he have concerns about the way the contract was being managed? It would be interesting to know what those concerns may have been. Was the ASC becoming too competitive in the Asia-Pacific region for its parent company, Kockums, in Sweden? Did Dr Williams fall or was he pushed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very important questions which are partly addressed in report 337. As the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley, just said, the new submarine project makes up only a quarter of this particular report, but it is a very important element because it contains nearly $6 billion worth of expenditure by the Commonwealth. As I said, the Australian National Audit Office must continue a watching brief on that project. I believe the Joint Committee of Public Accounts should also maintain a watching brief on that project until its completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those short remarks, I commend the report to the House. It has taken a lot of work, particularly by the staff at the secretariat. I thank them for their support and their consideration in dealing with the members of the committee from time to time as well. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am very pleased to speak to this report No. 337 of the Public Accounts Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A focus on accountability</EMPHASIS>. The title sums up the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and also the role of the Auditor-General's office. It is clearly a legitimate role of the Public Accounts Committee to examine Auditor-General's reports. The Auditor-General's office plays a very important role in our democracy and our public sector but there is not much use having an Auditor-General writing lots of fancy reports unless the recommendations are implemented, unless someone takes notice of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the parliament being very important in ensuring that federal agencies and, indeed, governments take notice of recommendations made in Auditor-General's reports and in ensuring that they are implemented as far as possible or certainly considered to ensure that improvements to our administration in whatever agency are made as a result of Auditor-General's reports, which cost a lot of money to produce. The PAC has a very important role in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The particular report that I am interested in is the Auditor-General's report No. 17 of 1992-93, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medifraud and excessive servicing&mdash;Health Insurance Commission</EMPHASIS>. I recall that report was tabled in this House in December 1992. I remember hearing about it on the radio when we were in the middle of the last election campaign. It certainly reminded me of my previous involvement in that issue, which I have spoken about many times in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My introduction to the activities of the Public Accounts Committee was back in 1982, 1983 and 1984 when the PAC was conducting an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. That is why I was quite distressed initially to hear some of the comments in this Auditor-General's report. The report refers to the fact that in the mid-80s the Public Accounts Committee issued a number of reports dealing with fraud and overservicing by medical practitioners and they revealed a number of problems which affected the Commonwealth health budget. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that time, the extent of fraud and overservicing was estimated by the then Department of Health to be `. . . at least 7% of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and health funds'. This figure 7% represented $100m in the 1981/82 financial year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Further on it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pressures on the Medibudget are just as great, if not greater today with the advent of new medical procedures and the growth of entrepreneurial medicine. Today, the same estimate of fraud and overservicing could well still be appropriate. There is no evidence to believe it has changed for the better.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1992. Of even more concern to me and also to the committee, I believe, is that the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the JCPA hearings on fraud and overservicing in the early to middle 1980s, with the exception of the last 12 months or so, there has been little if any improvement in combating fraud and overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly this is a serious issue. If you base that seven per cent figure on annual Medicare benefit schedule expenditure figures in the 1990s, you are looking at something between $300 million and $400 million a year in potential abuse. The report says, and I actually have no reason to doubt what the report says, that there is no evidence that that has improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Public Accounts Committee took some interest in this report, we did have the Health Insurance Commission at a public hearing at which we asked a lot of questions. The results of those questions appear in this report. I will read recommendations Nos 2 and 3 of this report No. 337. Recommendation No. 2 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Commission should continue to develop and implement strategies aimed at identifying and discouraging Medicare fraud and overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office should monitor the performance of the Health Insurance Commission in its efforts to combat Medicare fraud and overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA>They are fairly obvious recommendations to make, but they are fairly important ones. The year of 1985 came after a fairly difficult period&mdash;the introduction of Medicare and a fairly turbulent period in relationships between the Commonwealth government and the AMA. The AMA, of course, changed its position a bit after Medicare came in and after a change of government. It changed its attitude towards the issues of fraud and overservicing and other issues to do with Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an interesting period. We had a doctors dispute in New South Wales and major problems to overcome. One of the ways in which the government sought to overcome them was to transfer the responsibility for combating fraud and overservicing from the health department to the Health Insurance Commission. The Health Insurance Commission was given a specific mandate in 1985 to carry that out. That is why it was of particular concern that in 1992 an Auditor-General's report should say the things I quoted before&mdash;basically, that there has been no improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness to the Health Insurance Commission, I think it is fair to say that the legislation it has had to work with&mdash;the legislation the department of health previously had to work with&mdash;going back 20 years, was not really strong enough  to enable federal agencies to effectively police or combat the abuses of the Medicare schedule or the payment of Medicare benefits. That is why I am quite pleased that the government has passed at least two relevant pieces of legislation in this term of parliament&mdash;the Professional Services Review Act 1993 and the Powers of Investigation Act 1994. There have been subsequent amendments to those acts. I am confident that both of those pieces of legislation are the best attempts yet in terms of legislation to overcome this problem, which is a major drain on the federal budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always supported Medicare. It is the finest health insurance system we have ever had in Australia and it is one of the best in the world. But, of course, it does cost money. Any responsible government, or any politically sensible government, will do whatever it can to ensure that those costs are reduced while not impeding the access and equity to medical services for all Australians. To do that, we have to ensure that the best possible attempt is made to stop abuses by professionals, by medical practitioners or specialists, of the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that now, as a result of reports like the Public Accounts Committee report in the 1980s&mdash;a lot of those recommendations have taken a long time to implement&mdash;and the Auditor-General's report, and as a result of legislation introduced by this government in this term, we might finally be on the way to some real solutions and some real procedures put in place to overcome or to reduce the incidence of abuse of Medicare. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Auditor-General's report was, of course, just one of the reports the PAC report deals with. The PAC has a very important role. I will be keeping a close watch on the performance of the Health Insurance Commission in relation to this particular issue and on its progress for the rest of my time here and subsequent to that as well. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted last night because of the adjournment debate, I was remarking that the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) in his motion before the House had acknowledged that the new work opportunities program is a key element in ensuring that the job compact can be delivered to all eligible job seekers, particularly if they live in areas where employment opportunities are limited. As the government's Working Nation paper points out, there is no doubt that the new work opportunities program will also be the most appropriate employment option to meet the needs of some job seekers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A crucial part of the job compact is the facility for the new work opportunities program to accommodate the concerns, needs and initiatives of local communities. It is very important that the program be regionally organised and managed. This provides an opportunity for local communities to assist the unemployed and for unemployed people to contribute to their communities, as well as business and community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly scope for innovation and flexibility in project design. New work opportunities proposals have also been developed at the national level. These proposals will include jobs to reverse environmental degradation along the lines proposed by Greening Australia, jobs in human services such as personal care of the aged and work based assistance to people with a disability, and jobs as literacy education officers in primary schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this latter matter, I had the privilege several weeks ago to launch the first proposal for literacy education officers in South Australia at the South Australian Institute of Teachers. Trainees for literacy education officers, who were previously unemployed persons, have been allocated to specific primary schools, several of which are in my electorate of Port Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these literacy officers be recognised. One of the great problems with unemployment is the lack of literacy and numeracy skills among some job seekers. Obviously, a child who lacks literacy and numeracy skills grows up to be an adult. Those problems first arise in primary schools. Hopefully, literacy education officers can play some part in addressing those issues for children who have those problems. New work opportunities projects also include specific provision for people with a disability and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, particularly in rural and very remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes remaining, I will briefly refer to the Accord as it relates to the labour market. As both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, have pointed out, the Accord is much more than a labour market instrument; it is also an agent for industrial progress and a vital element of trade policy. The partners of the Accord are committed to both growth and employment as the prime objective of economic policy. The Accord has always been about wage constraint for employment and its success is reflected in two very telling statistics: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income&mdash;20 per cent in per capita terms&mdash;since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the Accord's visions identifies the essential role of training to underwrite long-term competitiveness in addition to improving the life chances of the disadvantaged. But it importantly recognises that skill formation encourages the adoption and the adaptation of new processes and equipment, and is a principal agent of technical change, which is, in turn, a principal agent of productivity on which the nation's prosperity depends. The partners in the Accord believe unemployment represents our greatest social challenge and it is a matter of great satisfaction that the partners in the Accord have met each unemployment goal&mdash;and in this period met it nearly a year early with the addition so far of more than 600,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I again congratulate the member for Lyne, supported by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), for bringing on this debate. It is a bit of a pity that, during their contributions, they both resorted to making negative comments like so many of their colleagues when it comes to employment, education and training matters. Nevertheless, I wish his Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee every success in its 1,000 jobs campaign. Like our campaign in Port Adelaide, I am sure that&mdash;with goodwill, with business and with community organisations, along with the members involved&mdash;they will achieve their laudable goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> By the actions of the member for Lyne and of the member for Cowper prior to framing that motion, both members acknowledge that the initiatives of the government's Working Nation programs are working. There is no doubt about that: you could not frame that motion unless you believed that. Importantly, Working Nation is growing in momentum not only in Australia's cities but also in important areas in regional Australia. It is, of course, a great pity that the bulk of the opposition front bench does not share this important national interest issue as do all government members and, I suspect, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this motion and, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), has said, to congratulate both the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I congratulate the government for allowing this motion to be brought forward so that we can debate what is a very important aspect of community life out there at the moment, and that is the employment and education of our youth and of our work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It used to be that once you had received your education you got employment. Today, there seems to be a great muddle. I think this reflects a lot on the education, the standards and the manner in which education is undertaken in Australia today. The two members have been able to secure the funds. Recognising that they are members of the opposition, I believe this demonstrates that they are prepared to give programs initiated by the government a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a lie to suggest that everything the government does is automatically opposed on this side of the House.

I have no doubt that even though they have suggested&mdash;I do not take offence to it; it is probably a device to get the money&mdash;that the mid-north coast of New South Wales is Australia's holiday coast, I would like to suggest to them that there are other areas in Australia which regard themselves as having good Australian holiday coasts&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I want to mention one in particular, and that is the Whitsunday area of North Queensland and North Queensland in general. But, fair enough, the money is there. The program allows for local involvement. It is always important for governments to understand that, by giving money, they can remove a problem. They cannot do that unless they have local involvement. I believe that partnership is absolutely essential. The credits that both the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper paid for that local involvement were to the people who have looked at it and made submissions with their assistance. I think it reflects creditably on the local population. Perhaps we ought to see more of this around Australia where local people are prepared to be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of course, there will be a profit for the area. If the tourism part of this package gels, the lasting effect will be that people will continue to visit that area and come in and out of the area. Some people, in economic terms, do not understand that if a project is successful there is a multiplier effect. If people continue to visit the area, there will be a chance for these 1,000 people not only over the 26 weeks of the program but into the future. It has a wider implication. So I congratulate those members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this partnership, the government&mdash;and I think it is putting the cart before the horse&mdash;is educating people after they have passed through their educational program. I understand that the program comprises educational training for six weeks out of the whole 26 weeks and the rest of the time is taken up in on-the-job training. As has been said in this debate, it has been acknowledged that, at the end of the 26 weeks, seven out of 10 people will still be unemployed. They will not be long-term unemployed; they will be short-term unemployed. However, we should look at the positive side. We should remember at all times that three out of 10 people&mdash;300 people&mdash;will get permanent jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned that any program the government implements to absorb the unemployed has to have guidelines. There is no doubt that guidelines for past programs have been and guidelines for this program are unnecessarily restrictive and probably deny another sector of the unemployed&mdash;those who have been unemployed for less than 18 months&mdash;an opportunity to get a job even though they might have the skills for it. So, if we look at the class of participants who have been unemployed for 18 months or more, we find that it is restricted. The program does not allow for appropriate skills to be applied to the tasks that could be involved, and for that reason it is a waste&mdash;although we do recognise it as a training program. I understand that, of the 11,700 places that were to be filled nationally by this program, only 8,000 have been filled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is great to have programs that are attuned to assisting high unemployment in certain areas&mdash;and I understand there is above national average unemployment in this area&mdash;but we must look at the effects of programs the government implements on a day-to-day basis to see whether this program is necessary. With Australia as young and as vigorous as it is and with as much opportunity it possesses, the most frightful statistic we have is the underutilisation of our labour resource. This is what it is about&mdash;the unemployed. We have to look at the government's failure to provide the jobs that are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we can even embark on this, we have figures before us that nobody really understands. For instance, we talk about there being 500,000 new jobs, one million new jobs or three million new jobs, but no-one knows where those jobs are. No-one knows what those jobs replace. No-one knows what hours are involved. No-one knows whether they are full-time or part-time jobs. I believe it is fraudulent to present those figures without saying where those jobs are.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are hiding the unemployed. As I understand it, a job can be classified as a job on as little as eight hours a week. In real terms, five people are being absorbed from the unemployment queues whereas only one job is being filled. I understand that, if a person is contributing two hours a week in a paid or voluntary capacity, that person is not described as an unemployed person. Surely that is masking the real problem. If we are going to solve the problem, we need to know what the real problem is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about people absorbed in jobs as a result of programs such as the one we have before us at the moment. Those 8,000 people who will be given a chance as a result of this program will certainly be taken off the long-term unemployed lists but will eventually be placed back on to the short-term unemployed list. Are they jobs or are they not? Are they unemployed or are they not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From speaking to a lot of people in the education area, I know that, in relation to retention levels at school, a lot of youngsters come back to do years 11 and 12 because there is no other outlet for them. Some of them are proving to be a disruptive element for the other students in the broad spectrum of education. I come back to the point that we seem to be looking at this back to front. We should be looking at an education program where we try to teach the skills in the schools, and then after the students have finished university or other education we need to make sure there are jobs available for them to be placed in. I believe the real extent of unemployment and where the real jobs can be provided are being masked. The necessary fundamentals are not yet in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address my remarks to where real jobs, real labour, can be provided: small business. There are many impediments to small business. At a time of a state election in Queensland, it is not uncommon to see small businesses in my area closed. They are closed because of government impositions. For instance, the difficulty employers have today in terminating employment makes them think twice about putting on people. The state's payroll tax has long been acknowledged as an impediment to employment. The super guarantee levy and the fringe benefits tax are add-ons to the impositions on small business to employ. Small businesses have recognised there are many impediments to employing labour, such as high taxes, and they are not employing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A farmer I spoke to the other day can himself maintain a farm which harvests 11,000 tonnes of cane a year. He contracts harvesters, but on a farm which harvests 11,000 tonnes of cane a year he is the only person who needs to be employed for all 12 months of the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is amazing. In my day my father had a 700-tonne to a 1,000-tonne farm. We had a permanent hand and two cane cutters&mdash;and of course dad had a tribe of kids who helped out too. Taking the example of this 11,000-tonne farm, we know society and this government have passed by the needs of small business people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other definite impediment to small business in Queensland providing employment will be the deregulation of shopping hours. It will cause all the little grocery stores and service stores on corners to collapse and allow big international supermarkets to blossom. They will not be good employers. They will not soak up those thrown out of current employment in small businesses. In that regard, I do not think the federal government, or the Queensland government, can claim any credit for creating jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government is closing down railways. Public Service employees on the railways are diminishing in number&mdash;not in just ones and twos but by the thousands. Government services are also being closed down&mdash;this is true for not only the Queensland government but the federal government&mdash;such as those carried out by the CPS, police and the education sector. In my area numbers of post office staff are declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is diminishing the opportunities for employment in small country towns. According to the Local Government Association, these are the areas where work will be provided. Putting the Hilmer measures into effect could be the worst possible scenario for local government, particularly in country areas. We may as well close down the towns if jobs in the railways, the police force, the CPS and a whole multitude of other areas are ripped out of towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of major works projects in Queensland also worries me. They could be great employers. At the moment we have the ridiculous situation where Queensland has a huge coal resource base and powerhouses have been built in the last six years but in the future we will be forced to buy our power from New South Wales. Just think of the job opportunities going to waste. No new dams have been constructed. No programs have been put in place except the user-pays system. Again, these are areas that could provide real labour. No more roads will be built at the public's expense. Roads are now being built in the form of tollways. Many rip through the most beautiful parts of Queensland, particularly in the south. It will be interesting to find out the reaction of Queenslanders in the coming state government election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I talk about tourism because that is what the motion refers to&mdash;jobs on Australia's holiday coast. We have just completed an exercise in the banking, finance and public administration committee looking at the aspects of taxation on the tourism industry that put it at a disadvantage compared with other industries. The user-pays principle that is now coming into tourism, whether it be in regard to the use of the Barrier Reef, the use of a national park or the use of a waterway, is decimating the tourism industry. The government says that it is not putting up or introducing new taxes but there has been an abnormal increase in the aspect of how it funds its money. This is just one way. In regard to fuel tax excise the industry complains bitterly that it is not subject to a rebate because all the fuel it uses on the water is never used on a road back on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax was a particular worry. The committee criticised the government's latest moves in that regard to try to simplify it because they had not gone far enough. Thankfully, the committee did make recommendations both on the payroll tax and the fringe benefits tax. The sales tax was a particular impediment. People in business are being asked to pay sales tax on the equipment they use on a day-to-day basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment opportunities in the health services in Queensland are being diminished day by day. The private hospital system and the private providers are being discouraged from taking up the slack. So, while I again commend the movers of this motion, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper, on their foresight and commend the people of their region for their assistance, I say that the government ought to go back to the fundamentals and look at where these jobs are being lost. It should be honest about where the new jobs are. It should be honest about unemployment and try to form some solution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to answer a couple of things that the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) had to say. The difference between each side of the House can come up in these debates. The term the honourable member used was the `under-resource of our labour force', which is true. On our side of the House we believe that with unemployment comes a great deal of social cost as well. High levels of unemployment disrupt our society greatly and cause great hardship to individuals. I guess that is why the long-term unemployed have been targeted for special assistance with some of the programs this motion deals with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Dawson raised the issue of retention rates. He was missing the point. When we look at retention rates and young people staying at school and endeavouring to gain skills at that level, we find that many of the jobs that the previous generation would have been engaged in have now gone. The jobs are not there. So the best thing those young people can do is to gain further skills to enhance their entry into some of the jobs that are coming on, which require many more skills than probably a 15- or a 16-year-old would have required even in my day and even in your day, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those jobs have gone, so it is not a simple task to say that there should be another system and that those kids should not be at school, that they should be out there working. The jobs that they used to take up are not there any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look deeper into some of the programs that are starting to come into play and some of the policies of this government to encourage school-to-work programs, then I think the honourable member would probably reach a different conclusion. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) moved this motion yesterday in the House. He talked about new work opportunities. He had some criticisms of the programs and  labour market programs generally, but I felt he was missing the point with his criticism that we were targeting the long-term unemployed people who had been out of work for 18 months. The old argument of why we are doing that comes from statistics that show that after each recession or downturn in our economy we pick up people who have been out of work for a longer period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent downturn that we have had caused a high number of people to be out of work for a long period. The problem is that, if you do not get back into the work force in the early months of unemployment, you find it even harder to get back in after you have been out of work for 18 months. Employers do not pick up people who have been out of work for 12 months or more unless those people have a special skill. Employers will pick up somebody who has been out of work for two or three months in front of somebody who has been out of work for 18 months. The government's employment policy is targeted at assisting those people who have been out of work for a long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne talked about whether the employment programs were successful. In Tasmania, 38 per cent of our labour programs resulted in people getting into work. I think that is an excellent statistic, although it could be better. The programs could work towards getting more people into work&mdash;and of course they are doing that. They also get people into the working mode by giving them a six-month opportunity to get back into a job or to get a job for the first time. It enables them to get a pay packet, get into the regular habit of going to and from work and take part in the socialisation associated with that sort of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Working Nation program has been one of the most successful programs in recent times in addressing the problems of the long-term unemployed. I think other countries have looked at that program as well. They are looking at our programs to see how we tackle those issues in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state there have been 6,000 outcomes for job compact clients&mdash;those are the people who are unemployed for 18 months and in receipt of the newstart allowance. That is an excellent start on solving the long-term unemployed problem in Tasmania. We have achieved an overall reduction of approximately five per cent in the total number of people in receipt of social security unemployment benefits&mdash;including the jobsearch and newstart allowances&mdash;and a 5.5 per cent reduction in the number of people on the job compact register in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the program had not been instigated in Tasmania, we would have had no growth in employment. These improvements have occurred in what is still a very difficult labour market, which shows that Working Nation is on track and ahead of schedule in some parts of the state. We have a state government which has not been able to boost job growth at all. All employment has been created by one or another of the federal government programs and can be attributed to the Working Nation initiative. No investment is coming into the state. Our tourist figures are down, and no jobs are being created through the policies of our state government. The only growth in employment in the state is through the new work opportunities program, Working Nation programs and labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a slight problem with the new work opportunities program in Tasmania, with some community concern that it will displace the wages and conditions of other workers. There is some resistance to training wages. I believe that these beliefs and feelings are ill-founded. There is an answer to this, and I am currently working closely with a number of the key players to try to help this program progress further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of many labour market programs that have helped people into training and assisted them back into the work force. Many people in my state have achieved their goal of getting back into the work force, and I can think of several of them. When the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was in Tasmania, Incat, the ferry maker in Hobart, helped people who had been out of work for three years develop the new skill of welding aluminium. That is a high skill and those people were as keen as mustard because they were in a new field that was going to keep their work prospects alive for many years into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programs have also given local government and communities an opportunity to bring forward works that may not have been done for some time, that were just on the list of work that could be done and really needed to be done. Some of those works included developing additional tourism structure and tidying up particular long-term problems, even down to our war memorials. We have restoration work being undertaken on some of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been particularly keen to ensure that the electorate of Lyons has been well represented in making sure that we have achieved what we can from these programs. One such program is the wetlands project, which assisted the local municipality through an innovative program to develop a series of filter ponds for the sewage, and it used jobskills to assist it to achieve its goals. This has now become a first-class tourist feature for the New Norfolk municipality, providing a great visiting and recreation spot. The bird life is establishing there, even the platypi are taking up residence within those ponds that were created through the labour market program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another such program was developed at Chauncy Vale, which had 15 young LEAP people working in a natural sanctuary restoring and preserving the site which was the home of one of Tasmania's great writers, Nan Chauncy. There were a few problems with this, and I think it was caused by the lack of information given to participants when they started. We have now sorted that out. I am sure it will be a very successful program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Orielton Lagoon, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited recently when he was in Tasmania, also had a component of 25 LEAP participants over two stages preparing the wetlands and assisting in restoring the lagoon to get it back to its original state and in getting over some of the really bad environmental problems associated with that lagoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bridgewater High School farm had 15 jobskillers assisting in making the farm into a fine educational tool for training rural workers and also giving work experience in country skills to some of the tough young kids from the urban areas. There is nothing like grooming a cranky bull at 6 a.m. before a show to test the real mettle of some of those youngsters. It gets them to think about who is the strongest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queenstown has 10 jobskills people working on their weeds to wilderness project. The Lachlan River at New Norfolk also has 15 people working on weed removal and restoration of river banks in order to restore that river to some of its past glory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of 23 June 1995, the commencements in Lyons are 257 jobskills and 65 LEAP people. The 53 new work opportunities have been agreed to in principle, and I hope we can get them started very soon. Further places have been created and will be filled in the new financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking for employers who can provide access to ongoing employment once the training period has finished. There are a number of industries in the electorate of Lyons that may well help us reach this goal, including the forestry industry which, with new methods of planting and caring for young trees, requires a lot of manual assistance. It is a good place to learn the essence of the industry literally from the ground up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People now need to have greater skills than they did in the old days. As I mentioned earlier, the timber industry is a far more precise and technical industry today than it was many years ago. You need to know what you are doing and you need to know why you are doing it. Thus job training under jobskills or NETTFORCE would ensure that young people can gain these skills on the job from the professionals while helping an industry deal with a cyclical work demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think members will agree that labour market programs, such as the one mentioned in the motion moved by the member of Lyne, play a significant role in getting people back into the work force in Australia and also adding to their skill levels. I wish those from the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee well in their endeavour to create 1,000 jobs. I am sure that they will achieve that goal. From what the member has said, there seems to be some enthusiasm for achieving that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish other members well in helping people in their electorates get back to work with the help of these labour market programs. I look forward to seeing more successes with this program. I congratulate the minister for developing this program and making it work in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have followed this debate with a great deal of interest because my electorate of Moncrieff has a very high rate of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment and long-term unemployment. I have also followed the new work opportunities program with a great deal of interest. Unfortunately, I was not able to be present when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) visited my electorate to launch the program simply because, as usual, I got only two or three days notice that he was going to do this. Members will understand that it is almost impossible to go to public functions with that sort of notice. That is what happened in my case on that occasion. It was not that I did not want to be there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, whilst I have followed this program with some interest, I am now following it with some concern. I was interested to listen to the speeches other members have made in this debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), and I congratulate him on it. Since the debate started yesterday and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> was available today, I was interested to check the speeches in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see what members said about programs in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the story I have to tell is quite different from the stories that other members have been telling in relation to their electorates. When I was acquainted yesterday with the fact that this motion, quite unexpectedly, would be brought on today, I sought to get some information on the matter so that I could make a contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a member of my staff contact the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I gave him no guidance, so he went through a slightly tortuous process of identifying the right person. I just told him the sort of information I needed. He was referred to the regional office in control of the Gold Coast, which is at Mount Gravatt. When he contacted that DEET office he was told that the person who was responsible for that area was on the telephone and unavailable. He explained that he was seeking general background information and requested, of the staff member he spoke to, the following information, which is what I had requested: how many new work opportunities programs are operating on the Gold Coast&mdash;by that I also meant any plans that might be in hand&mdash;what industries are involved and how many people are currently, or will be, taking advantage of this scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My staff member was told that the person to whom he was speaking did not know but would find out and call back. Shortly afterwards, a Geoff Green telephoned and stated that he had been advised by the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and the department that he could not provide any information. He went on to say that we would have to request this information through the minister's office and that an electoral brief had been prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, my staff member spoke to the DEET office at Southport. Southport is the centre of my electorate and it is also where my electorate office is located. Whilst my electorate has changed a great deal since it was first established in 1984, Southport has always been the core of it. I therefore have a longstanding working relationship with federal government department agencies which are located on the Gold Coast&mdash;and most of them happen to be in Southport. There has never been any problem between me and my office and any government office within my electorate or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the sort of information that was being sought was conveyed to a Sue Horne, who is, I believe, the manager. The same sorts of questions were asked. She indicated to my staff member that the people who had the information were in a meeting and that she would call back with it. She contacted my office shortly after 5 o'clock to say that she could not supply any information without the authority of the area office and that she would attempt to get someone to telephone me with the information required. It would seem that when the people who had the information came out of their office, they told her that this information could not be supplied to me by this office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is quite extraordinary when one considers I am a member of parliament trying to find out what is happening about the long-term unemployed in my own electorate and I keep being fobbed off. This morning the matter was pursued with this Sue Horne, who confirmed that someone would be contacting my office. It was stressed that I needed this fairly quickly because the debate on the subject was scheduled for this morning. A short while after that, a telephone call was received from a Rod Booth, with whom I have a very longstanding working relationship through his senior position in CES. I have always worked very closely and very cooperatively with him, and I have always found him an excellent person to work with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another telephone call a little later, after the sort of information that I wanted was detailed to him, he informed my staff member that he had been instructed that the only way information could be provided to me was through the minister's office. He said that he had discussed it at some length with the area manager but the ruling was firm. He did not say what his conversation was with the area manager. I would hope and trust that he indicated to the area manager&mdash;whom I do not know&mdash;that I am not an irresponsible person when it comes to these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am a member of parliament trying to find out about public moneys being spent within my own electorate. That is what my role is. To end that story, I can say that contact has been made with the minister's office. However, the person who has the information I have been requesting is on three weeks leave. When my staff member indicated that I really needed this information and that I had exhausted every other source, he was told that they would do their best and ring back. As at the time that I came into the chamber&mdash;11.00 a.m.&mdash;no contact had been made with my office by the minister's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I put my name on the speakers list for this item, hoping to talk about what is happening with taxpayers' money under government programs in my electorate, and I come almost empty-handed. Someone may ask: why did I not contact the chairman of the consultative committee? The chairman of the consultative committee from my region is a person called Peter Lawlor. I have known Peter Lawlor for about as long as I have been the member for Moncrieff. I have been in the electorate for 11 years and I have been the member nearly that long. I have no problems with him&mdash;he is a very pleasant fellow and we get on very well. However, he is the Labor candidate for Southport in the forthcoming state election. He is not a businessman&mdash;although I suppose he is in a certain sense&mdash;he is a solicitor, but he is not the sort of person that I would have expected to be chairing the consultative committee on the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may be aware that the Gold Coast is the small business capital of Australia. If you look at all the statistics on employment, self-employment and so on from the Bureau of Statistics, you will find that the electorates of McPherson and Moncrieff have the highest number of self-employed people, or of people employed by a very small enterprise, of all the electorates in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when I make the claim we are the small business capital of Australia I do not do so lightly. It is an area of entrepreneurship. It is at the cutting edge of the Australian economy. Tourism, which is our major industry, is a small business industry. There are few large businesses. People tend to look at enterprises like Conrad International Hotel and Jupiters Casino, see that it is a fairly substantial employer and think that it is typical of the Gold Coast. Those sorts of concerns are absolutely atypical of the Gold Coast. We are a small business economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have expected to have had as chairman someone more in line with the sorts of people we are being told about from other tourism areas. For example, the member for Lyne, who raised this matter, mentioned in his speech that the chairman of his committee is a proprietor of McDonald's Family Restaurants in Taree and Port Macquarie. We have some very successful franchises of McDonald's restaurants on the Gold Coast. There are quite a few of them on the Gold Coast and some people have more than one McDonald's restaurant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that when the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) spoke he indicated that the appointed chairman of his consultative committee was the chairman of a bank in Western Australia. Not too surprisingly the chairman of the committee for the electorate of Page, which is a Labor electorate, is from the North Coast Combined Unions Committee. There is nothing wrong with that. He would probably have a pretty broad experience, although I do not know what his experience of business is. The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) told us that the chairman of his committee was a president of a football club&mdash;he is also a very prominent businessman&mdash;as chairmen of football clubs sometimes are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think members will understand that in an election climate I had some diffidence about contacting a Labor candidate. Peter Lawlor has been the Labor candidate for quite some months, since Christmas in fact. At the moment he is campaigning very hard to defeat a coalition member of the state parliament, Mr Mick Veivers, who is the shadow minister for tourism&mdash;and a very good, hardworking member he has been, too. In that climate alone, it is difficult for me to be contacting him. I say that by way of some explanation. I also wonder whether someone who is a candidate for an election at the time of his appointment&mdash;as far as I know&mdash;as chairman was the appropriate person for the minister to put in this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, there is great goodwill in the community, particularly amongst business people in the community, to do something about the unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our shadow minister indicates that that is his experience. It has certainly been mine. Rotary, for example, has a very high-powered drive&mdash;and has had for some time on the Gold Coast&mdash;for combined Rotary clubs to get their members involved in getting jobs for unemployed people. They have been working very hard at it. They have thrown themselves into it with great enthusiasm and commitment. So the commitment and interest is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is utterly inappropriate that there should be these political overtones attached to the chairmanship of these consultative committees. As I said a few minutes ago, I say this with some diffidence because I know and personally like Peter Lawlor, although I will not be voting for him in the state election. I am sure he does not vote for me either in federal elections&mdash;in fact, I know he does not. For this sort of program to have been put in the hands of a Labor Party candidate was not wise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the experience that I have had in the last 24 hours&mdash;the obfuscation, the run-around, the blocking, the dry gullies, as my office has been trying to find out what is happening in my electorate with taxpayers' money on this&mdash;I am very much inclined to agree with the statements by the member for Goldstein, who has very recently and very properly pointed out the shortfalls in the Working Nation programs and raised the question: is this just another way of fiddling the figures prior to an election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know there is a federal election very imminent. We only disagree on how imminent, whether it is a matter of weeks or months away. All of us who contested the last election remember how the unemployment figures were bodgied by transferring a whole lot of people from unemployment benefits into training programs and the government then saying that meant unemployment had fallen. What it meant was that recipients of unemployment benefits had fallen. However, they had only been transferred to another type of unemployment benefit which was called something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the `don't knows' that I have had and the muddle that appears to have surrounded this particular program seems to be of a piece with the shortfalls that have already occurred in other Working Nation programs. I say that with quite a degree of sorrow. I am pleased that the member for Lyne was able to detail when speaking to his motion the type of cooperation and success that he has encountered in the efforts to reduce unemployment in his electorate. I just wish I had the information to give the House to be able to say the same in relation to Moncrieff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to debate a motion moved by the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), sponsored also by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), on one of the programs under the Working Nation initiative: new work opportunities and use of the area consultative committee process in the mid-coast area. It is also an opportunity to discuss in general, as many speakers have, the question of the operation of Working Nation and the question of, I suppose, the development of initiatives on behalf of government to assist with the question of unemployment, with what can be done from a government perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of government in a practical sense has changed significantly in the last 15 years in relation to job creation. Historically, job creation from government usually meant major public works or increased public sector employment through existing departmental channels. The attempts at assisting private sector employment through government programs were minimal and often inappropriate. As a response to the recession of the early 1980s and the continuing above average levels of unemployment that followed during the recovery&mdash;that is, above average given our postwar experience of the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;the government started to develop a range of programs and subsidy arrangements to assist people to gain skills and to assist business to employ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of these initiatives was mixed for a range of reasons. Firstly, the implementation of some programs proved to be extremely costly, making the unit costs prohibitive. Departmental structures and personnel were often not well equipped to handle problems dealing with long-term unemployed people or with the private sector that would be employing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training and its forerunners were never really designed for the task they have faced over the last 15 years. The massive increase in unemployment levels led to increased resourcing for the department, but real difficulties have continued with respect to having the right structure to respond to the challenges faced, the ability to react quickly and with innovation to changing demands, and getting enough of the right sort of staff to perform the various roles required. For example, working with small business people and convincing them of the scope available for assistance via government programs is not a role many public servants would be comfortable with. Administrative competence comes secondary to role of advocate and salesperson on these occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector also had a general suspicion of government. By that I mean that many business people, particularly in small business, were unwilling to believe that the government could actually be there to help them. Visions of bureaucracy, red tape and armies of clerks and accountants were difficult to overcome in terms of convincing employers that real practical assistance was available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some programs just were not successful or, rather, not as successful as was hoped when dealing with diverse areas of labour market demand, both in terms of the opportunity for sustainable employment growth and also regarding the skills required. Government has found it difficult to accurately predict and anticipate regional needs and provide appropriate program delivery. The role and interaction between the three levels of government have also been problematic with respect to some programs. Parochialism and political partisanship have at times hampered practical policy outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of these difficulties can also be related to the problem of developing policy nationally for implementation locally. By that I mean that any employment generation policy that seeks to practically influence diverse local labour markets has to be able to not only appeal to the vagaries of a particular area but also understand the psychology of the various players involved; for example, prospective employers, the unemployed and the various bureaucrats at state, federal and local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s and early 1990s have seen various initiatives being tried with some being discarded and others refined. The government's white paper, Working Nation, essentially builds on the experience of the last few years. In terms of labour market programs and the role they can play in job creation, the emphasis is on subsidy support for employers to employ. This occurs via traineeships with the continuation of jobstart and also under the job compact with the new work opportunities program. The nature of these programs is to encourage employers to employ, to give them an opportunity to turn a marginal job opportunity into an ongoing position via government subsidy. The subsidy provided assists while a new employee is being trained and helps minimise the economic cost to business of employing new staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts are also being made to assist the unemployed to establish their own businesses under the new enterprise incentive scheme, known as NEIS. Under NEIS, managing agents accredit training in small business management and planning skills. Participants also receive business advice, mentoring and an allowance during the critical first year of establishing their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis on improved training programs and practical on-the-job training seeks to ensure potential employees have relevant skills in terms of labour market opportunities that are available. This has always been the aim with training programs. However, with better business links, improved coordination, greater flexibility around what courses are available&mdash;when they are available&mdash;and how quickly they can be developed, better outcomes are expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important themes in Working Nation in terms of its practical initiatives is its localism. By that, I mean the consistent approach of trying to structurally address the difficulties faced by national policy being implemented at the local level. For an employment generation policy to be successful, it has to be adaptable to local circumstances and be capable of implementation by those responsible. The government is doing this in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the government is doing this through the co-option of industry and union representation at all levels. This occurs through national bodies, such as NETTFORCE; through industry related activities, such as industry training boards; and at a local level, via DEET area consultative committees and the boards of regional development organisations. The intention is to ensure that initiatives are implemented with broad support because there is broad agreement on their appropriateness. This will help to make sure that initiatives are successful and, hopefully, undermine the suspicion of government's role at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts are also being made to improve the service delivery options available to government. The CES is being revamped, with an increased emphasis on outcomes through the individual case management approach for the unemployed. This should help ensure unemployed people get better, more effective advice and assistance with respect to appropriate training and job opportunities. In addition, private sector providers are also being introduced to provide case management services. This will provide an alternative to the CES and is already placing pressure on CES staff to improve their game. Area consultative committees should also assist CES management to be better in touch with the needs of the area they serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One initiative that I believe could be very successful is the use of CES officers to lobby local employers to put people on. Although the CES currently has business service centres whose role is to perform this task, they tend to concentrate on larger employers. By dedicating staff to knock on doors and convince employers that they can afford to employ someone, I am confident that many small employers can be convinced, and the net increase in employment could be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the strategy I have briefly outlined is difficult to quantify accurately, but the available information is encouraging. For example, the success of NEIS is demonstrated by the fact that 84 per cent of NEIS participants are still in employment 15 months after starting their NEIS businesses. NEIS businesses also create jobs by employing additional people. For those on traineeships, the retention rate in unsubsidised employment is 84 per cent some three months after the subsidy period is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also possible to compare the success of labour market programs for participants with the circumstances faced by those who have not taken part in any program. Evaluations of jobstart, job clubs, jobtrain and skillshare, which accounted for about 75 per cent of all labour market program commencements in 1994, showed that they greatly improve the chances of getting a job. Participation in a training program increased the likelihood of getting a job by 50 per cent, while participation in a wage subsidy program doubled the chance of getting a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the programs have had an even greater impact on the job prospects of the long-term unemployed. For example, for jobstart people who had been unemployed for 12 to 24 months, there was a 60 per cent outcome rate; but for people not in jobstart who had been unemployed for 12 to 24 months there was only a 27 per cent outcome rate. Preliminary data on former jobstart participants shows that outcome levels for the long-term unemployed are sustained for at least a year after program participation. However, I believe that the development of a comprehensive and effective system is an ongoing process&mdash;and that process is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their speeches on this motion, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper congratulated and recognised the work of the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee. The member for Lyne though was keen to make clear that his congratulations and recognition were an endorsement of the local area committee's work rather than an overall endorsement of the program. In his speech yesterday the member for Lyne said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this motion is not a ringing endorsement of this particular government program but a recognition of local people being innovative and entrepreneurial in an attempt to strengthen a major local industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The jobs program, which this group of regional leaders has put in place, has the unqualified endorsement of business and community groups throughout the region, as the motion says.</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, what has happened in the mid-coast area is what is happening all over Australia through this program. In the debate on this motion we have had the Mid-Coast ACC mentioned by the members for Lyne and Cowper; the Perth Area Consultative Committee was mentioned by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith); the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) pointed out yesterday that he thought the Gold Coast ACC was `on the right track', although there were some concerns raised about who might be the chairman; the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) talked about the Northern Rivers ACC and the work it was doing towards job creation in that area; and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) spoke in some detail about the development of worthwhile programs in the Port Adelaide area. So examples in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia were raised through the debate in this House. They are part of some 60 area committees that are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You just cannot drop them on the ground and get them going. Obviously, it takes time to get them to work properly and successfully. It is occurring all over the country on a regular basis and the improvements are there in the statistics for us to see. Members of parliament from both sides are recognising that those programs are successful in their areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government's overall target in Working Nation is to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. We still have a long way to go. As someone who has been unemployed in years gone by, during the last recession, I know that it is difficult for people who are in that situation to see that there is a chance in the future. Since the release of Working Nation we have seen the rate of unemployment drop from a peak of 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also have to look at what Working Nation is about and what the role of area consultative committees is. It is a question  not only of generating employment but also of ensuring that we do not have a situation that occurred in previous recessions where the long-term unemployed were left behind. If you look at the last recession and the recovery that came after that, you will see that with employment growth there was minor impact on the number of long-term unemployed. If, say, 430,000 people went back into employment, only 10,000 or 12,000 were long-term unemployed, because they were left behind. The circumstances resulting from this recovery are very different. Now about 25 per cent of the new jobs created have gone to the long-term unemployed. That is a major endorsement of the rationale and the strategy behind this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen a major drop in the number of long-term unemployed youth&mdash;an issue close to my heart&mdash;of close to 30 per cent over this period. Again, that is an area that is a key to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are debating this issue we also have to look at the coalition's record in these circumstances. The recent headland speech from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made no mention of employment, education and training. Even The Things That Matter farce that occurred some months ago had a whole chapter devoted to that, but it has now dropped off the agenda. In the last two years, we have created over 600,000 new jobs through the government's policies and through the overall economic recovery. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer in the coalition government, the record was 262,000 jobs created in 5 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A big part of it all is productivity improvement, which also has an impact on the economy in an overall sense. We have had four per cent productivity improvement in the labour force, while the best the coalition achieved when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 1 1/2 per cent. There are clear differences there for all to see. Although it is some years ago&mdash;and that is often the point made by the opposition&mdash;the fact is that it is the only record we have on which to judge the performance of the Leader of the Opposition, because for so many years he has been isolated from real power, even within his own party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of area consultative committees, we are also talking about the issue of regional development&mdash;that localism that I mentioned earlier&mdash;how you develop a real local identity, process and energy to develop agreements on a local basis. Yesterday the member for Page talked about the memo that was produced by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) on the question of regional and rural development. It was very insightful of the actual process being followed by the coalition. He talked about the need to have big figures and the need to try to set an agenda which was based on statements rather than on action. He stressed the fact that, after an election, one can always back away from it. The government's policies have been endorsed by the OECD. The minister has spoken about that on a regular basis. The situation we have here is that we are doing something. It is working and it should be commended by the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to debate the topic of a republic. It is a topic more relevant to our children and the generations to follow than to us. For that matter, notwithstanding our respect for and consideration of the views of our older Australians, we must bear in mind that the decisions we make regarding the constitution will be for our younger Australians, and our decisions should be in their interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite being a young nation, Australia has a long and proud history. Since Federation in 1901, we have endured, among other things, two world wars and a depression. In spite of this, our nation has remained a united and free democracy, the envy of many nations throughout the world. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) pointed out in his reply to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been one of fewer than 10 countries that has been continuously democratic for the whole of the 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be denied that our stability is due, in part, to our stable constitution. Our constitution has rewarded our nation with continuous democracy, freedom for our people and stable government for our nation. However, I should point out that stable government does not give us honest government, and the members opposite are a testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's statement outlined his republican agenda. He tried to give the impression that his statement was based on the recommendations of the very expensive Republic Advisory Committee, but the speech we heard from the Prime Minister was his republican agenda, and his alone. In April 1993, the government established a Republic Advisory Committee headed by Malcolm Turnbull. It was made up of an elite group chosen by the Prime Minister and, I should add, it was a group certainly not representative of mainstream Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that, when the Leader of the Opposition announced that the coalition would allow the Australian people to be involved in the process of constitutional reform and that we would hold a people's convention&mdash;the make-up of which would be 50 per cent appointed and 50 per cent elected, and 10 per cent of those appointed would be in the age bracket of 18 to 25&mdash;the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) questioned the fact that we would appoint half the membership. He questioned the fact that half the people's convention would be appointed; yet the Prime Minister's advisory committee was 100 per cent appointed, unrepresentative of mainstream Australia and lacking in representation of young people. The question must be asked: did the member for McEwen question the Prime Minister about his appointing the whole of the Republic Advisory Committee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech, the Prime Minister outlined his republican agenda. The major characteristics of the Prime Minister's plan are for Australia's head of state to be appointed by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of both houses of parliament; that that person is nominated by the Prime Minister after consultations with the opposition; that the head of state has the same powers as the Governor-General&mdash;however, those powers will not be codified&mdash;and, finally, that no serving or former politicians are eligible to become head of state until five years have passed since their departure from parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One characteristic of the republic debate is that the Prime Minister seems to think that this debate is about whether we want an Australian as head of state. He gives the impression that anyone who supports the present constitution is a lesser Australian than he. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Many supporters of the present constitution fought for our nation, risked their lives for our nation, and if the Prime Minister is going to suggest that he is a better Australian than they simply because he wants an Australian head of state then he ought to think again. This debate is not about whether we want an Australian as a head of state. If we were writing the constitution today, it would be inevitable&mdash;probably the first point&mdash;that Australia's head of state be Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, though, that we are debating a constitution that was prepared last century, we are dealing with the complexities of change that are associated with that constitution which was written all those years ago, and therefore the topic of debate is not how do we just delete any references to the Queen but, if the Australian people are not adverse to changing the constitution to deleting references to the Queen and her heirs and successors, how do we find out if that is what they want and, if it is what they want, how we do it while giving them the same or better certainty, stability and freedom that exists with our present constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, it should also be remembered that over the past 30 years the Governor-General has become Australia's constitutional head of state. That position has been occupied by an Australian since 1965. I cannot foresee any future government, so long as we have the Governor-General, appointing anyone other than an Australian to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, and I note various elements of the media also, have condemned the coalition for advocating a people's convention. I take exception to their criticism. Firstly, the government's Republic Advisory Committee, on which the government's position is based, does not represent mainstream Australia. A people's convention will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government Republic Advisory Committee only looked at the minimalist approach of constitutional change. It did not, as the Leader of the Opposition said, consider items such as the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted; whether we should introduce four-year terms of the parliament; and the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between state and federal governments, including areas of overlap and duplication. These are issues which are pertinent to Australia becoming a republic and which were ignored by the Keating committee but which will not be ignored by a people's convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a people's convention will ensure that if the people want constitutional change then the constitutional changes which are proposed will be those decided by the people and not the Prime Minister, his office, the Keating committee or the Australian republican movement. The Keating committee was expensive, considering it was a smokescreen. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were expended by the government on the Keating committee, and there is little evidence from the Prime Minister's statement of him taking note of their recommendations. For all we know, the statement could have been prepared before the committee commenced any deliberations but only made by the Prime Minister afterwards. A people's convention will give the people the constitution they want, not the constitution the Prime Minister demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic Advisory Committee is hardly a people's convention. Look at the 22 public forums it held around the nation. In a population of 18 1/2 million people, a mere 1,479 persons attended the public forums held by the Republic Advisory Committee. That is an average of 67 people per meeting&mdash;hardly representative of mainstream Australia. Because I truly want to hear the people's view, I organised a public forum within my own electorate of Stirling. We had an attendance of 200&mdash;three times the average attendance the Keating committee could manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A people's convention will ensure the will of the people shall prevail. The Prime Minister wants a referendum on his proposal, not the people's&mdash;and that is the only question that will be put at a Keating referendum. Looking at all the referenda held in our nation, one thing is perfectly clear: referendum proposals will only get through with bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not support the Keating proposals until there has been further, more detailed consultation with the public. Our view is&mdash;and this is what we will do when we win government&mdash;that a people's convention should be held to debate the various aspects of the constitution and what changes, if any, should be made. That way, if there is a strong consensus for change, we know that the referendum question put to the people will be supported because it will be their referendum proposal, not the proposal of a megalomaniac sitting in isolated imperial renaissance splendour in the Lodge here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our approach keeps the people involved at the beginning, at the middle and at the end. It lets them debate the constitution the whole way through&mdash;not after the Prime Minister has put forward his proposal at the beginning and said, `This is what I'm offering you. It is that or nothing.' If there is not general consensus from a people's convention, the various options which were preferred at a people's convention is what will be offered, including the status quo which many in the community may want. Presently, if the Prime Minister had his way and put forward his proposal and it was rejected, there would not be any constitutional debate for many years under the guise that the public have recently considered the topic and do not support another debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message to the Prime Minister, therefore, is: if you really want to change our constitutional head of state, allow the people to decide the approach we take to doing this, from the beginning to the end. If you try having your way, it will be rejected. The Prime Minister does not want the proposed new head of state's powers codified. The thing is that the people might. In fact, I am sure the people would. If we take the Keating approach, the opportunity of considering codifying the head of state's powers and how that would be done will not be presented because we are having only the Prime Minister's agenda followed and not the people's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating probably the most significant and historic change to our constitution, indeed to any law, in Australia's history. The changes we are debating seek to change our constitution and, for that matter, the running of government. The great thing about our present constitution, to the credit of our forefathers who wrote it, is that changing the constitution requires the support of the majority of Australians in a majority of states. Therefore, for Australia to become a republic, we need the support of the people. That will come about only by involving them in the process of change, from the beginning to the end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's proposals are only his. A people's convention will put forward the proposals of the people for the people to vote on. It will ensure any referendum which arises from that carries bipartisan support, ensuring the referendum has maximum support and ensuring that, if we do change our constitution, it is the people's changes that are made. I will support only constitutional changes that carry the support of the majority of Australians after they have had the opportunity to consider all options throughout the whole debate, and that can be done only through a people's convention as proposed by the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to the contribution by the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) to this debate. In the interests of the good order of the House, I exercised great restraint during some of the comments he made. One needs to take up a few of the points the member for Stirling and I know many of his colleagues are running in this debate. First, the member for Stirling, like all of his coalition colleagues, keeps trying to avoid the fundamental question&mdash;a question that has been asked of those opposite for quite a while now and which the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has failed to answer and continues to fail to answer: does the coalition believe that an Australian should be our head of state? That is the question opposition members must answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we on this side of the House do believe that. We believe that an Australian should be our head of state, that we are an independent nation entitled to have our own head of state from our own people. That has been the essence of the debate on the republic since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) first raised the issue in 1991, and that is the question the coalition continues to refuse to answer. No amount of obfuscation, delaying tactics and avoidance rhetoric by the member for Stirling, the Leader of the Opposition or any of their colleagues on the opposition benches will hide the fact that the people of Australia are asking for an answer to that fundamental question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt to hide from the question by saying that Australia has been selecting its own governors-general for the last 30 or 40 years and that they have been Australians&mdash;most of them have been outstanding Australians and have done the job very well&mdash;does not answer the question. The Governor-General is not our head of state; the Governor-General is the representative of our head of state. According to our constitution, the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, and her children and grandchildren will hold the position as our head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, as a democrat, believe that we the people should choose our head of state and that no-one should have a right to be our head of state because of the family they were born to or who their parents are. I fundamentally reject the concept of a monarchy because I am a very strong democrat and I believe the people should choose our leader and our head of state. I believe fundamentally that the people of Australia, when they get the opportunity to directly participate by voting in the referendum that will be held in 1998 or 1999, will make that decision as well. They will show they believe in having an Australian as our head of state. </PARA>

Is he the head of state or not the head of state? By our constitution, no, he is not. He is not the head of state. He is the representative of the head of state. It is something of great confusion. You just have to ask the Governor-General yourself and he will tell you that. When the Governor-General has travelled in Asia and in other places around the world they are unsure what his actual status is because he is not really our head of state. He is doing a great job as Governor-General. He is an outstanding Australian and I have the utmost regard for his work and the opportunities that he has advanced for Australia in his work as Governor-General, but he is not there in his own right.

That is the challenge that the member for Moore has to answer, and that is the challenge for all members of the coalition, his former colleagues, who treated him in such a dastardly way by dumping him for preselection. It will be interesting to see whether he has the courage now as an independent member of this parliament to be truly independent and to say, `Yes, I agree an Australian should be our head of state.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has attempted to confuse the question by pulling the stunt which he pulled out of the former opposition leader's bag of tricks called a people's convention. He is saying, `We will have this people's convention and that will be the most democratic way that we can determine the process of reforming our constitution.' Let us look at the question of the people's convention because the member for Stirling was raving on that this will be the will of the people; that this will be an expression of the views of the people. I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, but 400 members out of a population of 18 million does not to me represent necessarily the will of the people any more than this parliament represents the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament is a far more democratic process for representation of the will of the people than the people's convention will be because the Leader of the Opposition intends to appoint half the members of the people's convention, whereas all the members in the House of Representatives and the Senate are elected by the people of Australia each three years, or each six years for the senators. So they actually do truly represent the will of the people. We are here to express the views on behalf of our constituents in our electorates. The parliament is the appropriate place to have the debate about what form the referendum should take and whether or not we should move forward with constitutional reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we had to have people's conventions in the 1890s was that we did not have a national parliament. We did not have a properly constituted national body representing the will of the people to go through the process of debating a constitution. It did not exist. That is what the people's convention was about&mdash;creating those structures and forms to enable the democratic will of the people to be expressed continuously over the next few centuries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need a people's convention. We certainly do not need a people's convention which is half appointed by the member for Bennelong, should he become Prime Minister. That would not represent the democratic will of the people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people will have ample opportunity&mdash;and I hope they will partake of all the opportunities over the next few years&mdash;to participate in the debate on this question. This is not about Keating's republic, as the obsessionists&mdash;led by the member for Stirling&mdash;try to make out. Opposition members are absolutely obsessed with one man rather than with talking about the issue. They constantly attempt to move away from the real issues that are under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No amount of name calling or grand description of the Prime Minister in those colourful phrases that the member for Stirling uses is going to hide the fact that the question of the republic is the issue that we are on about&mdash;the question of whether or not we want an Australian as our head of state to take us forward into the 20th century as a truly independent nation. That is the issue that the people of Australia will be talking about. We will give them that opportunity through a referendum, which is the most democratic way the will of the people can be expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our constitution makes it very clear that we need a majority of Australians to express that view. It is not going to be decided by a very narrow result&mdash;such as 50 per cent plus one&mdash;because our constitution says that we need a majority of people in a majority of states to have a successful referendum. That ensures that, to decide a referendum question, a clear majority of all Australians needs to make the same decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have yet to have anybody tell me why we need this people's convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been some considerable public discussion about the recommendation in the Prime Minister's statement on the republic that the president should be elected by the parliament, not by a direct election involving all the people of Australia. Some people have confused the issue by saying, `Why should politicians pick one of their own or one of their mates to be the president? We the people want to make the decision.' On the other hand, they are saying, `We certainly do not want a politician as our president. We want somebody who is a great leader, somebody who attracts widespread support across the whole spectrum of society.' We on this side of the House definitely want that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to go through the process of having a political campaign to select the president, but that is what we will have if we have direct elections.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure you that, if we have a popularly elected president, the Labor Party would put up a candidate, the National Party would probably put up a candidate, the Liberal Party would want to put up a candidate, so too would the Greens and the Democrats. We would have five, six or eight candidates running around the country spending tens of millions of dollars bombarding people in their newspapers and on their televisions, saying, `Please elect me for president.' Having that type of campaign would be the most divisive way we could ever select a president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to go down that path, it would totally undermine the fundamental structure of our parliamentary system of government. It would be totally anathema to the Westminster system that we have in this parliament&mdash;which says that the parliament is paramount, the Prime Minister and the government are accountable to the parliament, and the parliament, through the election process, represents the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a fully publicly elected president, who has his or her own mandate, barnstorming the country saying, `If I'm president, I will do this and this,' we will have a divisive campaign with people having to choose between whatever party's candidate they want for president. Once we have elected a president, we will have this individual with a mandate he or she has gained through that popular election. The Prime Minister and the government in the two chambers of the parliament will have their own mandate because they would have been elected at a different time.

It is vital that this side of the House inject some commonsense and perspective into this discussion about the future of Australia's constitution. It is equally important that the debate is not hijacked by those, such as the Prime Minister, who are pushing the republic for their own selfish, political objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not lose sight of the real issues and how well the existing constitution has served us up until now. The overwhelming issue is what system of government will best deliver a united, stable and tolerant Australian nation. It is also about what constitutional arrangements Australians feel most comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House recognise that attitudes in the Australian community are changing, and that attitudes towards the constitutional monarchy are different from those which existed 30 or 40 years ago. If change is to occur, it is important that it occurs in a united, not a divided, fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that if the Australian people reject change the issue is not allowed to fester and to detract from the matters that should really concern this nation such as the economy, our standard of living and the future opportunities for the next generation of Australians. It is also important that any change occurs for the right reasons. In this context, many of the arguments put forward by the Prime Minister do not pass the credibility test. The suggestion that our Asian neighbours are less likely to respect us, or to even trade with us, because of our constitutional system, demeans our trading partners and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the Prime Minister suffers from constitutional cringe. That is his problem, not the nation's problem. Similarly, the Prime Minister is mistaken, or just downright disingenuous, when he implies that the vast majority of Australians who want to retain the monarchy do so because they want to retain constitutional ties with Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This demonstrates that the Prime Minister has no understanding of the role the monarchy has played in Australia's constitutional system and its traditions. Many generations of Australians have respected and cherished the role that the constitutional monarch has played in their daily lives and those of their ancestors. This has provided a role model for the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister is really concerned, as he pretends, about Australia's independence, he would do something about our critical balance of payments situation. There are many people who believe that, no matter what our constitutional set-up, Australia cannot see itself as truly independent if it continues to labour under its enormous level of foreign debt, which is currently in excess of $160 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the outrageous situation where the Australian democracy continues to be overridden by international treaties, which automatically become part of Australian law and have been used in that manner. This is a far greater threat to our independence than the Australian constitutional monarchy, which has, in fact, helped to guarantee the freedoms that we take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is also wrong in his criticism of the origins of the constitution. In July 1993, in his speech to commemorate the centenary of the Corowa conference, the Prime Minister described the constitution as `complex, legalistic and virtually impossible to relate to contemporary Australian life'. This is simply not true. The Australian constitution continues to provide the nation with an effective system of governance&mdash;a system that the Australian people are remarkably reluctant to tamper with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are problems, they result from the inability of politicians to agree on solutions to problems such as the imbalance in revenue raising and spending powers and on where specific functions should lie. The Prime Minister went on to say that the constitution `was framed as a routine piece of 19th century British imperial legislation'. In July 1994, he told a group of school children that the constitution was designed by the British foreign office to look over the Australian government's shoulder. The Prime Minister is not even averse to misleading school children on this issue. What he told them is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can do no better than to refer to the opinion of Ms Anne Twomey, the author of the Parliamentary Research Service publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The constitution: 19th century colonial office document or a people's constitution?</EMPHASIS>. In this publication she wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Colonial Office did exert some influence on the Constitution, it is still the case that almost all the Constitution was written in Australia, by Australians and for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We have learnt to expect no better from the Prime Minister. His knowledge of Australian history has proven time and time again to be defective. Have we ever heard him say that the constitution has served us well? I challenge those on the other side of the House to tell us when he has said that the constitution has served us well. I do not think they could find a single instance when he has said that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has the constitution ever failed to deliver us stable government, a safe democracy for all and a cohesive federation of states? The main  test  for  a constitutional  system  is whether it promotes democracy. The Australian system passes this test with flying colours. We have witnessed 95 years of freedom, political stability, cohesion and tolerance that other countries envy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A nation should not tamper lightly with this remarkable heritage. It is tragic that the Prime Minister has tried to use the republican debate for his own political purposes. Only he could turn a constitutional debate into a point scoring exercise. The Prime Minister has misled the Australian people about the difficulties inherent in moving to a republican system. According to him, this momentous step can be taken by changing a few words in the constitution. This is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eminent constitutional lawyers of the calibre of Sir Robert Garran, H. B. Higgins, Professor Geoffrey Sawer and Professor Colin Howard have raised grave doubts about whether a referendum under section 128 of the constitution can create a republic. The constitution is itself clause 9 of an imperial enactment, the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. While clause 9&mdash;that is, the constitution&mdash;can be amended by referendum, the other clauses in this act, which envisage the continuation of the monarchy, may not be amenable to amendment in this manner. This includes the preamble to the act, which refers to the agreement of the people of the various colonies to unite in one indissoluble federal Commonwealth under the Crown. In the past, these covering clauses could probably have been amended by an act of the United Kingdom parliament. However, quite properly, this possibility was removed with the passage of the Australia Act in 1986 by the United Kingdom and the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this legislation appears to be that all state parliaments will be required to agree with any proposal for a republic. The difficulties of securing this agreement should not be overestimated. Another issue is the possibility that some states might choose to retain their monarchies. Each state has a separate crown, legislature and judiciary. Each state constitution is preserved by section 106 of the Australian constitution. The Australia Act preserves the monarchical system of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some state constitutions have provisions designed to make changing them very difficult. For example, Victoria requires an absolute majority in both Houses, Queensland requires a referendum, and Western Australia requires both of these. Under the Prime Minister's preferred model, it is up to each state to decide how it would appoint its head of state. The prospect that Australia might end up a federal republic with one or more of the states continuing links with the monarchy  is not an outcome that would be in the overall interest of the Australian nation. Nevertheless, it is one that the Prime Minister appears comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has underestimated all of these obstacles to change. He has also taken for granted that, if we were to have a republic, Australians would support his preferred option of parliamentary election of a President. On this, like so many matters relating to the republic, his position is badly flawed. In the latest poll, 74 per cent of Australians support popular election of a head of state, while only 16 per cent support the Keating model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Australians who are assessing for themselves the merit of Australia moving to a new constitutional framework are affronted at the shallowness and insincerity of many of the Prime Minister's arguments. Quite obviously, much of his rhetoric about the reasons for change are just wrong. The coalition does, however, recognise that many Australians are attracted to the idea of a republic&mdash;most of them not for the reasons put forward by the Prime Minister. To enable the issue to be addressed by the people for the people, the coalition in government will establish a people's constitutional convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a consensus emerges from the convention, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a referendum. If no consensus emerges, the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for constitutional change to establish which of them they desire. These options will include electing the president by popular vote or by parliamentary vote, or any other method of election that emerges from the discussion process. The option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's first priority in pushing the republican cause is to cement his place in history. However, the partisan and ingenuous way in which he has handled this issue will only cement his reputation as the most divisive Prime Minister in this nation's history. If the Prime Minister were really interested in fostering a national consensus on the question of the republic, he would immediately stop tampering with the symbols of our current system of government. Many of these, while the Labor Party has been in power, have been fiddled with to the direct detriment of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to make a contribution to the statement by the Prime Minister on a republic. There is a great deal more I would like to say about the issue. Time prevents me from doing that. I am interested to hear, though, the comments of a former minister of the Crown, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is going to follow me in this debate. Having been a former minister under the Crown, I am sure he will be an independent arbiter of the worth of the Prime Minister's statement. I hope he is. I look forward to his comments on this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member who preceded me in this debate, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in a debate which will be one of the very significant rungs in the development of Australia's nationhood. At the end of the first century of the six colonies which made up what became known as Australia, those six colonies decided that the time, 1 January 1901, was appropriate for them to join together as the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of Australia developing its national character, its nationhood, Australia continued as a constitutional monarchy with the head of state the Queen of England. Subsequently, as a result of legislative changes, the Queen was identified as also being the Queen of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the response on the part of the Australian people is such that there is overwhelming support for the proposition that we use the turn of the next century as a symbolic occasion to add further to the national character of the Australian Commonwealth and determine firmly that Australia, like the overwhelming majority of countries of the world, will have one of its own as its head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise that, whatever else might be said about this question, there is one core issue which must be addressed and which must be answered. It is central. It is fundamental. That question is this: is Australia sufficiently mature, proud and independent, and does Australia have sufficient sovereignty, self-pride and dignity, to have one of its own as its head of state? Or is Australia to continue, as it has now for over 200 years, as six colonies for the first 110 years, and subsequently as the Commonwealth of Australia, to have as its symbolic head of state a person who belongs to another country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the simple question. Members of the opposition have not answered that question. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) did not answer that question. Those opposite continue to avoid the question because they know that the sentiment of the Australian people is such that they believe we are sufficiently proud, we are sufficiently developed, we are sufficiently independent and we do have sufficient self-dignity to say that the Australian head of state should be one of our own. It is simply appalling, to my mind, that anyone could ever possibly assert to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the first question. The core question we must answer is: do we want an Australian as Australia's head of state or are we so fawning as to require a person from another country to be the top symbol of Australia as a nation? Once we have answered that question in the only way we can, the next question automatically falls into place. You cannot have an Australian head of state unless you have an Australian republic. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quite correctly said that he and the government would support a minimalist approach. That is the approach we all endorse as well. There would be no fundamental changes in the way in which Australia operates, except that we would have as our symbolic head an Australian. There would be no other fundamental changes. That is the essence of the minimalist approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach which has been suggested by the opposition would create fundamental, far-reaching and very significant changes in the way in which our parliamentary system operates. This point was made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who spoke earlier for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we refer to that minimalist approach, we mean that the simple change that would be enacted would be that the Governor-General, in effect renamed a president, would replace the monarch as Australia's head of state. The Commonwealth of Australia would continue to be the Commonwealth of Australia. It would not even be renamed the Australian Republic. The powers and responsibilities of the head of state would remain exactly the same as they are at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not even any intention on the part of the government to seek a codification of the reserve powers of the Governor-General. It has been indicated that that attempt will not be made. That is an approach I endorse absolutely because of the intractable problem of codifying those powers&mdash;of defining them, of clarifying them, of making exactly clear how and in what circumstances they are to be used. There will be no change in the powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise a point which has not always been made. Let us be perfectly clear about it. At the present time, the Governor-General is appointed by the Prime Minister&mdash;full stop. The Prime Minister has that single exclusive right, that single exclusive power and authority, to nominate to the monarch the person who will be Governor-General in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Prime Minister proposed? He has proposed that, instead of one person in Australia appointing what the opposition chooses to call our head of state, the Governor-General, the election of a president will require a two-thirds vote of the combined numbers of the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;people who are elected by Australian electors to represent them. That is the essence of the Prime Minister's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the position is not, as has been suggested, that the power to appoint a president is being grabbed by politicians. In fact, the opportunity for the elected representatives of the people to participate in deciding who that head of state should be is being broadened to require election by two-thirds of the combined numbers of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 148 members of this chamber and the 76 members of the Senate would sit together, with at least two-thirds of them being required to vote in support of who was to be president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that, if we are to have two-thirds of the combined numbers of the national parliament determining who the head of state should be, there would need to be discussions, negotiations and agreement between the opposition and the government. If we have agreement, we have a bipartisan decision&mdash;and we would not have a political figure becoming the president of Australia. I know that the opposition would not approve of Gough Whitlam, nor would we approve of Malcolm Fraser. But we might approve of a Ninian Stephen, a Zelman Cowen, a Lois O'Donoghue or a Dick Smith. The head of state would be bipartisan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the proposal of the opposition were adopted, we would have a vote over the whole of Australia by 11 million people. In those circumstances&mdash;and let us be perfectly clear about this&mdash;the Labor Party will nominate its political candidate, the Liberal Party will nominate its political candidate, the National Party will nominate its political candidate, as will the Democrats, as will the Greens, as will any of those very rich Australians who could afford to finance their own individual campaigns. But I will tell you what: there will not be a Ninian Stephen or a Zelman Cowen among them, because neither of those two gentlemen would ever have access to the funds that would be necessary to fund a political election campaign across the whole of Australia. But we will nominate our political candidate&mdash;let us be perfectly clear about it&mdash;and the person who is elected will be a political president. That is precisely what we do not want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the authority of a political president, a person who is elected by 11 million Australians? What if we were to say to that person, `Look, we want you to do for Australia what the Queen does for England and what the Governor-General has been doing for Australia; we want you to be a symbolic figurehead.' That president would say, `Hey now, listen, you just hold on a minute. I've been elected by 11 million Australians. The Prime Minister has been elected by his colleagues within the parliament and by a maximum of 80,000 people within his own electorate.' The president would say to the Prime Minister, `My mandate is a national mandate; yours is a single electoral mandate. Don't you tell me that I have no powers. My authority rests with the nation.' Perhaps the president would say to Mr Keating, `Mr Keating, your authority rests with the electors of Blaxland; my authority, Mr Keating, rests with the nation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want a fundamental change in the way in which this system of government operates, we would adopt the absurd and dangerous proposals that have been put forward by the opposition. Quite apart from the fact that they are dangerous, they are not genuine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have those proposals been? First of all, the Leader of the Opposition said that they would have a people's convention in order to determine the nature of a possible future republic. But he said that he would appoint 50 per cent of that people's convention and that the other 50 per cent would be elected. I am not real smart at mathematics, but I know arithmetic. If the Leader of the Opposition cannot control a convention when he appoints 50 per cent and another 50 per cent is elected, he is not even trying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said that, once that convention considers all of the issues, if there is consensus, if there is general agreement, that a republic should be established, he would be prepared to pursue that. He was asked, `What does that mean&mdash;51 per cent of the people in the convention?' He said, `No, that is not enough.' When asked how many was enough, he replied, `Oh, at least 60 per cent.' So he would appoint 50 per cent of the convention and the other 50 per cent of the convention would be elected. He would control it absolutely&mdash;and he still says, `Unless there is 60 per cent supporting the proposition for a referendum, we would not proceed with it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was then asked, `If the convention cannot come to a consensus about a republic, what will you do?' and he replied, `We will have a referendum.' When asked what the questions would be, he said, `We will give the people multiple-choice questions.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A democracy! You will get a sheet of paper as long as this building with all the multiple-choice questions and you will have to fill in the boxes. Someone said it is a pick-a-box system of determining our system of government. The Leader of the Opposition said about his proposed convention:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it can examine a number of issues. It can examine the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution, including implications of change for the role of the states. It can examine the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments, including areas of overlap and duplication. It can examine the use of the external affairs power of the constitution. It can examine the question of whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms for the federal parliament. It can examine the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation. It can examine any other matters which the convention members would themselves determine.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a deliberate, appallingly cynical and fraudulent proposal because he knows as well as everyone else that such a convention would get bogged down. I do not have time to go into all of the quotes supporting my claim, including one from Zelman Cowen, who is not a member of the Labor Party, but a former great Governor-General.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to speak on the republic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Before I make any comments on his statement, I make a couple of observations about some public comments that have been made about two of our existing vice-regal representatives&mdash;the Governor-General, the Hon. Bill Hayden, and the Governor of Western Australia, Major General Michael Jeffery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems a little amusing that the very same people who leapt to Bill Hayden's defence and said that Bill Hayden ought to be able to speak out on issues on which he feels strongly&mdash;I agree with that, although I heartily disagree with his comments about homosexual adoptions and euthanasia&mdash;have been very critical of the Governor of Western Australia, Michael Jeffery, for making comments of his own. I must say in order to be consistent that I agree with some of the things that Michael Jeffery says and disagree with others. I make the point that I agree with the sentiment that governors-general and governors ought to be able to make observations and public comments so long as they do not bring their offices into disrepute. I would like to defend the rights of both gentlemen to make those statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I make a couple of observations about the so-called republican debate. Republicanism in its latin usage means the public thing. In the final analysis, there is not a great deal of difference or, for that matter, a great deal of effect being proposed by either side in the republican debate, because the real nub of the dilemma facing Australians in their political system in the 1990s is the domination of the parliament of the people by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that all of the issues that have been raised in the republican debate&mdash;the consequences, et cetera&mdash;ought to be put back within the confines of that important debate; that is, the struggle of the Australian people to become sovereign again in their own nation. Quite clearly, as we have seen the development of the Australian model of the Westminster system, we have seen, particularly over more recent years, the extraordinary domination of the political system by the executive, to such an extent that the Prime Minister or the state premiers have all the powers to rival medieval princes in their standing vis-a-vis the parliament and other facets of our political democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to bring the whole debate back into that context, because not to do so is to betray the interests of the very people to which we are referring&mdash;the Australian people&mdash;and their rights, responsibilities and duties as Australian citizens. It is also important to reflect that many of Australia's institutions are already essentially republican institutions. The debate revolves around the question of whether the head of a state should be a constitutional monarch&mdash;in our case, the Queen of Australia and her vice-regal representative, the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, will the change that is being proposed by the Prime Minister in his statement make a great deal of difference to the power and, I suppose, the rights of the people of Australia? I would say, `No, it would make very little difference.' I see the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) nodding&mdash;in fact, the Prime Minister conceded that this is a minimalist difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia are not going to get much out of this at all because, in essence, there will be no change to the essential relationship between executive power and the people of Australia. In other words, the people of Australia will continue to become more and more oppressed in that relationship to such an extent&mdash;as we know within this particular chamber&mdash;that, as much as we care to debate about the issues of the day affecting our nation, at the end of the day the real decisions are made in executive cabinet. The decisions can be made at the whim of the Prime Minister who enjoys the majority of support within that cabinet room. That makes debate in this chamber less and less relevant to the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By making parliament&mdash;the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;less and less relevant to the decision making process, it is progressively withdrawing the power and the authority of the people of Australia. The people of Australia have been referred to in this particular debate but, unfortunately, only in an abstract way. In a way, their relationship with executive power is less definable but, at the conclusion of the Prime Minister's proposal, it is probably no different from the situation in which they find themselves right at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Professor Patrick O'Brien from the University of Western Australia for his observations on these matters. I point out that the best illustration about the abuse of executive power occurred in Western Australia during the 1980s. Professor O'Brien wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now clear that former Premier Brian Burke and his cabinet established almost complete control over parliament, over wide sections of the economy, and over the public purse. Nearly a billion dollars of taxpayers' funds were lost on extraordinary and mainly secret business deals involving donors to the Labor Party. Parliament was never informed of the truth; decisions were made on the run and in concert with conclaves of favoured business people at late-night meetings in private offices and homes; cabinet documents were altered; crucial departmental files either disappeared or were shredded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And that is not all. Secret funds donated by grateful entrepreneurs were used to make large WA contributions to Labor federal election campaigns; in the `80s, federal Labor out-advertised and out-campaigned the coalition at every election. Secret funds were also used to invest tens of thousands of dollars in stamps, gold and property. Burke and several of his ministerial colleagues spent the money solely at their own discretion, and acts of parliament were changed to give ministers power over the boards of all government agencies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In theory, parliament is supposed to be master and the executive the servant. The system no longer works that way, and hasn't for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality, premiers and their cabinets&mdash;not to mention prime ministers and theirs&mdash;now form a sort of "elective dictatorship," with vast, and often unchecked powers.</PARA>
<PARA>When it comes down to it, much of the talk about the consequences of the changes proposed by the Prime Minister and, for that matter, the responses from the opposition have not addressed the significant problem, the dilemma facing the Australian people: how to restore their sovereignty; how to get back people's power in the Australian democratic system; and how to restore the power of the people in particular to this body, the parliament of Australia. As I mentioned earlier, if you look at the relationship now between the people, the parliament and the executive, it is quite clear that the executive is the master while the parliament and the people are its servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would also like to highlight some of the irrelevancies that have occurred in the republican debate&mdash;in particular, the so-called sentiment of the Prime Minister that somehow by Australia's becoming a republic, or his talking about it, people will take him more seriously. I ask honourable members: at a time when one of the oldest republics in the modern political world&mdash;the republic of France&mdash;is thumbing its nose at the views of Australia and treating Australia in a very offhand and dismissive manner, did President Chirac for one minute consider the proposal by the Prime Minister and allow that to alter his point of view? Of course not. It made no difference whatsoever, and neither will it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the talk about somehow increasing Australia's standing by becoming a republic is not only irrelevant but also ludicrous. That sort of talk is patently absurd, particularly when the Prime Minister talks about improving our standing in Asia when we know that many of our surrounding nations have monarchs as their heads of state. I suppose they must look in wonder and bewilderment when the Prime Minister uses overseas trips in order to publicly criticise Australia's institutions&mdash;in countries which may well respect the institutions he is dismissing as irrelevant or out of date. </PARA>

At this stage, I wholeheartedly support the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for a people's convention. But this ought not to be merely a people's convention to determine who ought to be the head of state. This must be a people's convention to look at the fundamental ways in which we can make the Australian people more powerful in their own political system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must look at relationships of the parliament, the executive, the balance of power, checks and balances and also political parties.

We need to look at political parties in recent years. I have already mentioned the WA Labor Party.

Winston Churchill once spoke of the British system. He said that it was the worst system in the world apart from all others. That was a very telling description.

To say that I support the statement of the  Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of 7 June that Australia's head of state should be an Australian and that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001 is somewhat of an understatement. I overwhelmingly endorse it. For me, it is the realisation of a dream I have always had. From an early age I could never understand our system of having a foreigner as our head of state. I have always believed that not only should Australia be a republic but we should have an Australian as our head of state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-republic people always think that being pro-republic is in some way being anti-British. That is certainly not so in my case. I lived for 12 years in the United Kingdom. I went to university there and, dare I say it, some of my closest friends are British. Indeed, I am a frequent visitor to Britain&mdash;although, I must say, to enter Britain now I must go through the gate marked `aliens'. So much for those Australians who want to enter their so-called motherland. Being pro-republic does not equate to being anti-British. So much of our culture, our heritage and even our traditions in this place stem from the Westminster system. Those traditions will always remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It angers me somewhat that those opposed to a republic somehow question one's loyalty. No-one has a monopoly on loyalty. I have never been a flag-waving person who constantly talks about loyalty to Australia or anywhere else. That does not mean that I am not loyal. I just do not parade it all the time. I have always been very suspicious of those who find the constant need to wrap themselves in a flag and go on and on about their loyalty. Why are they so unsure about their loyalty that they have to constantly talk about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who would choose a foreigner, however charming, gracious and kind, to be our head of state must have a problem regarding their own royalty because, try as they might, Mrs Betty Windsor is not Australian. Not by birth is she Australian, and, to my knowledge, she has never been naturalised. She does not reside here. The final irony is that she is now paying British taxes. She does not even pay Australian taxes; she pays British taxes. So Mrs Betty Windsor is a British citizen and a British taxpayer and in no way could it be claimed that she is an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Queen goes abroad for holidays or on a bit of a sales promotion tour, it is not Australian goods and services that she is promoting, but British goods and services. I have absolutely no argument with this but I wish people could accept that she and her wayward children are not Australian and do not represent the hopes and the aspirations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Show anyone in Finland, Chile, China, Japan or any other place a photograph of Mrs Betty Windsor and ask: `Who is this lady?' and the immediate reaction will not be, `She is the Queen of Australia.' I suspect the immediate reaction will be: `She is the Queen of England' or, to be more precise, `She is the Queen of Great Britain.' The point is that no-one abroad and few in Australia except older Australians belonging to National Party branches and, I guess, the CWA represent her as the Queen of Australia. It is time that Australia and Australians believed in themselves, in their own identity and had an Australian as their head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Prime Minister presented the government's preferred option to the parliament, the old campaign has been waged by the defenders in this place of the constitutional monarchy. We have all been told that life as we know it, our society, our system of government, our institutions, will all somehow be completely uprooted and changed. Australia's constitution, our system of government and our institutions will change very little because the government has preferred a minimum of constitutional change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government on 28 April 1993 established a people's advisory committee to prepare an options paper which would set the minimum changes required to create a republic. Since that committee reported to the government, the republic has been widely debated and discussed in the media, in this place, in schools, in universities and in various community groups. All Australians are being exposed to this debate. In the process many Australians believe that the time is right for Australia to become a republic. Importantly too, many Australians believe that Australia becoming a republic is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most honourable members, I have met and talked with hundreds of people about this issue. I have heard, read and talked with many Australians who are totally opposed to Australia becoming a republic. I have asked each of them: `What possible reason do you have as an Australian to oppose a fellow Australian holding the position as this country's head of state?' I have never received a satisfactory answer to this question. I do not believe that I ever will receive it because no fair-minded Australian can oppose a fellow Australian occupying this country's most important position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, if we were charged with the brief, as the founding fathers were almost a century ago, of establishing this country's constitutional arrangements, there would be no thought of having as Australia's head of state someone who resides in another land 12,000 miles from our own. We would not give a second thought to ensuring that Australia's head of state would be an Australian. So what is the difference now? In proposing that our head of state should be an Australian, the government is proposing nothing more than the obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, under the constitution, the Queen is Australia's head of state, and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. Any fair-minded Australian should shake in anger at these words. They are not appropriate, they are not representative and in my view they are offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said that the thing the Americans pride themselves on most is that anyone can hold the most important position in that land; any one of them can become President of the United States, the head of state of the United States. Why should Australians not pride themselves on the very same thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should it not be possible for an Australian citizen to hold pride of place in Australia's highest national office? The simple fact is that it is not possible because of these words: `Australia's head of state is the Queen and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.' These words should be changed, and I believe they will be when the Australian people vote in the referendum in either 1998 or 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes announced by the Prime Minister show that Australia is ready to complete a historical cycle. A century ago the founding fathers put together a collection of colonies to make up one nation. Throughout this century, Australia evolved from a collection of British colonies. We became a single nation with somewhat limited independence. From there, we became a dominion in the British Empire and, finally, we became a sovereign nation in all circumstances, except that we allow another country's head of state to also be our head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am old enough to remember the debates when the Governor-General ceased to be a representative of the British government in Australia and became a representative of the British monarch only. I can well remember the debates about the abolition of all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London. It was only in 1986, with the introduction of the Australia Act, that Australian courts became the final arbiters on Australian law. With the passage of this act, the British parliament finally relented the last of its powers to make laws applying to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can also remember when it was suggested that an Australian occupy the position of Governor-General. The debate was almost ridiculous&mdash;just as this debate about whether or not we should become a republic is. All of these issues caused some kind of controversy. They were peddled by those who still long for the return of the empire, by those who say that an Australian republic would be the end of the world as we know it. That is the same kind of scare campaign that the opposition is running around with now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty years down the track, people are wondering what is happening now. I remember the debate about whether an Australian was fit to become Governor-General. People were saying, `We should have some minor, illegitimate lord from Britain as our head of state.' Twenty years from now, people will look back on these debates and laugh. They will roll about with laughter at the ridiculousness of us wasting the time of the Australian parliament and the community with all this nonsensical debate about something which will be inevitable anyway. It really is inevitable that Australia will become a republic with an Australian as our head of state&mdash;as it should be and as it should have been a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the changes the government seeks are minimal. The essential constitutional conventions, principles and practices will remain untouched and in operation. I suspect that, under a republic, this place will operate much as it operates today. The only difference perhaps will be that Mrs Betty Windsor's photographs about the place will be removed and replaced with photographs of the new Australian head of state. I believe that the role of this chamber and the Senate will remain largely unchanged. Australia will be a republic and continue to be a member of the British Commonwealth of nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only area we seek to change is the wording of the constitution. We would change `Governor-General' to `President of the Commonwealth of Australia', ensuring that the person who holds this office is an Australian citizen. This president will perform much the same duties as the Governor-General. As happens now, these duties will be carried out on the advice of the government of the day. The president will perform ceremonial duties around Australia and represent Australia abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president will also retain those few powers now held by the Governor-General which may be exercised without, or contrary to, ministerial advice. The so-called `reserve powers'&mdash;the power to appoint the Prime Minister and the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and the government&mdash;will remain untouched. There has been some argument about why we in the Labor Party should support this. We support the fact that those reserve powers are there, because we realise that it would be in only the most extreme of circumstances&mdash;as it was in 1975 when they were illegally used&mdash;that those powers would be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some debate about how the head of state should be elected. I favour election by parliament, but I can see merit on both sides. I can see the merit of the president being elected by the people like, say, the Irish President and the French President, and I can see the merit of the president being elected by the parliament. So I am not going to the wall over this one. But I do think that, if we are going to have a non-political person in that office, it is inevitable that he or she be elected by the parliament, because once there is a campaign, as we saw in the recent French election campaign, the president becomes a very political person&mdash;and it is a political act electing that person. We as members of parliament are elected by the people. I think that a president who is elected by the parliament would be elected with the agreement of both sides of the parliament. As with the appointment of governors-general, it takes that political aspect away from the role of the president. If we want people in that position who command the respect of the majority of the population, I believe that it is only by having them chosen by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of the two chambers that we will get that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the members of parliament, are elected by the people and in that way we would be representing the people. I cannot for the life of me see how a constitutional convention of 200 elected people and 200 appointed people can be seen to be reflective of the Australian point of view. The 200 appointed people would obviously be reflective of whoever appoints them. The real difficulty that the opposition has in this whole debate is that fundamentally it does not believe that an Australian should be this country's head of state. I know there is some division there, but in the main its problem is that it does not believe in an Australian occupying that position. Australia is making its way in this complex world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The first is: what is the nature of the change that those people who propose it wish to have? The second is: how will that make Australia a better place?

Having heard his answer to the first, I am still of the opinion that our present system serves us very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if we are to have a debate&mdash;and I am never one to run from a debate; I am always anxious to take part&mdash;I think we have to have a fulsome debate and look at what flows from the possibility of change. I do not have a crystal ball, I have never pretended to have a crystal ball, so I do not know what may happen in the future and I do not know what event may act as a catalyst for change. I do know that at the present time we have not got one, and when you bring about change in a vacuum you usually get it wrong. If you bring about change when there is a catalyst, you can usually see the direction that you ought to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had we lost World War II and not been the victors, we would be operating under a very different system indeed. We would not be the constitutional monarchy that we are today which ensures freedom of speech for individuals, which ensures the right to achieve maximum potential and enables us to conduct ourselves as a truly multicultural society where the contribution of every individual is acknowledged and important. I have not seen any riots in the streets by people saying, `We have to bring about change to our constitution because we are not free.' I have heard the arguments put forward in a manner that reflects, I think, prejudice of a different sort, perhaps in the manner of one of the speeches we might have heard earlier this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal that has come forward starts from a premise which is fundamentally flawed. The opening premise is that a very small change&mdash;a minimalist change&mdash;can be made and nothing else will change. The system will continue to function as it is. That is a flawed proposition. It will be argued that there can be an election by the parliament: that is, a collegiate election of a head of state and that this person somehow remains above the political process. Nonsense. Once that person is elected&mdash;it does not matter whether the election is by collegiate system, as in the United States of America where the president is elected by a college of votes, or whether the head of state is elected by the people in a plebiscite&mdash;the bottom line is that the head of state is an elected person, and an elected person always has a mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our current system, appointment by Her Majesty the Queen is the method by which we select a head of state who is truly above politics. Very simply, the Prime Minister of the day selects an individual and makes a recommendation to the Queen. That nomination may be rejected&mdash;convention has it that it is not&mdash;and the appointment is duly made. Bill Hayden, when he was appointed to the position, acted up until that moment entirely as a political person. After he was appointed to the position he has behaved, as have all governors-general, in an apolitical way and has carried out the responsibilities in a non-political way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day, when the Governor-General chose to speak his mind on a number of subjects, his remarks were of interest for people to read, but they had no political clout because he is a man without a mandate. Had the same person been an elected president and made that speech, it would become politically relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is quite substantial. To say that there can be a minimalist change and that all things will continue on as they are is like saying that you can be a little bit pregnant. You cannot&mdash;things flow from the change. If the time comes that there is ever to be an elected president, my view is that the people should do the electing. That is the view that the rest of Australia seems to have&mdash;if the polls are any guide. Although I do recall that in 1988 we were faced with a referendum to change the constitution and in the opinion polls, about 80 per cent of people said, `Yes, this change is excellent and we must have it,' but once we got into the detail of it and what it was really entailing not one single state passed the referendums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we look at the detail and what is really involved. Let us suppose that the people had their way. If there were to be a change and a president were to be elected by the people, what would flow from that? Currently, we operate under what we call the Westminster system, although I suggest that under the current government we do not. Under this government we see instances where ministers who have been found wanting and in error have refused to resign until they are virtually forced from office&mdash;for example, Mrs Kelly over sports rorts or Graham Richardson over the infamous Marshall Islands affair. There have been many instances where people have not behaved in accordance with the Westminster principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Westminster principle we should have an apolitical Public Service; that is, a public service which merely serves the government of the day to the best of its ability with the best research and effort that is possible. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case either. Although there are first-class, splendid public servants who wish to perform in that way, through the influence of the current government we have public servants in senior positions who are very political in the way they behave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we look at what is an alternative to a Westminster system should we have an elected president. One model we can look at is the congressional system in the United States. There it has a true doctrine of the separation of powers, not as we have here. Here, although we have the judiciary separate from the legislature and the executive, we do not separate the executive and the legislature. Our ministers come from the legislative body, in this chamber and across the way, but under the congressional system, where there is a true doctrine of the separation of powers in operation, the executive comes by way of appointment by the president from people outside the elected congress. It may well be that, if we were to move to an elected presidential system, the people of Australia may also consider that to move to an appointed executive outside the elected membership may be a better way to proceed. It is often heard in debate from people who criticise the calibre of the ministers&mdash;and anyone who sees this chamber on B-day when the B-team is in can see it&mdash;that there is a lot lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is this: if we are to embrace the thought of change and have a true debate, we need a forum where it can be held honestly. This is not the place for that debate because here, under our Westminster system&mdash;altered and perhaps corrupted as it is&mdash;we still have the system where the Prime Minister, the person who says he has a majority in the House to support the passage of the appropriation bills through both houses of parliament, is given a commission to form a government by the head of state, the Governor-General, Bill Hayden; and he looked pretty Australian to me last time I took a look. That government then consists of the people chosen by the Prime Minister, the man to whom the commission is given. He currently selects about 30 people to become members of the Executive Council. Those people and those people alone form the government. The Labor Party backbenchers are no more members of government than I am. Their responsibility is the same as mine; that is, to provide laws which are for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia. Their positioning on the right-hand side of the Speaker's chair is merely to indicate that they are giving support to the government to ensure the passage of its legislation and particularly the appropriation bills&mdash;the granting of supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw in 1975 that it is the Governor-General who is the head of state in this country, who holds the reserve powers, who has the power to sack the government of the day, which simply means he or she withdraws the commission that has been given because that government can no longer carry out its undertaking to ensure the passage of supply. So that is the way the system works. But, if we are to have the change to the president, we could see the situation where the president of the day has been elected by two-thirds of the parliament, as the Prime Minister would wish, and he sends his legislation up to the head of state and the head of state says, `Veto.' The Prime Minister says, `You can't do that to me.' `Yes, I can,' says the president, `just watch me. Now get two-thirds of the parliament to sack me.' It might be a piece of legislation like the new 12 per cent wholesale sales tax with regard to building materials that might be chosen to be vetoed, and two-thirds of the parliament might think that is a jolly good idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of questions that have to be addressed. There are lots of queries and uncertainties that need to be debated, and the place to have that is in a people's forum, because in this place it is only the government of the day that can introduce the bill for the referendum. It is only the government which would have input into what goes into that bill and it would be a take it or leave it scenario. But, if you have a people's convention, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has proposed and given an undertaking to have, the people who are not truly represented in their view, as they see it, will have a say. The government of the day has said it will only offer a president who is elected by the parliament, and the people of Australia have shown that they do not want that, and it is only the government of the day which will have a say as to what goes into that bill that brings about the referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under our system, there is even a fail-safe mechanism. There is the people's convention, and then there is a plebiscite. The plebiscite would have the following options: elected by the parliament, elected by the people, status quo, et cetera. So a whole range of things could come out of that. Depending on the outcome of that plebiscite, the referendum would then be formulated. It would not be formulated by the government of the day. It would not be formulated by the now Prime Minister saying, `I, me, myself, personally, Paul Keating, am going to dictate that that is the choice you will be given,' but by the option being given to hundreds of Australians to have the opportunity to take part in the discussion process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that, once we got into the detail, the nature of the debate on the republic would change dramatically, and it has. We are now looking at the detail in earnest. We are looking at the ramifications. We are looking at what we want&mdash;from now and forever more&mdash;as our system of governance. The government has answered the first question by putting up a proposal. It is one which I reject. The opposition offers a more acceptable alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question&mdash;how it makes Australia a better place&mdash;remains to be answered by those who say they want to bring about the change as manifested in the Prime Minister's greater wish. As we debate this, we know that the option is one of choice. The government offers none. The option is to take what the Prime Minister of the day wishes it to be or to allow the people of Australia to have a say in what happens to their constitution. The bottom line is that the constitution of Australia belongs to the Australian people. It does not belong to the Prime Minister or to the government of the day.

It is a nonsense to suggest that a constitution of the type that Australia has is anything but the property of the people. It is the same as suggesting that this parliament is owned by the politicians who inhabit it. It is not. It is a product of the will of the Australian people. I reject the nonsense spoken by some members on the other side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mackellar has, like other members of the opposition, put up this furphy that the Governor-General is the head of state of Australia. It is an absolute nonsense. Either they do not understand what the Australian constitution is or they have not read it. The Australian constitution is, in fact, a bill of the British parliament. It clearly defines that the head of state of Australia is the monarch of Great Britain whom, in some strange way, we call the Queen of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reality is that the British monarch is simply that&mdash;the British monarch. Queen Elizabeth II is a fine and upright woman. I have met her, and I have nothing but admiration for her. Nevertheless, she is the monarch of Great Britain. By some strange legal reasoning, Australia has decided to adopt her and call her the Queen of Australia. Clearly, the head of state is the British monarch. So no-one in the coalition should try to promote this nonsense that somehow the Governor-General is the Australian head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General's role in the Australian constitution is as a representative of Australia's head of state. The role of the Governor-General is to represent the Queen in Australia and to be the representative of Her Majesty in the Executive Council under the formulation and the rules which exist in the Australian constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a debate such as this, the lack of understanding in this House on the nature of the Australian constitution is also something that worries me. The constitution is a document which is vacant on most of the important things that matter in running this parliament. For example, most Australians do not understand that there is no such thing as a Prime Minister mentioned in the entire Australian constitution. It is not mentioned&mdash;not once. It is a convention that there is a Prime Minister. It is not written into our constitution. It is a convention, because we all understand that without the conventions operating we would not have a constitution which would work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Australian constitution is lacking in almost everything that a modern constitution needs. We are only talking about one part of it&mdash;a minor part of it. I must say that, if I had my way, I would rewrite the entire constitution, because it is a terribly deficient document. Can you imagine having a constitution which does not recognise the position of Prime Minister? It does not mention the word once in the entire document. It operates only on the basis of what we call conventions. Conventions are simply unwritten rules which people in the political system accept as being proper and reasonable so that the system can in fact run. Without the recognition of the conventions, we would not have a parliament that would work. That is how bad the Australian constitution really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some members opposite it is some sacred document written in blood&mdash;something magical and special. The fact is, of course, that when it was written it was written in conflict. It was a compromise. It is not a perfect document. It was a compromise between six competing colonies who were not particularly interested in a federation. They wanted to maintain their own separate political identities. There were free traders and protectionists. Again, I do wish some people in this House would actually pick up a book on Australian history and read it. I do wish they would actually learn the background to how the Australian constitution came into existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast bulk of conventions, so-called, that were held to draft the Australian constitution were not elected. Only one was elected&mdash;the last one. But the conventions that actually drew up the constitution were not elected because, in most locally held referenda, the Australian people did not want to federate. It was the leaders of the day, who understood the great need for Australia to become a great nation, who led the arguments and brought the general feeling of the people with them. That is what needs to be done in changing a constitution. You need leaders. You need people to stand up and put a proposition to people and say, `We believe we need change and this is the change we believe we need.' That is called leadership. It might be that the Australian people reject that view. Nevertheless, the fact that it has been brought into the public domain, that it is now a topic which is being publicly debated, is only because there is a leader&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is not the sort of thing we would ever get from the other side of the House. There is never any leadership from that side in terms of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian constitution was developed by people such as Deakin, despite the general lack of will in the then colonies to federate. We eventually got federation because there were leaders back then who were prepared to carry the people, take some political flak and run the argument. So it is important that the argument be put. It is important that we debate it. It may well be that the end result of change to the Australian constitution may not be what I necessarily agree with because, ultimately, it will be Australian people who make the decision&mdash;not me, not this parliament, not the Prime Minister, but the Australian people. However, it is proper that views are put on what sorts of changes we, collectively or individually, see as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have probably given more oaths to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors to title than most other Australians.

On the other hand, she is not an Australian citizen; she is a foreigner. That is an unarguable fact. She does not have Australian citizenship. She is a foreigner. I have often wondered when I have taken multiple oaths over the years why I was being asked as an Australian to give an oath of loyalty and allegiance to a British monarch. I am pleased that finally I am getting the chance to say in this parliament that I am an Australian first, an Australian second, an Australian third, and I would like to have an Australian head of state. There is nothing wrong with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people can disagree with it. Some people can say they are happy to have a British citizen as the head of state of Australia. That is an acceptable view if that is what they want. But I am an Australian, and I want an Australian head of state. I do not want to be represented by a foreigner&mdash;be that foreigner British, American or whatever. If people want to criticise me for that, let them. If they want to be represented by a foreigner, let them stand up and say that. That is the major issue that has to be first answered: do Australians want an Australian head of state or do Australians want a foreign head of state?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can debate all of these things, but until members of the opposition answer that principal question we will not get to first base because their proposals, quite frankly, avoid the issue. The whole philosophy behind the approach of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) of having a convention of which 50 per cent would be elected and 50 per cent appointed by him&mdash;no doubt, as Prime Minister&mdash;is to avoid the issue. It is to avoid having to put a question to the people in the first place. It is the way the conservatives of this country want to avoid the debate. It puts it away, puts it aside, and does not solve the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there a fear of the debate? Are the conservatives of this country and in this parliament frightened of the debate because they have not got the numbers out there? Is that the reason they would go for this quite nonsensical approach of having 50 per cent appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, no doubt, and 50 per cent elected. We do not know how they are going to be elected or what the franchise would be. We do not know anything about how the other 50 per cent would be elected. We do not know what reference the convention would be given. We do not know what they would be asked to discuss, what the details are of what the convention would be asked to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming this convention accepted the view that Australia should change to an Australian head of state, we have no guarantee at all from the opposition that it would do it. If the opposition is elected, puts up its convention and, despite having 50 per cent of its members appointed so that it can control them, the convention recommends that there be a referendum, a minimalist position, and accepts an Australian as an Australian head of state, there is no guarantee a conservative government would put it to the Australian people. It is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is their fear? Why are honourable members frightened of asking the Australian people? I frankly do not understand it. I do not understand why anyone in this parliament would be frightened of the Australian people having the choice. The proposition put forward by the Leader of the Opposition denies that choice, takes it away from people and stifles the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am totally baffled as to why the opposition is frightened of the Australian people and frightened of why they should not have that choice. I noted that the member for Mackellar was talking about the Public Service in Australia and the apolitical nature she thinks it should have. The implication of what she said is that the Public Service in Australia is politicised. That was the allegation she put to the House in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there has ever been a politicised body in this country it was when Barwick went to the High Court, as Chief Justice Barwick. When Barwick was the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia the Australian taxation system was totally torn asunder. Under section 260 of the tax act, a very simple section&mdash;I would say a five-year-old child could tell you what it meant&mdash;tax avoidance was illegal. That is all it said, but somehow or other the Barwick court managed to rule that that did not mean anything. Under Barwick, people of privilege and people of wealth were given the option of paying no tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Russell clearly demonstrated in a report to this House that, under Barwick and under this apolitical system that the honourable member for Mackellar suggests applies when the opposition is in government, the taxation system was destroyed.

Let us have none of this nonsense, this waffle, from the member for Mackellar about this government criticising the Public Service.

We have a debt in this country, for example, that is greater than Mexico's. It is unbelievable that we have been reduced to that status under this government. A debt greater than Mexico's is something that we ought to be ashamed of, something that we certainly should be doing something about, and the government will not even allow us to have a question time tomorrow to talk about the current account deficit figures when they come out, let alone have a debate on the debt that this country is carrying, which is now greater than Mexico's. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A debate on the republic will cost the parliament, depending how long it goes, something like $200,000 or $300,000 today alone. I would like to have that money, for example, for three kilometres of bitumen between Bourke and Wanaaring. I am sure my constituents out there would prefer that. But why are we having this debate? We are having it because the government is using it as a diversionary tactic from the problems, some of which I have just mentioned, that are besetting this country, and apparently because of the apparent paranoia of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about anything that is British. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 11 years that I have been a member of parliament I have not had one constituent come to my office and request that Australia move toward a republic. I have not had one person telephone me and I have not had one letter on the subject. I do not deny that there may be people out there who hold this view, which is quite right and proper to have in a democracy, but it is obviously not a burning issue with them. There are 80,000 voters in my electorate and 110,000 constituents when you count those under 18 years&mdash;and never in 11 years has anyone approached me on this particular matter. They certainly are not tossing and turning in their sleep about this issue; I can assure the government of that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are the Australian people not demanding that this happen in the same way as the government is demanding it happen?

We have a stable system of government that is envied by the rest of the world. We live in a very free country, a very tolerant, multicultural country.

I know we call it a monarchy but to all intents and purposes, given the way the system works in this country, we already are a republic. I do not know what the percentage would be but Australia would be very close to 99 per cent a republic anyhow. We have only got this little bit tacked on the end, this one per cent, this monarchy bit tacked on the end, and it is totally harmless. It gives the Queen no effective power whatsoever over the running of this country. If the Queen had some power to direct us how to conduct the laws of this nation or our daily lives, I too would be arguing that that link be cut.

I had never been to a communist country before, and apart from the stark, colourless concrete buildings and streets everywhere, and the people with blank looks on their faces, the thing that horrified me the most was that on the buildings were enormous photos of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Todor Zhikov, who was the president of Bulgaria at the time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those feelings of insecurity at the very first time of white settlement in Australia, this feeling of protection was woven into our culture, our institutions and our system of government. The sense of insecurity and the need for protection was given expression through tariff protection, the attempt to shelter Australian markets from overseas goods. It was expressed through the White Australia policy which enjoyed bipartisan political support for so long, giving expression to the feeling that we needed to lock out people from other races and other nations, particularly in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sense of insecurity was expressed through our foreign policy: our reliance on the protection of, firstly, the Royal Navy and, during and after the Second World War, the United States of America. It was also expressed through the cultural cringe: the feeling that the only worthwhile items of culture and expression could come from Britain. Robert Hughes, in his outstanding book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Fatal Shore,</EMPHASIS> captures the mood so well:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea that whether or not England should feel ashamed of creating the [convict] system, Australians certainly had cause to be proud of surviving it and creating their own values despite it, was rarely heard.</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia at that time, and indeed for more than a century, Britain was seen as the only source of social respectability. Again, according to Hughes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing could be allowed to diminish the gratitude Australians were meant to feel for the imperial umbrella. The essence of colonisation was that they could claim no history of their own . . . educators played their part, with the result that it became impossible to find in any history book in any Australian schools up to the mid-1960s, a satisfactory or even coherent account of penal Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In this respect, British trade, British arts, British literature, British symbols, British institutions and, most of all, the British monarchy, were used by Australians for so many decades of our early history as part of the search for respectability. For the tories of that time&mdash;and for the tories of this time&mdash;it was all about touching the hem of the British monarchy, that feeling of cultural insecurity and cultural cringe, and the search for what was regard as social respectability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popular culture of those years of course reinforced the view of the British as a superior race of people. The royal family stood at the pinnacle of that system. The republic is about breaking the cultural cringe for all time. It is about recognising, for all time, that Australia should assume in all aspects of our social and cultural fabric the responsibilities of an independent and mature nation. The cultural cringe extended far beyond the realm of the arts. For so many years, it made the country wary of assuming proper responsibili ties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have broken free and matured and picked up responsibilities in so many areas. We show confidence in the way we have internationalised our economy; we no longer feel insecure about pursuing a place in the world economy. We have matured and picked up responsibilities through an independent defence and foreign policy. We have picked up responsibilities through transport and communication improvements which have integrated Australia as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have picked up responsibility in culture, in the arts and letters, with a distinctive and a very proud sense of Australian cultural identity. We have picked up our proper responsibilities towards Aboriginal people with the historic decision of the High Court and the legislation of this parliament for native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republic and constitutional change in the 1990s is about topping up that process, breaking the cringe for all time. In our constitutional arrangements we should exercise the proper responsibilities of a mature, independent nation by making an Australian our head of state. Breaking the cringe says something about Australia's identity and our sense of worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republic in many respects should be seen as a celebration of the Australian achievement. Far from cringing, we should be telegraphing it and informing the world that we are very proud of what we have achieved in this nation, to settle a harsh country and build economic prosperity. To do it within a tolerant, progressive, egalitarian society is one of the great achievements of the Western world, and constitutional independence can top it off. Constitutional independence would be the full expression of nationhood and the ultimate celebration of the great Australia achievement. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine said it well in June of last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only colonies continue to borrow the monarchies of other lands.</PARA>
<PARA>I would urge the Liberal and National party representatives in this house to take a look across the Tasman, where a small trading nation at the bottom of the South Pacific, led in that instance by a conservative government, is breaking free of the colonial mentality. Jim Bolger, the New Zealand Prime Minister, is trying to advance the cause of a New Zealand republic. Let me quote Bolger:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see it as completing the journey from colony to nationhood.</PARA>
<PARA>New Zealand is in similar circumstances to Australia in the broad sweep of history. Its Prime Minister, a conservative Prime Minister, sees the republic as completing the journey from colony to nationhood. As it is in New Zealand, it should be in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, the republic represents a great opportunity to rectify some of the problems with the constitutional monarchy. At the end of the day, in a modern, liberal, progressive, egalitarian society, the monarchy can be regarded, and I think broadly is regarded, throughout Australia as unrepresentative and undemocratic. There is an objection across the nation to filling public offices in a fashion which relies on inheritance. It is contrary to the belief that all people are born equal in status, dignity and opportunity. The rules of succession for the monarchy as we have them in Australia discriminate on the basis of religion, sex and birth. Section 116 of the Australia constitution prohibits the imposition of any religious test as a qualification for any office under the Commonwealth, yet our head of state, the British monarch, also serves as the head of the Anglican Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, our own Sex Discrimination Act would render the rules of succession unlawful in Australia, because they discriminate actively for men and discriminate against women. For Australians interested in social equality, religious tolerance and equal opportunity between the sexes, the monarchy has become an unrepresentative, unsuitable, divisive institution in our society. It has been used in the past to show that Australians were of British stock. That is clearly no longer the case. The monarchy is perhaps well suited to a class ridden society like Britain, but it is totally unsuited to Australia's egalitarian traditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Francis Adams in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Essays</EMPHASIS> put it best as long ago as 1886:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people in Australia breathe free. They do not feel the weight of the great divisions of the middle class that is above them, the well-to-do and the gentlemen. Working men here do not go slouching down the streets, as they do in England, crushed under the sense of their inferiority. . . This is a true republic, the truest, as I take it, in the world. In England the average man feels that he is inferior: in America he feels that he is superior: in Australia he feels that he is equal. That is indeed delightful.</PARA>
<PARA>So, if we have had in our social status, in our social fabric, this feeling of republic egalitarianism, it should be fully confirmed now in the 1990s in Australia's constitutional arrangements. For once, on this matter I can agree with the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. He said in the second reading speech on the Royal Style and Titles Bill 1953:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plain truth is that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second sits on the throne not because of some law of Australia but because of the law of the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA>Menzies thought that was acceptable because he regarded himself as British, as of British stock. But now, when Australians no longer regard themselves in that fashion, it is no longer suitable for the Australian head of state to be determined by British law. The Australian head of state should be one of us. The Australian head of state should be determined by Australians under Australian laws passed by this parliament and confirmed at a constitutional referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that an Australian citizen, under the current arrangements, can never be the Australian head of state. That is a decisive breach, an unacceptable breach, of Australian sovereignty and independence. It is interesting to note that Prince Charles himself acknowledged as much in June last year when he said that, as an heir and successor, he would rather be seen as a defender of faith than a defender of `the faith'. That is, he acknowledged that all citizens are equally important irrespective of religion. It is divisive for the monarchy to be associated with just one form and one expression of faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prince Charles also said that it is absurd the monarch should be prevented from marrying a Catholic. So if Prince Charles believes the monarchy, as presently structured, does not represent all Britons, how can it represent all Australians? Prince Charles is saying that the head of state in Britain must be representative of British society. In Australia, surely that means the head of state must be an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A republic is a state in which sovereignty is derived from people, not from inheritance, and in which all public offices are filled by persons ultimately deriving their authority from the people. The only Australian office incompatible with a republic is the monarchy, and the only change required to overcome that shortcoming is to remove the monarchy from our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Queen visits Australia she is seen more as the Queen of Britain than the Queen of Australia, otherwise she serves as an absentee head of state. When the Queen visits other nations, she is seen as the Queen of Britain. Australia does not have a head of state who can represent this nation overseas and be seen by foreign citizens as our head of state, as an Australian. That, in their eyes, makes Australia look like a colony. Some of the comments of the British head of state when she travels overseas could potentially contradict Australian foreign policy and trade interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is this: not only is the monarchy unrepresentative and undemocratic by the standards of the 1990s but also the royal family itself is discredited. I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper earlier this month that the British Scout Association has decided to disaffiliate itself from Prince Charles, saying, `It will be hard for some people to promise'&mdash;that is, to swear&mdash;`their allegiance of duty to an adulterer.' What a telltale sign&mdash;that the British monarchy in the 1990s cannot sustain the support of the British Scout Association. For the monarchy as an institution, particularly in this country, it is five minutes to midnight. Time is up for the monarchy. It is time for Australia to express itself as a mature, independent, egalitarian and progressive nation. It is time we had an Australian as our head of state. We need to make sure that our head of state is one of us. </PARA>

The government of today will present to the people of Australia the option that they vote either yes or no on how to go about this, how to develop it, how to structure this move. As has been indicated in the polls, the majority of people in Australia do not agree with that system either. The government should be very cognisant of that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), served a fairly lengthy time in local government, where people demand a say. I also have a background in local government. He was probably elected to the mayoral position, which he held before he came into this place, by popular vote as well. It is the absolute basis of the democratic process of Australia. You cannot devolve the power any lower than to give all the people a say in who leads them or in what happens in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the government speakers in this debate today have been running the line that the Prime Minister has been running&mdash;that is, we want an Australian as our head of state. That is an interesting argument when the occupant of the position of Governor-General has, since 1965, always been an Australian. That is the political angle that the government is trying to put on this debate. It is trying to generate a bit more anti-British emotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit the United Kingdom with a group of young Australian people from the Labor Party, the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Democrats. When talking to different people throughout the United Kingdom, the one dominant question was: is the government's push or the notion of moving towards a republic in Australia purely born out of a hate for the British? That is the feeling that they are getting in the United Kingdom. We had to dispel that myth and point out that it is not born out of a hate for the British. We pointed out that, unfortunately, that is the line the Prime Minister of Australia is running. We have heard this line from some of the government speakers in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of people in Australia who believe that we should be moving towards a republic, but who do not hold the same views as the government. Some people hold the view that maybe Australia has reached the stage where it is going through puberty blues or a change in identity and therefore it is time to revisit the issues. It is really the people of Australia who should be having an input. It should not be the 148 representatives in this parliament who make a decision and make this into a political debate between now and when the Prime Minister decides he wants to hold his referendum and ask the people of Australia whether or not they are prepared to accept his option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position is that the people of Australia should be involved in this discussion from the beginning. We believe that they should be involved all the way through. The people of Australia should make the decision when we have the constitutional referendum before the turn of the century. What is wrong with giving the people of Australia a decent dose of democracy? It is about time that a few more people around this place&mdash;particularly those on the government side&mdash;recognised that we do live in a democratic society and that we should be giving the people of Australia a dose of democracy in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the positions at this point? The government has declared that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001. It keeps running the line that the head of state should be an Australian. The opposition says that since 1965 the Governor-General, as the Australian head of state, has been an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key proposal advanced by the government in terms of the establishment of a federal republic is the election of a federal president. It says that the president should be an Australian and elected by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both houses of parliament on the nomination of the Prime Minister and cabinet. The government also believes that the question of Australia becoming a republic should be put to the people in 1998 or 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the coalition's position? The coalition proposes the establishment of a people's convention in 1997 which would examine not just whether or not Australia should become a republic but other important issues as well. One of the issues is the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution. Another issue is the implications of a change in the role of the states. There is an underlying complication in this debate which relates to the states. The conundrum could arise where the Commonwealth as a whole wants to head down a certain path but one of the states does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues that should be addressed at a people's convention are the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments, including areas of overlap and duplication; whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms of parliament; and the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation. Other matters which the people's convention would determine itself would also be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people's convention would consist of 50 per cent of members who have been appointed by the government of the day, 10 per cent of whom would be between the ages of 18 and 25, and 50 per cent of members who have been elected. The arguments for a people's convention, as put forward by the coalition, include enabling a range of community views to enable proper examination, gauging the mood for change in the Australian community, and providing a forum which unifies rather than divides the community. As I said earlier, we need to devolve power to the lowest possible level and empower the people of Australia with the ability to participate in the development of this debate from start to finish. This provides a forum which unifies rather than divides the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister says that you are either for the republic or you are against it. He says, `Either you stand over there or you stand over here with me.' That is not unifying this nation. If that is what the republican debate today is all about, I do not believe it is going down the right path. We should allow the people of Australia to decide the questions and the options for the referendum. We should involve all Australian people at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. This would create a unifying position for the people of Australia. We should have a broader group of people than the government of the day deciding the arguments for and against, putting the propositions for and against, and developing the questions to be asked in the constitutional referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of this whole issue relates to how much say and how much democracy the government is prepared to give the people of Australia. By `say' I am not just referring to what is written in the newspapers; I am referring to constructive criticism about this whole debate and the direction we are heading in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current constitutional arrangements have served Australia well, delivering great stability, cohesion and tolerance. Those points cannot be undermined or debated by the government. Australia is one of the most stable countries in the world today, and this is because of our constitutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's comments about an Australian head of state are an attempt to imply that anyone who opposes a republic is a lesser Australian. The reality is that, over the past 30 years, the Governor-General has become Australia's constitutional head of state. That position has been occupied by an Australian since 1965. It is unthinkable that anyone but an Australian would occupy that position in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the success of the present constitution, many Australians are attracted to the idea of a republic. The coalition believes that the matter should be fully debated and that ultimately a vote should be taken on the issue before the turn of the century. In government, the coalition will in 1997 establish a people's convention to debate the whole issue. Other matters will be discussed at the people's convention. However, the issue of Australia's head of state will be debated first and separate from all other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a consensus emerges from the people's convention regarding the head of state, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. If no consensus emerges, then the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for changes to establish which of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing the president by direct popular vote as well as by a parliamentary vote as proposed by the Prime Minister. Another method of election could also emerge as an option from the whole process of discussion. Naturally, the option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the government, particularly the Prime Minister, is facing a bit of a problem at the moment. As has been indicated in some of the polls that have been conducted since the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on this issue, the level of support around Australia for a republic is about 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet there has been another interesting element to the poll; that is, the question of how we arrive at that position, whether directly via the Prime Minister's approach&mdash;come and vote on my development for a republic, on how I want to have it&mdash;or via the Leader of the Opposition's process of a people's convention, having a broader base of discussion and debate. It is interesting that 38 per cent supported the approach of holding a people's convention to discuss constitutional reform compared with 36 per cent support for the Keating republican blueprint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that tell you? That tells you that, although there is a view across the nation&mdash;as yet not a majority view&mdash;that Australia should head down the republican path, the people of Australia want to have more involvement in the early stages of the debate. They do not want to be just dished up with a yes or no answer, whether you have this type of republic and we will select or elect the president this way or the head of state this way. They want to be involved in formulating the arguments on both sides of that debate. They want to be involved from the start, through the middle and towards the finish of that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it flies in the face of everything that we stand for in this place as members of this federal parliament, as representatives of the people of Australia, to deny the people of Australia that democratic right in what could possibly be, and arguably will be if we do end up at a constitutional referendum, the most enormous change that we are going to make to the way this country runs, to the constitution of this country, since Federation. I do not believe that the government has the right to deny the people of Australia from having that broader input into that debate in developing those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge is there. The cards are quite clearly on the table. On the one hand, there is the proposal by the government of the day, the Prime Minister's blueprint for a republic, to push towards a constitutional referendum in the latter part of this century. On the other hand, there is the very clear position of the coalition&mdash;that in 1997 we head for a people's convention so that we can devolve the debate, devolve the power, and empower the people of Australia to have a much broader input into the development of the arguments for and against the question, and the development of the debate, as to whether we should go towards a republic, whether the head of state should be selected and elected by a two-thirds majority of this parliament, or whether the head of state should be elected by everybody in Australia. The people of Australia have the right to have that decent dose of democracy dished up to them, so they can have input in this debate from the start, through the middle as well as at the end. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are all Australians. We share a continent. We share a past, a present and a future. And our Head of State should be one of us.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard much in this discussion about a republic, and it seems that some people feel the very fabric of Australian society is being challenged. Let me say to you that surely the issue of an Australian head of state does go to the heart of the Australian government. It is surely an issue about equality. We need to look at the role of the constitutional monarchy and ask ourselves: who is a monarch? Where do monarchs come from? What gives them authority to rule? What gives them authority to rule is an accident of birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most of us now would recognise that there are values and attitudes within the British monarchy that most of us as Australians would not wish to emulate, nor would we wish to espouse. When we look to our own nation as an Australian we see the kinds of things that make us Australian. At the heart of it is the issue of equality. At the heart of it is the right&mdash;more importantly, the obligation&mdash;of all Australian citizens to exercise their democratic right to vote. There is no question of a notion of birth, of where one comes from or of who one is. It simply states that as Australians, as citizens of this nation, we have equality before the law and in the role of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear members of the opposition talk about the notion of stability which comes from a constitutional monarchy. I suggest to members of the opposition that one of the great things that leads to stability within the Australian democratic process is the fact that we all participate, that there is a role for each and every one of us. Contrary to very many other industrialised nations in which small groups of people who happen to be better educated, happen to have more money or happen to be able to buy votes are the people who rule, all Australians vote and we in this parliament represent our electors. In fact, once that election has taken place, we then represent all of those people who reside within that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who was talking about doses of democracy, that he should run his own discussions on the constitutional monarchy, that he should represent the kinds of views he believes are abroad in his electorate. I suggest that he will find that more than half the people with whom he mixes are enamoured of the idea of an Australian head of state and an Australian republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on this notion of a people's convention. The coalition is the same lot of people who say, `Get government off our backs' and `Don't have government interfere.' Suddenly the role of a people's convention, to which it appoints 50 per cent of the people, is now some sacred cow. It is an extraordinary claim that a people's convention to which it appoints half the delegates will be the forum for open and free discussion. What a lot of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking realistically about the notion of a head of state being elected by two-thirds of both houses of this parliament, we can say almost categorically that that person will not be from the field of politics. If, however, we are to have a universally elected head of state, we can absolutely and categorically expect that that person will be either party political or extraordinarily rich. We will be looking at someone who has to garner the votes of 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 Australians and who needs the wherewithal and the financial capital to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that person is not a member of one of the two major political parties, which have the structures within our community to do that, that person will have to be a media owner or some other person who is extremely rich. We have seen what has happened in places like Italy where this universally elected president has, by definition, to be somebody who is extraordinarily rich. Look at the American President. He is someone who needs to be extraordinarily rich or have rich and powerful friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate means that the president will not be a member of either of the major political parties. This person will be chosen in a bipartisan manner. The potential president will also be somebody who is looked upon in the light of the checks and balances which operate within this community and within this parliamentary process. It will also be somebody who then gets his or her power from the elected members of the parliament. The Australian citizens as a whole, who elect all of us here, then have their representation and can move the issue along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This notion of a people's convention is particularly extraordinary. Firstly I draw people back to the 1890s conventions which were proponents of change. They were concerned with only one question: how to create, from separate Australian colonies, a Commonwealth of Australia. More than half of the Australian population were non-participatory in that early people's convention. Most people will know that no female had any role in any of those conventions. Indeed, school children upstairs in the gallery may be interested to know that women were required to sit up there and watch the proceedings while the men decided what the Commonwealth of Australia was to be about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that a people's convention as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition would exclude women, but I do know that he is appointing half the delegates. In my summation, that means, `I have control of the numbers.' I find it quite extraordinary to dress this people's convention up as something which is open and free to all people if `I am appointing half the people'. To me, a convention is no sacred cow. I see the 1890s convention as having brought about the Commonwealth of Australia but having excluded me and all those other women who go to make up the other half of the Australian population. I look at the 1973-85 conventions in Australia and I see that none of them were able to come to any conclusion at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us here know the jokes about committees. I believe that the proposal for a people's convention on this issue represents the attitude: if you cannot come to a decision, you have a committee. Indeed, that is precisely the path which the Leader of the Opposition is taking. He cannot make a decision. He does not want an Australian to be head of state. He does not want Australians to determine who they are and where they are in the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an extraordinary state we have got ourselves into: we have a monarch in Britain making decisions about us when, in fact, in many aspects of our lives we no longer have very close ties with Britain. If an Australian were to be head of state in an Australian republic, it would not deny the fact that very many people in Australia trace their roots back to Britain&mdash;England, Scotland and Wales. Some of us trace our roots back to Ireland. Now, many Australians trace their roots back to other places which are much closer to home&mdash;the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, parts of eastern Europe, Romania, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those people claim Australia as their own and look to Australia and the Australian government to provide them with their own head of state in a system which gives them a say. Many people who have come to Australia's shores are being provided, through their taking up of Australian citizenship, with the right to vote for the first time in their lifetime. That is important; it is at the heart of representative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here representing people and offering leadership. We often hear tell of the role of the Prime Minister&mdash;about the need to lead our people, the need to offer direction. The Prime Minister of Australia is talking of an Australian head of state in order for all Australians to share a future together. But now, somehow, that is not about leadership but about telling people what to do. How far from the truth this is. Republicanism and an Australian head of state are simply saying to the world, `We are Australian, we rule ourselves, we make our own decisions.' Quite simply, in a society which espouses equality and diversity, how much more correct is it for us to have an Australian head of state?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of spurious arguments we have heard on the constitutional monarchy pale into insignificance when we look at the nature of the British monarchy and when we look at the kinds of checks and balances which operate within this parliament and within this parliamentary system to ensure that there is stability and representative government. I say to those opposite: if we are to take and if you are to take representative government seriously, then it is up to each and every one of us to represent quite clearly the views of the 70,000 or so people who are in our electorates&mdash;not our personal views on this matter, but the views across the spectrum of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I move about my electorate, I find that the majority of people are in favour of a republic and an Australian head of state. Some people are in favour of a republic but not a change in the flag. Some people are confused about the notion of a republic and some other symbols which go with that. Some people stand for the monarchy, although the number is very small and diminishing; by and large they tend to be somewhat more elderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young Australians and the young Australian population with whom I mix and meet have a very clear view about who they are, about the kind of government they want and about where they are going in the 21st century. They are joyful about the Sydney Olympics. They are joyous in the notion of being part of a great industrial democracy. They are joyous in being part of a country in which representative government gives them a whole range of opportunities, and checks and balances. They are joyful in the notion that at last there are people who will stand up and say, `Being an Australian is something of which to be proud.' This is unlike what happened in the 1950s and 1960s when people cringed over to Britain to seek their education, to seek their artistic talents, to seek publication for their works or whatever else. No, the height of joy is here in Australia in a dynamic community and in a healthy artistic society&mdash;a society which people can be proud of and in which opportunity is very much part of the role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the member for Forde (Ms Crawford), one can see that the republican debate has a long way to go. There will be plenty of time to debate the serious and important constitutional issues involved in the proposals for a republic. In my short contribution at this stage I do not want to delve too deeply into that, but I do want to ask a few questions about the methods and motives of the government in pursuit of its republic, particularly about the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To change the constitution it is necessary to go through all the formalities under section 128 of the constitution. This means that there must be a referendum proposal passed by a majority of this House and of the Senate, and that it must be put to the electors. It will only be passed if it is approved by a majority of electors in a majority of states and by an overall majority of electors voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Federation, some 42 proposals have been put to referenda, but only eight of those 42 have passed. None of the eight has involved major constitutional change. In fact all the larger proposals for change have failed. No proposal which has been seen by the smaller states as a threat to them has been approved in a referendum. Very few referendum proposals involving an increase in Commonwealth power have been approved by the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what is involved in a referendum proposal for Australia to become a republic, the changes involved to the Australian constitution are massive, even on a proposal that seeks to effect least change. In addition, it must be borne in mind that the Crown is also the symbol of each of the states. Each state has a constitution and, in order to change those constitutions, whatever is required under the respective state constitutions must also be gone through. In effect, in seeking for Australia to become a true republic, you are asking for seven sets of changes&mdash;all of them major&mdash;to be effected simultaneously. It would be very easy for such proposals to be defeated if there is any significant sector of the community which does not support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no referendum proposal passed since 1977. The most recent attempt, in 1988, failed because the proposals did not have bipartisan support. It is highly unlikely that any proposal put to a referendum would pass if it did not have the support of the major parties. It is highly unlikely that it would pass if it did not have the support of all of the states and, in particular, if it is seen as a threat to the smaller states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of that, one might wonder why the proponents of an Australian republic do not seek to make the issue a bipartisan one, because it is only if it becomes bipartisan that it will be approved. The Australian Labor Party has had the subject of an Australian republic as part of its platform since 1981. So far as I am aware, absolutely nothing was done between 1981 and 1992, except in 1987 when the platform was amended to set a target date of 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter seems first to have been raised by the Labor Party in the public arena during the 1992-93 election. It was raised in a very odd situation&mdash;obviously, a partisan situation where the parties were contesting an election. The Prime Minister came up with the extraordinary proposition that it would be good for the economy if Australia were to become a republic. I fail to see any relationship between the nature of the constitutional arrangement at the pinnacle of our government and economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that election, there commenced what was referred to&mdash;erroneously, in my belief&mdash;as the republican debate. It was somewhat pointless because it seemed to raise the question: do you want Australia to become a republic? If not, why not? It did not descend to the question: if yes, what sort of republic do you want? That debate went on, promoted by journalists, for some considerable time until April 1993 when the Prime Minister decided to appoint a Republic Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republic Advisory Committee might have promoted a bipartisan approach had the question of the appointment of the committee been approached by the Prime Minister in a bipartisan way, but it was not. He pointedly appointed a former Liberal Premier who was a pro-republican to the committee, invited the then Leader of the Opposition to nominate one person to a 10-person committee and required the states, each of which has a different and significant interest, to appoint one representing larger states and one representing smaller states. The result was that there was a committee which was seen right from the outset as being the subject of a partisan appointment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister seems to have thought it was also a relatively simple question to determine how to become a republic because he gave the committee a very short time frame within which to report. In fact, it could not report within that time frame and got a one-month extension. The government received the report in October 1993. The government then said, `Well, we won't be announcing what we are proposing immediately. We will do that early in 1994.' However, the Australian public waited in vain for the whole of 1994 for a government response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In October 1994, the coalition proposed that there be a people's constitutional convention convened in 1997. That would have been to consider, among other things, whether there should be a republic, and, if so, what form that should take. The response of the Prime Minister to that was hardly bipartisan. He was asked a dorothy dixer in question time in this House in November last year, to which he answered:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: the government will be holding no dialogue with the coalition until it declares a belief in the need for an Australian head of state&mdash;none whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you do not accept the need for an Australian head of state, there will be no constitutional convention and no contribution and attendance at it by us.</PARA>
<PARA>There the Prime Minister is foreshadowing what he sees as the simple question for the resolution of the republican question: do you want an Australian head of state? The republican debate will not, in my view, be advanced while arrogant, censorious comments of that sort emanate from the government and generate a partisan approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must not have found it very easy to develop a response to the Republic Advisory Committee report, because nothing emanated from the government until 7 June. So it took all of 18 months and heading towards the better part of two years for a response from the government. The timing of that really raises another question. The response was given at a time when there was frequent and loud talk of the prospect of an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response by the government, to promote a head of state elected by the houses of parliament jointly, is no doubt a valid proposal worthy of consideration by the Australian public in the course of the republican debate that will no doubt continue for some time. But there are partisan aspects to the proposal. First, the proposal does not deal with the situation of the states. It would be ludicrous to contemplate an Australian republic without the states being involved in the transformation from a monarchy to a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, in the context of public opinion, the proposal adopted runs strongly counter to the public's substantial majority view that the head of state should be elected by the people. Third&mdash;and I have already mentioned this&mdash;the response to the Republic Advisory Committee was not quick and it was not done in the course of 1994. The response from the government was not put until as late as this month in the context of a possible early election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of announcing the government's proposals, the Prime Minister also said that what we have is a simple question. He asserts that the only question involved in the republican debate is: do we want an Australian head of state? He camouflages the real issue, because in order to get a true Australian head of state&mdash;the Governor-General effectively being an Australian head of state&mdash;we have to ask how we get one. It is not, therefore, simply a question of: do you want an Australian head of state? It is: do you want an Australian head of state elected by the Australian people? Do you want an Australian head of state elected by the parliament? Do you want one appointed by the Prime Minister? Do you want one who is elected by the state governors, or is one of the state governors appointed to serve for a limited time, as has been seriously suggested?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. It seems to me to be highlighting the fact that this proposal is being put in an election context. The Prime Minister is reported by people in the press gallery as having said that he can win an election on the republic issue. If that is his attitude, I am very disappointed, because the issue is far too important to be treated like that. But so many signs are pointing to that being the way the Prime Minister in particular is approaching it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes I have left to speak I will contrast the coalition approach. As foreshadowed in October last year by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when he was the Leader of the Opposition, the coalition will, on being elected to government, convene in 1997 a people's constitutional convention. Half the delegates will be elected; half will be appointed. They will be elected on state and territory bases, with parliamentarians disqualified from running for election. The election process will recognise that young people, women and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds are currently underrepresented in decision making processes. Strenuous efforts will be made to encourage them to stand for election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining half of the delegates will be appointed from federal, state and territory parliaments. The Prime Minister, premiers, chief ministers and attorneys-general will be delegates. Federal and state oppositions will also be represented. There will also be representatives from local government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Ten per cent of those at the convention will be in the age group 18 to 25. If a consensus emerges from the people's convention as to what should be done about a head of state, the coalition has undertaken that that will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, who is at the table, asks me what I think. I am one of 17 million people. I believe, as the coalition does, that the question ought to be asked of the people, the issue debated at this convention and the consensus that emerges be put to a referendum. We have in contrast the government approach, which is that we as a government have decided what we want to do and we will tell the people that is what they have to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also provides for the possibility of there being no real consensus, just as there is in the community at the moment, on a particular form of republic. In that event the coalition would put a series of options to the people for them to vote on. Those options would be put in the form of a plebiscite, not a referendum, and if a consensus emerges from that it would be put to a constitutional referendum. That is a two-stage process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The virtue of the coalition approach is that the people will be consulted. It makes sense in the context of the need for a constitutional referendum, bearing in mind that so few constitutional referenda have been passed by the Australian people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is about time Australia had its own head of state. We are approaching the 21st century and our centenary of nationhood, and it is about time we made our own way in our region and in the world. At a time when we are attempting to become closer to our Asian neighbours through trade and culture, they are amazed that we still have a sovereign head of state who lives 10,000 kilometres away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these people are pretty amazed that, when the Queen of England visits Malaysia, for example, she is usually assisting or leading a delegation of English trade people who are working on trade balance for England&mdash;certainly not on trade balance for Australia. It is time we showed our own colours and our own way as a nation. The Queen of England has been with us for a long time, and it is now time we are able to elect our own Australian head of state. That is what this debate is really about: Australians having their own as the head of their nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queen of England in reality now only acts in her role as Queen of Australia when she is in Australia. That is not very often these days. Most of the time in touring other countries she is the Queen of the United Kingdom. When talking about those interests she is talking about the interests of England and the trade of England and the economies of the United Kingdom. That is fine. That is the way it should be for her as the head of England, but it should not be that way for the head of Australia. When we have a head visiting another part of the world that head of our country should be promoting this country, Australia. When our head of state visits those countries, it should be an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may ask why we have hung onto these remnants of the past for so long. There are a lot of reasons. Our history, our early European population, was British based. The economy was geared to the European market until relatively recently and certainly until postwar in Australia. Maybe it was tied too close, maybe we should have broken the ties earlier. Our population is English speaking, with an accent somewhat equivalent to cockney English. Therefore we were seen as an easy place for English migrants to settle. We do have some strong ties, and some of us have strong memories. My wife is English born, so my mother-in-law is English&mdash;a great woman. She came to live in Australia in 1983, was naturalised in 1984 and at 78 now firmly believes that Australia should have its own head of state, should be able to state its own case with its own head and should be proud of the fact that it has a head of state born and bred in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia's population has grown through its migrants, especially its postwar migrants, through those changes Australia has come away from the European economy. Many more nationalities have settled in Australia and we have changed from our early roots. Those changes in trade were very easy to see in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s when England went into the Common Market and basically destroyed the Tasmanian apple industry. It was the right thing for England to do but it certainly did not do anything for Australia's trade and it certainly did not do anything for a major industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In England now the Prime Minister is having a few difficulties in convincing his more conservative colleagues in his own party that England should be going into the European Union in a fully fledged way, as all the other nations are. That is probably right for England and that is probably where it should be in its trading bloc, endeavouring to gain the best out of that. But Australia's future is in the Asian region, the Pacific rim. That touches everything from South America to the Americas, North America and Canada right through Japan, right down to China, right around Asia and even across to South Africa and the Indian rim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have great trade opportunities emerging in those areas in the future. To make the most of them we need to have someone who can go there as the head of Australia, someone who is an Australian. I believe we will be seen to be a country that has finally reached its full maturity. Our early relationship with Britain, our heritage and our affection for that country do not need to change. We have grown up with them. I personally have many English friends who will not change a bit when Australia becomes a republic. They will still be my friends. I will still enjoy their company and be proud to know them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The head of state in Australia should embody and represent Australian values, traditions, experiences and aspirations for the future. We should incorporate the dreams and aspirations that the indigenous people of Australia have for our nation. I would like to see us becoming one Australia, but it will rely on a decision of the Aboriginal people&mdash;will they help us develop our nationhood in a way that is acceptable to their people? That is something that I do not think could ever happen under a head of state who was born somewhere outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every Australian should be able to aspire to be the head of state, chosen because of a particular achievement or outstanding service. There is no reason why we should not look forward to having an Aboriginal as the head of state some time in the future. Many Aboriginals have contributed to building our great nation, and many more will do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current constitution, the head of state is the Queen. Most of her responsibilities are carried out by the Governor-General. The only power she retains is the appointment of the Governor-General which, by convention, she does on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. The historical aspect of that is that in 1933 the Governor-General ceased to be the representative of the British government in Australia and became solely the representative of the Queen. In the same decade, it was accepted that the British monarch would act on the advice of the Australian government, not the British government. Also Australia assumed responsibility for its own external affairs&mdash;its foreign affairs as we call it today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London ceased. Australian courts became the ultimate arbitrator of Australian law. There has been a move towards our becoming a republic over the years, and we have divested ourselves of a connection to British law, its courts and its appeal system. In the Australia Act, the UK relinquished the last vestiges of power, making only Australian law apply to Australia&mdash;a small but important step and the last in a process which began about 100 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the minimalist approach, the only thing that we will need to change is the position of the Governor-General and how he or she is appointed. All the constitutional principles and practices will remain the same. The role of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be the same, and we will still have a federation of states. The functions of the head of state will be that of the Governor-General&mdash;except in the most external circumstances&mdash;although we will still have this ongoing debate about the reserve powers and that aspect of control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the polls have shown that within our country people would like to vote on the head of state. I think as we emerge from this debate&mdash;although I am sure there will still be a lot of debate before there is a referendum&mdash;people may come to realise that changing the way we elect the head of state from a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament would require a major change to the power structure that we presently have in this country. Hence, we would have to rewrite and change the power of the Senate. We would have to look at the power of the Prime Minister, the Executive Council and the executive government. A major change would have to take place, and that process would involve enormous changes to the power structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had a popularly elected head of state, we would need to change the power structures that we presently know in our country today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After eight accords over 12 years&mdash;each accord covers a period of about 1 1/2 to two years&mdash;with Accord Mark VIII we can see for the first time the development of a permanent perpetual wages system whereby, having used the accords to move away from the centralised wage fixing structure, we are now moving to a decentralised wage fixing structure. In that decentralised wage fixing structure, enterprise bargaining is growing apace throughout the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those working Australians who cannot avail themselves of an enterprise bargain will be protected by the safety net being proposed by the government. In other words, we have had accords which dealt with award restructuring and flexibility within awards and we have had accords which were predicated on the amalgamation of major unions under a system of award restructuring. That now largely having been accomplished, we can focus on a permanent wages system with low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine that it is a matter of some substantial comfort to the community that the ACTU, on behalf of the work force, said that, for the period of this Accord, the wages system will be based on an underlying inflation rate on average of two to three per cent over the cycle. I ran into an employer's representative yesterday and he said to me, `I grew up with automatic wage indexation. For my whole working life there has been automatic wage indexation.' To see an underlying rate of inflation of two to three per cent&mdash;in other words, running the wages system, including the enterprise bargaining stream to produce two to three per cent inflation&mdash;is a quite remarkable and revolutionary change. It means that we can run the Australian economy faster than we would otherwise be able to were we relying simply on interest rates to curtail inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those countries where we have seen only a reliance on fiscal and monetary policy we have generally seen a much slower rate of employment growth and economic growth than in Australia. Having the three instruments of policy&mdash;fiscal, monetary and wages policy&mdash;with some weight on each rather than a heavy preponderant weight on any one really means that we can run the economy much faster and more safely in terms of inflation and, at the same time, spread the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told the House last week that since 1983 we have had an increase in household disposable income of 40 per cent or, in per capita terms, an increase of over 19 1/2 per cent. There have been over two million jobs created. That is a fairly remarkable record. We have a system which takes account of the core need for competitiveness. We hear a lot from the opposition about the current account deficit. It is now the only thing that those opposite harp on.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no doubt that Accord Mark VIII is a framework for another four years of low inflation, high growth and high productivity for the Australian economy. It certainly continues our tradition of industrial harmony&mdash;the one we are so pleased and proud to boast about. And what better day to show it off than the day the ABS statistics have been released, showing that for last year, 1994, Australia recorded the lowest number of industrial disputes in any year since 1940&mdash;the lowest number of industrial disputes for 55 years. What a sensational performance!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just have a look at what we inherited in 1983 and compare it with what we have today as a result of the Accord. Here we have the graph. Here we have Everest. Who was presiding over the economy then? Who was right up there, scaling the dizzy heights? The Leader of the Opposition, the then Treasurer of Australia. His former Prime Minister has left the chamber, I notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are we today? Right down here, with the lowest level since 1940. These reductions have been even more dramatic as a result of the conjunction of the Accord process and the 1993 Industrial Relations Reform Act. It was only a few days ago that the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workforce</EMPHASIS> published an article dealing with this question of industrial disputes, days lost and protected bargaining. What it had to say is very revealing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workforce</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a legal right to strike has failed to produce an upsurge in industrial action, confounding employers' predictions that the new laws would create industrial turmoil. In fact, in the 12 months following the introduction of the new federal laws allowing unions to stage protected industrial action, the number of working days lost due to industrial action declined by more than 46 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It went down in that first year by more than 46 per cent! All of this is great news for Australian business. It is great news for Australia's exports. It is great news for Australia's economy. Of course, it is all thanks to the Accord and it is all thanks to those industrial reforms that this government has driven home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, under Labor, that exceptional performance will continue. Accord Mark VIII, after all, guarantees it. All working people in Australia have their standards fundamentally guaranteed through the four safety net adjustments provided under Accord Mark VIII, the $8 increase from Accord Mark VII and the three annual adjustments&mdash;$9 to $12 for each of the following three years, 1997 through to 1999. In the case of low paid workers, it is a bigger increase&mdash;from $11 to $14.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the budget, there is a better retirement income guaranteed under the Accord for all workers through the introduction of employee superannuation contributions, contributions which will be met, dollar for dollar, by this government. We have improved this area. We have driven home the reforms. We have provided additional assistance for families. We have a comprehensive package we can truly be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in stark contrast to the promise of what members of the opposition have in store if ever they are elected to government in this country. There is no comprehensive award safety net under them whatsoever. There is an absence of a no disadvantage test against which enterprise bargains can be measured. There are no safety net increases. There is a single miserable hourly rate of pay. How do we know this when there has been no release of the federal policy? It is worth noting that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition went to Queensland and released the Queensland state opposition's IR policy. It provided all of these things&mdash;each and every one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach of the opposition to industrial relations is no different now from what it was in 1993. It destroys all workers' protections. It would return us to the industrial turmoil, shown here so graphically, of the early 1980s.</PARA>

There has been a substantial distribution of the wealth in Indonesia. One can see the changes taking place there perpetually.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a continuing stream of proposals to loosen fiscal policy which keep coming from the opposition. We saw in the reply to the budget from the Leader of the Opposition that the opposition was determined to oppose various tax measures, which would have meant a loosening of fiscal policy to the tune of $1 1/2 billion this year and $2 1/2 billion the subsequent year. Since then the opposition has proposed one expenditure measure, that is, in relation to non-work related child care. Now we see another, in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The opposition is taking the view that various measures proposed by the government to stop the rapid growth of one of the fastest growing expenditure items in our whole array of outlays should be opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has taken the view that in regard to our attempts to clarify the eligibility criteria and to prevent various claims which have been made on the basis of an application of the law which we never intended, such as, for instance, to diesel fuel used in maintaining council parks and gardens or in quarrying activity, there should be no retrospective application of that legislation to prevent claims being made on a basis which the government never intended them to be made. That is, the opposition wants the companies which are making these claims to be able to get money out of the government on the basis of an application of the law which was never intended by the legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money involved in this is substantial. It is about $160 million, if all the court decisions were to go against the government. That is the amount of money at risk and that is the addition to outlays which would come from the opposition being successful in its attempts to prevent the government from restricting outlays in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not stop there. The opposition is also trying to prevent us from eliminating quarrying prospectively as an area which would not qualify for the diesel fuel rebate. That would cost an extra $20 million per annum approximately. So what we are looking at here is, across the forward estimates, something in the order of $240 million of additional outlays&mdash;that is, $160 million for the various claims and an annual $20 million for the inclusion of quarrying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that of the $160 million of claims, $90 million would go to three companies. Those three companies, of course, have charged their customers in the past for the full amount of their costs, including the diesel cost without the rebate. Do you think those companies are going to hand back the $90 million to their customers? If you do, you have another think coming. If you really believe that, you are totally naive. This will just be $90 million straight into the pockets of three companies, to their benefit and to the benefit of their shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have had in this budget debate so far is opposition members opposing outlays in the order of $400 million, and thereby trying to increase outlays to that extent. That is just on two measures&mdash;the only two outlays measures that have so far come before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we have this ranting from opposition members about the need to tighten fiscal policy. The fig leaf of respectability that they have had on this issue has produced this response: `You should not be doing it through tax measures; you should be doing it through outlays.' But that fig leaf has been torn away by your own actions, because you keep opposing the outlays measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The naked truth is that this is an opposition without any policy credibility whatsoever. This is supposedly the alternative government, but it totally lacks policy credibility. It is trying to have the argument at the macro-level by saying, `We support fiscal tightening.' At the same time, it is opposing all the measures at the individual level&mdash;even, incredibly, the outlays measures. How could anyone take such an opposition seriously? How could anyone believe that this is an opposition with credibility and decency and with any policy ideas? By God, you need that brainstorming session tomorrow.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly can. The Treasurer answered a question related to this, and I have further information. Although I am able to provide the honourable member information on the constant stumbling over the hurdles of this alleged opposition position, I said that we ought not to be addressing any element of the revenue side on this budget. We should, as they said, reduce expenditure significantly. Also, in a statement a week or so ago from the opposition spokesperson on treasury matters, it was stated that substantial massive measures were required in the expenditure area to address, in his terms, the current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a small piece of good news, but a small piece of good news only, for the Treasurer. His statement that every single item of expenditure restraint that had thus far gone before the parliament had failed in the Senate with the opposition opposing it has to be amended as from late last night. Their opposition to the changes in the export market development grants scheme pursued once through the Senate was not pursued a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having retreated in the face of the blandishments of the government in the course of the last week, Senator Parer could not let it go. He said in the Senate last night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would state on behalf of the coalition that, on election to government, the coalition would recognise tourism as our largest single earner of foreign currency; and it will give tourism the same access to export market development grants and to any other facilities as are applicable to any other industry. This is a coalition commitment which will be delivered; it is not an empty . . . promise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Parer had to say. That would constitute something like a 7 1/2 per cent increase in the expenditure in this area to provide opportunities for free tickets or subsidised holidays for foreign tourists coming to this country, as though an industry which is now upwards of about $7 billion actually requires the additional assistance that this proposition puts forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we had a detailed consideration of these matters&mdash;unlike the way the opposition makes policy&mdash;it was pointed out that all the funds and resources that were going into this area were, to a substantial degree, creating competition between particular tourist destinations, facilities and operators in Australia as opposed to enhancing tourism to Australia. The opposition nevertheless says, `In our giveaway show, we will whack in another 7 1/2 per cent there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular proposition comes on top of the opposition's propositions that we had occasion to mention here earlier in the week. The hurdle those opposite fell over&mdash;as opposed to how they stumbled, got up, ran round and jumped over again in the case of the export market development grants scheme&mdash;was in the area of the restriction to non-working mothers of a very generous 12 hours a week subsidised child care. The opposition spokesperson said that I had been mistaken. I turn now to the relevant press article, which has not been denied by the coalition. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition will go to the next election promising non-working mothers up to 50 hours a week subsidised child care.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition believes stay-at-home mothers should be entitled to up to $94 a week child-care assistance, even though they receive a $30 a week home child-care allowance to stay at home and care for their children.</PARA>
<PARA>That has not been denied by the opposition, and we costed it. The cost was $1 1/2 billion. It is a $1 1/2 billion promise that you find yourselves committed to. As far as the increased diesel fuel rebate outlays issue is concerned, which was referred to by the Treasurer earlier&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday night what was long overdue and was, according to Senator Alston, a step in the right direction, was, by Wednesday morning, according to the member for Bennelong, prejudiced, biased legislation and a dagger at the heart of Mr Packer. I am starting to feel a bit sorry for Senator Alston. Is it any wonder he gets tangled up when the opposition, after 12 years, still does not have a media policy? So is it any wonder that Senator Alston is getting confused?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only firm statement we have on cross-media owership from the opposition is the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to abolish the cross-media ownership rules. He thinks we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act&mdash;the Trade Practices Act that he weakened and the member for Holt had to strengthen. And when the member for Holt introduced the changes to strengthen it the Deputy Leader of the Opposition opposed the changes. So the Leader of the Opposition says that we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act, even after the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission says that means there are no limits on cross-media ownership.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When tax concessions were the order of the day there was only a 40 per cent coverage, and there is now a 90 per cent coverage.

On top of that, the thing that we did not promise people but happily have been able to give them is 15 per cent occupational superannuation by the year 2002 for the rest of their lives, so that no Australian will be able to go into retirement worried about their income. Also, in Accord Mark VIII, in this last week, we have seen the payment of decent increases under enterprise bargaining&mdash;and a safety net for those who cannot access it&mdash;of $10 to $12 a week, and $11 to $14 for those on awards only.</PARA>

To use military parlance, you have fired all those 25-pounders, but somehow or other none of them has hit their target. Let us go through them. You had the disaster of the Canberra by-election&mdash;it is a fascinating study in political combat and political science&mdash;that brought our colleague over here, the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), into the House. It was not just the average by-election swing; it was the biggest by-election swing in modern Australian political history. That was achieved in the heartland of a town that was regarded as welded onto the Labor Party and he secured a swing of 16.7 per cent. It was a very great result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the reaction of the government? The government said, `Right, we are going to take this seriously. We are now going to keep our nose to the grindstone. We are now going to govern in the interests of all the Australian people.' Do you know what it did? It produced the budget. The first shell out of the 25-pounder was the budget. That was meant to demolish the opposition. But, somehow or other, it did not quite work like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I smiled to myself today when the Prime Minister said that we would not let him into our confidence about what our policies were. I say to those sitting opposite: do you know that I knew what the government was going to do with the Commonwealth Bank a long time before you did? I, in fact, predicted what the government was going to do with the Commonwealth Bank the weekend before the budget. Do you know when you were told about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank? You were told at 6.30 on the night of the budget. You were told an hour before the budget was released when the Commonwealth Bank was going to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget did not quite hit the mark; something went wrong. Maybe the Australian people are a little cynical of somebody who for 12 years said that it is akin to burning down the gum tree to sell the Commonwealth Bank and then suddenly, because he wants the dough and nothing else, he marches in and says that it is an inspired piece of policy. That struck a very discordant note. The Australian people thought to themselves that that is not really fair dinkum. If the bloke was really opposed to selling the Commonwealth Bank, if he really believed in public ownership, if he really believed in the legacy of Ben Chifley, whether he needed the dough or not, he would have held onto the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>

We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the party political agenda and the election agenda. With a people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party would not have to say or do anything about the republic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House is debating a matter of public importance which relates to the failure of this Prime Minister to understand the concerns of Australians. His failure was revealed very starkly again during question time today. The Prime Minister said, on assuming the leadership of the Labor Party, `I will tell the truth.' He said at the time of the 1993 election, `What I am promising is not to put up taxes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers detail that real growth in taxation revenue will increase by 10.3 per cent this financial year, which finishes tomorrow. Next financial year there will be an additional increase of 9.3 per cent in the tax take. This federal Labor government continues to grab more and more by way of taxation. From Saturday 1 July, sales tax will go up. Not only will the rate go up but there are other factors involved as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to rate increases, it was revealed in the 1993 budget that the wholesale sales tax rate will jump from $435 million to $585 million to $1,207 million to $1,345 million over the four financial years to 1996-97. What we have is a government that is getting bigger and bigger on the backs of blue-collar workers. It is doing that in a very unfair, unjust and unreasonable way. It is getting bigger and bigger on the backs of families who are battling to survive in very tough economic times. If members would like an insight into this problem&mdash;and perhaps government members are so out of touch that they need to be reminded&mdash;I remind the House of what the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures said today in a survey report. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales manufacturers say they expect to shed about 2,600 jobs in the next 12 months because of a severe downturn in business, according to a survey released today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NSW Chamber of Manufacturers and State Bank June quarter survey found any improved conditions in early 1994 had evaporated and manufacturers put the blame on higher interest rates, increases in sales tax and a slump in the building industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NSW Chamber's chief executive, Philip Holt, said the survey highlighted the difficulties facing the manufacturing sector.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen said the survey showed a clear downturn in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from the real world where Labor members hesitate to venture. That article was about a survey released today. I want to examine the government's lack of performance and take up another challenge of the Deputy Prime Minister. He was extolling the virtues of the government's frontbench team. I concede that sometimes those of us in the lower house forget to look across the corridor to the Senate and to examine the other portion of the Labor government's frontbench team&mdash;the Senate ministerial team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we examine the monumental lack of leadership coming from this government, what do we find? The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is enduring his worst fortnight ever in politics. He is enduring it through dint of his own lack of effort over a range of issues. If you want a manifestation of what the government thinks of Senator Gareth Evans, may I remind you of what happened last week. You will recall that the government altered by 24 hours the date of election of the new deputy of the Labor Party when the member for Batman (Mr Howe) suddenly handed in his resignation to ensure that Gareth Evans was caught overseas and was unable to attend the caucus meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Evans has really failed with regard to French nuclear testing. The way in which he failed to raise our concerns in key correspondence was shameful. His response to the decision of President Jacques Chirac has been weak; it has been late; it has been timid; and it has been lacking in leadership. As a consequence of that and other factors, we face the prospect of some horrific French nuclear testing in the next 12 months in the Southern Hemisphere. Minister Gareth Evans has failed again with regard to a certain matter involving Australia and Indonesia. I will not dwell on that due to time constraints, but it is there to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then you might turn to the magnificent Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). Do you remember Rosemary Crowley? Have any of you heard of Minister Rosemary Crowley? She got so excited a couple of Christmases ago that she tried to cut out Christmas carols. That was the sort of leadership she provided to the Senate and the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, we have the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan). He really is in the B-grade team. Yesterday, he was very effectively exposed in an article which showed that he has totally got the APEC strategy wrong. As a consequence, he has run up the white flag on a key dimension of Australian trading policy. He has left Australia exposed in what is a very unlevel international playing field. The coalition recognises that and has developed policy to respond to that. The government's Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, still cannot get it right with respect to a non-discriminatory approach with regard to APEC and future trading arrangements and a discriminatory trade approach. </PARA>

I think it is the height of arrogance for the Leader of the Opposition to come into this House with an appalling economic record from his own time in opposition and make these charges against the Prime Minister. It is even more arrogant coming from a man who cannot even bring himself to countenance an Australian as an Australian head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition completely forfeits any right to speak on this particular matter of public importance before the House today. He has levied the charge against the Prime Minister and the government that the Australian people are coming second under the Prime Minister's stewardship. Is he talking about the long-term unemployed, who have been the recipients of the caring resources that have been put at their disposal to bring them back into the work force by the Prime Minister and the government through the Working Nation program? Is he talking about the Aboriginal people, who can now walk with pride in the wake of the Mabo legislation, which has been brought to this House by the government and opposed at every step by a weak-kneed leader who could not keep the rednecks in Western Australia under control?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is he talking about the pensioners whose living standards have increased over the past 12 years?

Are they the people who are coming second under the stewardship of the Prime Minister and the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let people in this House have no illusion about the leadership qualities of the people who lead the government and the opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong refuses time and time again in this House to answer the challenge of the government to table the policies of the opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know exactly how the Leader of the Opposition is handling the policy debate. It was done in Victoria by Jeff Kennett. Kennett made a promise to the Victorian work force and to individuals, families and communities that are the subject of this MPI here today. He made the promise that no worker would be worse off when the Kennett government came to power. After a massive assault on the social wage and on the living standards of workers, represented by an increase in taxes of $1,200 per family, we finally found out the real policies and the real agenda of the opposition. It gets worse than that because the honourable member for Bennelong will not even tell his own backbenchers. How can you hold a brainstorming session when you have nothing on the table and you will not even tell your own backbench what the policies are?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is a family man. He has successfully raised a family of four while devoting his political life to the welfare of the working people of this nation. What possible construction could the opposition put on this MPI accusing the Prime Minister of causing pain to Australian families and Australian communities? During his whole political life, the Prime Minister has been the architect, the weaver of the fabric, of the social wage, which has been the rock of support on which low income earners and working families have pinned their hopes for a decent standard of living in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, because of the efforts and the leadership of the Prime Minister, is acknowledged as being one of the great social democracies in the world. That has been the hallmark of the Prime Minister's life&mdash;an untiring and unswerving dedication to the improvement of the living standards of all Australians. That concern was reflected in the budget that he, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) crafted recently, which was delivered to the Australian people and the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government delivered a prospect of economic security taking us beyond the year 2000, a gross domestic product improvement of 3 3/4 per cent, business investment rising by 13 per cent, employment growth of three per cent, over 240,000 jobs, a fall in the unemployment rate, an increase in the real disposable household incomes of people, continued low levels of inflation and decreasing interest rates. Are these the hallmarks of a government that is attacking the working families of this nation? While I am on the subject of families, I say that we introduced a range of measures designed specifically to improve their living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the prince of pain? What of the Leader of the Opposition, whose record in office condemns him in the eyes of every economic commentator and in the eyes of the Australian people? While he wines and dines with the desperate tories of the Melbourne Club, he ought to tell us about the pain working families would have suffered by virtue of getting a miserly $16 rise over the last 12 years. While he sits on the cocktail circuit on the North Shore, he might tell the working people of this nation how he plans the most massive assault on their wages and conditions with the aiding and abetting of his state leaders in New South Wales and elsewhere around this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister of this country has constructed a social wage which has supported the working people of this nation. But the Leader of the Opposition has a record where, over his time in office, that social wage declined by 17.5 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested in what the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) had to say. As I said earlier, we have heard him say this a few times earlier today. I think the member for Flinders is trying to get us to believe the old saw that one swallow makes a summer. But the real part of that saw was that one swallow does not make a summer. The member for Flinders says he has found one instance in the years between 1988 and now in which we have had question time on a day when parliament has sat after the normal time. He found one precedent. That is one time we have done it. There have been many times in the past when we have not done it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the member for Flinders ought to remember, and what the Australian public should know, is that the only reason we will be here tomorrow spending the Australian taxpayers' money is the slothfulness, laziness and downright opportunism of his colleagues in the Senate. In his remarks, he said that we will be here tomorrow only for a clean-up operation. That is right. The reason the House is sitting tomorrow is that the Liberal and National senators, at the behest of their leader and the member for Flinders, will not do their job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They spent the first part of this week mucking around with everything, and most of last week just talking about their own internal problems. We had a three-quarter of an hour diatribe one day from Senator Crichton-Browne on why the member for Flinders, as deputy leader, was no good and how he was going to see the member for Flinders off. This is the way the National Party and the Liberal Party want to spend time wasting the taxpayers' money in the Senate. So the House of Representatives has to sit another day to wait for important legislation to come back. We are here tomorrow because of the outright laziness and stupidity of opposition senators in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is unfortunate that we have to be here tomorrow. Obviously, if members from both sides were not here tomorrow they would be able to do things in their electorates, which, I am sure, their constituents would prefer they did. The member for Flinders says that we should go back to the good old days when former Prime Minister Fraser was sitting in the chair that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) is sitting in. Unlike the member for Flinders, because he was never actually here when Mr Fraser was Prime Minister,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall Mr Fraser being here as Prime Minister. For anyone to suggest that he spent a lot of time in this chamber answering questions is a joke. What Prime Minister Fraser used to do was to turn the Prime Minister's chair 90 degrees so that his back was turned to Speaker Snedden, whom he despised, and he would then look around the chamber. When a member of the opposition asked him a question, he would point to one of his blockheaded ministers, and that minister would get up and answer the question&mdash;not the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were in opposition, we used to say, `We want to hear from the butcher, not the block.' But every time a question was asked, the block would get up and answer the questions because the butcher would just sit here. They were all dead scared of him. But he was never going to answer questions. So I do not think any of us would like to go back to the good old days of Prime Minister Fraser who treated the parliament with an arrogance that we had never seen before and will never see again. </PARA>

Although it is a quite expensive exercise, I believe it is a very generous gesture and I am very supportive of it.

We are asking that this government conduct the orders of the day in the proper and traditional fashion, and that is by including question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, as it is certainly not one of the Prime Minister's rostered days off, we would like to think he will give this place the courtesy of attending with his full frontbench. After all, we are going into recess and it seems to me it would be a particularly good time for the Prime Minister to set an example for us for when we all come back. He should, firstly, attend with his full frontbench and, secondly, answer at least one question in a manner that might be understandable to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time is not, as the Prime Minister previously described it, a privilege extended to the coalition or the opposition by the governing executive. It is a process by which the government of the day, whatever its political persuasion, is kept honest and answerable to the people of Australia. That is what it is there for. As such, every day this House sits, the government has a responsibility to the people of Australia to extend that privilege to them so they can go to bed at night with some confidence that the government has been put under proper scrutiny and is conducting its affairs in an acceptable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Flinders (Mr Reith) took great pains to point out the growth in our debt and the substantial speculation in the community, the business community and the financial community that we will have another massive blow-out in the figures when they are announced tomorrow. One would have thought that the Prime Minister of the day would be concerned enough to come in here and explain this in the parliament to the Australian people. That, to me, makes sense and is proper. I would like to underline the word `proper' because that is what we are talking about: the proper process in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process has been driven into the ground. One of the ways that has been done is through this constant process of rewriting history. We cannot rewrite history in this place because it is all on the record. The government whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), just made a statement that Malcolm Fraser had a practice in this place whereby he referred all questions delivered to him to his frontbench. I was here for 2 1/2 years of that period and I remember that happening once. What I do not remember happening is a question being directed to a frontbencher and the Prime Minister showing so little confidence in that person as to take the question himself, which I have observed on numerous occasions here since Mr Keating has been the Prime Minister. He has shown an absolute lack of confidence in his ministers and has taken questions himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ministers sitting at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), might have suffered that ignominy on one occasion.

We went to an election where the choices were very clear. One party was saying, `Here are 601 pages of how the taxation system will work.' It was balanced and it was neutral. The other party went to the election and said, `You don't want any of that. It is terrifying and horrifying, but we can provide you with tax cuts without any change in the taxation system.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's inquiry into the work force of the future has reviewed demographic and labour market trends to draw attention to the future challenges and possibilities for Australia. Challenges and possibilities have been forced upon us by changes in demography, technology and the development of a global market, a market without frontiers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be futile for governments to fight rearguard actions against change, but there can be substantial benefits in seeking to understand the directions where already apparent trends are leading. The committee's report on the work force of the future examines demographic, economic and labour market developments and makes recommendations for government to assist workers and employers to adapt to structural and social change. The past 21 years have been marked by striking changes in the composition of the Australian labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For reasons that are not entirely clear, the year 1974 stands out in international labour force statistics as marking a sudden end to what has been called `the golden age of full employment' which ran for 30 years from the end of World War II. A variety of explanations have been put forward including the impact of the oil shock of 1973; general use of the contraceptive pill, which changed the whole pattern of fertility and led to increased female labour force participation; a loss of confidence in government intervention, Keynesian style, in the economy, leading to a revival of neoclassical economic theory and practice; and a clear indication of the post-industrial phenomenon with sharp declines in manufacturing employment, now down to 14 per cent, and demand for manual labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before 1974 Australia's unemployment rate was one of the world's lowest, far lower than that of the United States or Britain. Since 1974 it has generally been higher than that of the US, and sometimes higher than that of Britain. However, our wage levels have maintained value better than in the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee emphasises that the composition of the 1995 labour force is radically different from that of 1974. Since 1974 female participation in the labour force has increased from 41 to 51 per cent. The post-war Beveridge-Chifley concept of full employment being defined as `one adult breadwinner per family' has been overtaken by events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important development has been the growth of part-time work. In 1973 only 12 per cent of workers were employed part time. By 1993 this had doubled to 24 per cent. A high proportion of part-time jobs are performed by young people between 15 and 24 years of age and by married women. The number of jobs created in Australia between 1973 and 1993 was 1.8 million, or a growth of 32 per cent. However, over a million of those jobs were part time, which was an increase of 164 per cent in part-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Largely due to these factors, Australia, in common with most OECD nations, is now experiencing the unprecedented phenomenon of high employment and high unemployment simultaneously. It sounds like a contradiction in terms. All it means is that many of those, mostly males, who were traditionally in work are now out of it and unlikely to return while those, mostly women, who were traditionally not in work are now in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the high employment-high unemployment paradox, the age and gender composition of the labour force has changed dramatically. So has the length of working life, at a time of increasing life expectancy in Australia and most comparable economies. The 35-year working lifetime is likely to become the norm, replacing the 50-year model. Many more jobs have been created but, at the same time, labour force participation rates have never been greater. At 63.7 per cent, they have stayed close to their historic highest levels since 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the composition of the labour force has changed, a revolution in the work force has also occurred. Far more people work with telephones and computers than with traditional tools. Technical innovations have transformed every area of work from manufacturing processes to transport, warehousing and retailing, transforming the range of tasks performed. The regional impact of employment changes is extremely varied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with changes to tools and techniques, there have been far reaching shifts in the leading employment sectors in Australia. Since 1974, the fastest growing employment sector has been the information related employment sector&mdash;including the whole range of media and entertainment, market research, consulting, administrative, management, clerical, education and financial services. This sector is estimated at 42.5 per cent of the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fastest growth has been in domestic and quasi-domestic work including `hospitality' and tourism, essentially paralleling work which used to be carried out at home without a wage. These sectors between them now employ the bulk of services employment. Services in total comprise 79 per cent of the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These developments have been lost in the statistics produced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The committee accordingly recommends that the government request the Australian Bureau of Statistics to review the appropriateness of its existing data collection methodology and to indicate significance of information and domestic or quasi-domestic service employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took on Peter Drucker's important argument about the decline of hierarchical work, that management structures have been flattened out. He argues that the coming post-industrial society is `the first in which not everybody does the same work. This is far more than a social change. It is a change in the human condition'. In a knowledge society, having a hundred or a thousand people performing the same task, as was characteristic of agriculture or manufacturing, would be pointless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also drew attention to the formation of dual labour markets. The primary labour market is characterised by high skill levels, comparative security of employment and a full range of award related working conditions. The secondary labour market may be characterised by insecure work, low skill levels and a deteriorating range of award coverage. There is also increased wage disparity between the primary and the secondary labour markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic services and tourism and hospitality sectors are where most new jobs are now being created. Some 55 per cent of all work is estimated to be unpaid or informal work, once almost exclusively done by women, now increasingly outsourced. Evidence to the committee indicated that an additional two million potential jobs were waiting to be created by outsourcing services such as food preparation and delivery, home maintenance and gardening, cleaning, security and child minding. Of course, such outsourcing would be dependent on the restoration of the two income family with higher levels of discretionary spending. Australia is now exporting a range of services, including tourism, educational, financial, legal, marketing and management consultancy services. But we still import more services than we export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas where employment growth and wealth generation may be expected to occur include a number of industrial sectors such as construction, mining and value added manufacturing, together with agriculture&mdash;especially value added horticultural exports&mdash;information technology, knowledge related information services, health related services and tourism. The unprecedented growth of the information and quasi-domestic services sectors of the economy has led to the displacement of one group of workers and its replacement by another group. There is now a relatively high demand for skilled and professional workers and a relatively low demand for unskilled workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Across a wide variety of white-collar occupations, new computer technology enables some workers to attempt more creative or intellectually demanding tasks. There are now fewer opportunities for process related and middle management white-collar workers. During the 1980s, for example, many traditional clerical jobs have been lost in the banking and financial sectors, but now new financial products are creating employment downstream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been high growth in the low skilled part-time hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy. Structural award conditions in these industries have resulted in substantial cost advantages for the employment of part-time labour. In 1993 nearly 80 per cent of all part-time workers were employed in services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes outlined in the committee's report have caused substantial dislocation in the lives of many workers. The challenge for any government is to ease the impact of the process. As we said in paragraph 1.21, recognising that outsourcing will be a major contribution to employment, the committee recommends the government examine measures which may facilitate tendencies to outsource work from the home, government administration and industry, including primary industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is general agreement on the part of political parties, employer groups, trade unions and industrial tribunals on the basic objectives of work force change, but not the same degree of consensus on the range of measures needed to improve Australia's penetration of global markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we wrote in paragraph 2.31, one of Australia's greatest economic problems, although insufficiently recognised, is the inventory problem. This is the conspicuous lack of an inventory of brand name goods for which there is international recognition and demand, leading to a willingness to pay a premium price. Canada also lacks such an inventory, which is in significant contrast to Sweden, with Volvo, Saab, SKL and L. M. Ericsson; Finland, with Kone and Nokia; the Netherlands, with Philips and Shell; and the Republic of Korea, with Hyundai, Gold Star and Daewoo. All of those countries have such an inventory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already pointed to the tendency towards labour force demarcation between high skilled jobs with high pay and low skilled jobs often with low pay. High skilled jobs require an educated work force that is adaptable and flexible and which can acquire new knowledge quickly. Not all workers can possess those qualities. Governments must ensure that those who do not are not marginalised and are provided with opportunities to participate in the economy in a productive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to information technology for all is essential if Australia is not to be divided into the information rich and the information poor. The committee repeats its 1991 recommendation that the government adopt a national information policy which sets out a series of principles which anticipates the social, economic and cultural implications of the information revolution rather than having decisions made piecemeal, on the run, responding to situations such as the adoption of new technologies or changes in ownership suddenly arising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes that those countries which have moved to a high-tech knowledge based economy have also been most successful in creating employment. According to EPAC and the Hilmer report, at present Australia's efficiency levels in the business sector are 10 to 15 per cent below the average for OECD countries, and the average Australian enterprise operates at 30 per cent below world best practice. It is recognised that the priority for industry must be to improve competitiveness and productivity in order to succeed. At the same time, Australia must stimulate market demand for its goods and services by building up a high value added inventory. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the valedictory nature and atmosphere for me after&mdash;I might tell the chairman&mdash;42 1/2 years in the work force, I would like to pay a tribute to the chairman of the committee. This is not just a formality; it is my deeply felt attitude. At all times, since the committee was created five years ago this month, the chairman has sought, and I believe has always obtained, a parliamentary attitude to whatever subject we were studying. This may not mean much to new people in the parliament but, before the present government assumed office, all parliamentary committees decided by themselves what they would report upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Hawke allowed this committee to be independent, and we have chosen our own references in the last five years. I believe that the quality of our reports reflects this. I believe that, in the next parliament, whoever wins&mdash;I will not be here&mdash;will come back to the position that parliamentary committees should always report on what they believe is significant, not what has to be referred to them by this chamber, therefore the government, or by a minister in charge of a subject, which we have had in other committees I have served on&mdash;with disastrous effects, I must say. I hope there is a change in committee attitudes in the next parliament. No government can survive if it determines what parliamentary committees shall talk about.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the concept of mandatory retirement . . . be abolished, but that voluntary retirement for both males and females should be possible without reference to gender differentiation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very significant point to be made. The other point to be made is in recommendation 7.42, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that policies be developed to recognise the significance of the `third aged', to assist them to maintain their independence outside institutions as long as possible, and to promote the contribution of volunteers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, I spoke to a motion moved by the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). In the course of my speech I detailed the extraordinary difficulty I was having in getting any information at all with respect to a particular government program operating in my electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I subsequently received a message, taken in my office, at 3 o'clock this afternoon, from a Ms Susan Smith, who I understand works in the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon).

It is quite clear that the French do not consider those protests to be of any significance whatsoever. </PARA>

In fact, for a long time, Australians have enjoyed a fair amount of popularity when the subject of Australia and Australians has been raised amongst ordinary French people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a tremendous opportunity for the protests of the Australian community to be brought home not just at the very high level of President Chirac and the French government but also more closely and more directly to the French people themselves. In view of this high standing that Australians have enjoyed, and the tremendous standing in which Australian sports men and women are held by the French community, and reflecting on the contribution made by Australian servicemen and servicewomen during the First World War and the Second World War on French soil, one can see that there is an opportunity for the Australian government to initiate a comprehensive program within France itself of informing the French people of the opposition of the Australian people to these tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view, on a positive note, that the Australian government could do this by initiating a program of public relations within the French media, both print and electronic, to show just how strongly the Australian people feel about the tests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I too wish to speak briefly in regard to the French nuclear tests in the Pacific and the reaction to that announcement in my electorate of Bass. There is no doubt that the will of Australians is starkly against the resumption of this testing. A rally was held in Civic Square, Launceston last Saturday against the resumption of these tests. At this rally I circulated a petition with the following wording:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the widespread community outrage throughout our nation at the decision of the French government to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to note and endorse the concerns expressed in this petition and convey to the French parliament in the strongest terms Australia's opposition to this decision. We ask further that the House call upon the government of France to reverse its position and abandon completely any further nuclear tests in the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>That petition, with its 312 signatures collected in a very short time at that rally, has been submitted by me today and will be tabled in the House at our next sitting. That rally and this petition were things which united all political interests in Launceston. The rally itself was organised by the Tasmanian Greens and, although Bob Brown's speech was a plea to elect him to the Senate, at least it was an issue which he cared about and which Launceston cared about. </PARA>

It appears to me to be a mechanism by which the wages of the average Australian will be driven down. We continuously hear the phrase `world best practice' in this place and in other places. Quite frankly, world best practice is South American and South African wage levels. A lot of people that are imposing this upon us are companies and corporations that have mines in South Africa, employing South Africans who come over here, and South American companies that are now operating in Australia. When people talk about world best practice and they put into effect mechanisms such as the EBOs, may the Lord help the workers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state, we have already seen massive strikes. We have seen the worst strike in the last 20 years in the sugar industry and the worst strike in the last 20 years in the mining industry. These were through EBOs. Disruptions are taking place. In Queensland we have seen average weekly earnings go down in the last three years, which is probably the first time since the Second World War. They were already the lowest in Australia. Queensland is particularly susceptible to the deregulatory policies of this government. A statutory marketing authority as an arrangement is an industrial award for farmers. We have seen those smashed to pieces right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at these wonderful, clever people who are imposing this bill upon the Australian public. All of the conditions, pay and arrangements that have been fought over for 20, 30, 40, maybe even 100 years of Australian history are being swept away. Statutory marketing of wool was swept away and we saw the income from wool drop from $6,000 million a year to about $2,500 million a year. We lost $3,200 million per year in the wool industry alone, including about a third of our wool growers. The nation's greatest asset was the sheep herd, and now a third of that asset has gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of the economy we deregulated was petrol marketing. It was estimated by the MTAQ at one stage that around 500 service stations a year were closing. Most certainly, over 1,000 service stations and small proprietors went broke and went out of business in that period of time. So the small businessmen were wiped out and, as a result, the oil companies had a far greater grip on the Australian marketplace. The net result has been that, although the world price of oil has dropped by half, the price in Australia, in the same period of time, has more than doubled. That is costing the Australian public about $5,400 million per year every year&mdash;another great victory for deregulation. </PARA>

Compromise is what the other side is required to do to make a democracy work, but what the greens do only as a temporary measure to allow the regrouping of troops and energy. These are the words of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> editorial, but I thoroughly agree with them.

This year's topic was `Australia's future as a prosperous multicultural society depends on the development of a new national ethos'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference to traditional Australia and the distinguishing spirit which embodied the population conjures images of survivors, people who would continue struggling against the elements. National pride resides with explorers, pioneers and those who fought for Australia's independence, providing the romantic yet tragic picture of those at Gallipoli who were willing to die for their mates. On these qualities has Australia been built and to the courage and personality of previous populations we owe our modern lifestyle as we know it. Success and prosperity has been achieved through not simply the battlers, but their unifying distinctive disposition which forces future generations to acknowledge the presence of and benefits of emulating such traits.</PARA>
<PARA>Quenton continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of a changing society, resulting alterations to ethics and standards, and new international directions, one significant aspect of Australia's population is multiculturalism and the continuing expansion of this trend. This raises intriguing issues such as whether the traditional Australian ethos still exists and functions in a modern urban, multicultural society, whether the state of our society dictates the need for a reviewed and updated ethos or whether the individual successfully contributes to the nation's prosperity without the need for a linking characteristic between races, religions and cultures.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that all young Australians are thinking about their future and where Australia is headed. Their opinion should be sought by many people within this place. I try to do that. I have a youth advisory committee in Cowan. Quenton continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The diversity of cultures present in Australia's society has led to governmental policies granting equality as a right all citizens should be able to claim. This played a significant role in improving the attitudes of society towards all races, most significantly towards Australia's indigenous people, the Aborigines. An increased awareness towards inter-racial relationships helps towards a peaceful established level of functioning in which society should be a representation of national law.</PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, I guess should note those words. Quenton continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of Australia's society has seen new racial awareness, granted new opportunities to Aborigines and all non-Europeans, with new steps in land rights and the scrapping of the white Australia policy. Future change will have its greatest chance to work for the good of the society if the traits on which the nation was built are not denied. The utilisation of national standards, practices and ethics to incorporate all cultures is a challenge which must be acted upon by each member of society if they desire to create a functioning and thriving basis from which Australia's future will not be constricted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rising to speak today on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder. There are years in which I personally have fought shoulder to shoulder with the environment movement on the Ben Lomond uranium mine. I think that my involvement in the fight over getting on stream the big uranium mine at Ben Lomond was instrumental in stopping it from coming on stream. There were a number of actions by the French mining company which reflected the same sort of attitude that the French are showing now. In fact, the manager at Ben Lomond resigned at the time over the irresponsible attitude of the French mining company at Ben Lomond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fought alongside the environment movement again in the area of North Queensland which is very similar to the situation of Lake Pedder, the Downey Creek area. I thought that it was very wrong to log what was a virgin rainforest area, and I fought very hard and publicly against my own government to try to stop the logging at Downey Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions in the past I have found myself involved on that side. I had a lot to do with a lot of the people in the environmental movement when we instituted the first stand-alone solar energy system on Coconut Island in the Torres Strait. The town there was, in my day, totally looked after by solar energy. I supported that not because I wanted to be particularly clever or imaginative, but just because it happened to be the cheapest way of doing it. The incoming state government spent $8 million more of the taxpayers' money to put in the primitive diesel generators throughout the rest of the Torres Strait, and set this country back some 20 years in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But increasingly, now, the environmental movement seems to be taking an extreme position that takes no cognisance of the destruction wrought upon the rest of the community. It takes no cognisance of the pain imposed upon literally millions of people in Australia who cannot find a permanent job. I quote from the book by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), not from my own fund of knowledge. He says the real unemployment figure is 16 1/2 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Fraser showed a lot of courage and integrity in taking the position he did in his very outstanding book; and once again, even though he is known as a very strong environmentalist, he has taken a very strong and courageous position here. It is one of considerable integrity. Obviously there are no votes for him in Canberra in making the decision this way, whereas there might have been a few if he had gone in the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to drain Lake Pedder takes away the one advantage poor little Tasmania has got. When members go through all of the poverty indicators, as I did this week, Queensland leaps out in front on almost every single example; but undoubtedly Tasmania is neck and neck with Queensland in the poverty stakes for Australia, and this would take away from this little island state one of the great advantages that is has. The electricity system is really something that the rest of the world should look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to a person who is very high up in the electricity industry in Queensland. I cannot mention his name, because he would probably get sacked if I did. He said to me, `I'm completely out of line with the electricity decision makers throughout Australia. I believe small is beautiful, not big is beautiful; but I wouldn't expect you to understand that.' I said, `On the contrary, I went to Tasmania and I was absolutely staggered. As you drive along there is a one-megawatt generator here, a three-megawatt generator there, and a five-megawatt generator there.' In Queensland, anyone who talks about anything under 250-megawatt generators is regarded as a Martian. I am quite sure that that would be the same in Victoria or New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to the aluminium smelter there, and the people there were telling us all about how it operates. I said, `But what if you have a strike or some disruption to your electricity supply?' The people of Brisbane went for two weeks without a power supply until we had to go in and do what was a very dirty job&mdash;one of the ugliest jobs that I have ever had to do&mdash;and sack half the industry to get the power turned back on in Brisbane. I said, `What happens if you have a stoppage?' and they said, `We do not have those here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A system comprising hydro-electric generators, the biggest of which is 40 megawatts, is a system that is almost unassailable by anyone. An oppressive government might want to use electricity to raise finance. For example, the Queensland government has done this through a sneaky little trick: it has added two per cent taxation on electricity. It has been the only government in Australia to do that. But that is centralised control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Solar energy has such great appeal to so many people because it is a freedom thing. People can rig up their tents anywhere they like and they do not have to worry very much about anyone else. The cost of the excessiveness of the environmental movement is graphically illustrated by this ridiculous proposal. In North Queensland, at the present moment, there is a good chance that we will never get 1,500 jobs: there is the Rainbow Harbour project; the Palm Cove project; the East Trinity Inlet project; and one other project, which I cannot remember. There are four in Cairns. In my own electorate, south of Cairns, there are 250 jobs at Clump Point, 30 at Mission Park, 70 at Kirrima, 1,100 at Port Hinchinbrook, 40 at Dungeness, and 70 at Secret Harbour. That is a grand total of 3,000 jobs that these people are costing us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know of a single valid environmental issue associated with any single one of those projects. The actions of people in the environmental movement are becoming wildly excessive and the pendulum is swinging wildly against them. In fact, I think they take very great risks when they go into certain areas now in North Queensland because the level of hatred has got quite out of control against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to Herberton where World Heritage has taken away all the forestry jobs. There were 23 people in the pub that night and not a single one of them had a job in Herberton. These people are trying to feed their kids. They have no family life. The jobs have been taken away from them by people who are indulging themselves with excessive behaviour. This is illustrated graphically by this rather outrageous proposal to drain Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the demonstration at Port Hinchinbrook where 1,000 people paraded down the main street, I was on a backhoe with a fellow whose brother had bought two pieces of machinery to operate at Port Hinchinbrook. He was looking down the gun barrel of bankruptcy. This particular bloke had lost his job. It had been taken away from him because of the cutbacks on main roads by the Queensland government and by the federal government. The week before that he had a job with his brother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are just average working class, if people like to use that term, Australians. They are the battlers out there who are trying to have a go. The federal government is listening to outrageous people and it is costing this country dearly in every single way&mdash;for example, in the current account deficit. This is very relevant to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is the heartland of the fish and prawn farming industries of Australia. The comparable countries of Taiwan and Japan are looking at $2,000 million and $3,000 million a year of production from their prawn and fish farming industries. When I became northern development minister, there was not a single prawn or fish farm operating in Queensland and, as I understand it, in Australia. I am proud to say that we have leapt ahead. I do not want to claim the credit there. The person responsible for getting the industry going was the appointee of the present government, Dr Joe Baker. He was an outstanding appointment to Landcare and I must praise the current Keating government for appointing him to that position. By the time we were finished, from a standing start, within about seven or eight years, we were bringing in $30 million or $40 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now some $40, $50 or $60 million should be coming in and only about $25 million&mdash;I think that would be a fair figure&mdash;is coming in from prawn and fish farming. The reason for that is that every single attempt to build a pond in North Queensland has been opposed by the green movement and the green movement has been listened to by government decision makers. When I say `government decision makers', that would be the most ridiculous exaggeration that I have made in this place because any relationship between them and decision making would be purely coincidental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has absolutely no ability to make decisions. The present Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, has absolutely no ability to make decisions. All I can say is, please do not sack Senator Faulkner, because he is the greatest asset we have in Queensland. We can win votes from him all over the state. The fact that the split in the polls in Queensland is 62 to 38 reflects the attitude of the working class to a government that will listen to academics from the universities in Queensland and layabouts on fat government jobs in the cities but will not listen to people living in the areas concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could count the number of green movement people living in my electorate on the fingers of both hands. They do not live in the area, nor do they live in the bush, as I have all my life. People living in my electorate live in these areas because they love the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision makers come from cities like Townsville, Brisbane, Canberra and Sydney. They do not live in the bush. The fact that the vast population of Queensland lives in areas like my own means that the government has antagonised them beyond belief.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working class have no jobs and they have no jobs for their kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harking back to the gentleman I met when I was riding on his backhoe going down the main street during the demonstration, he said, `You know, it's really heartbreaking because our daughter was hoping to get a job at Port Hinchinbrook and she's had to leave town. She's gone down to Brisbane. We've lost our daughter and our son left last week. So we've lost our son as well.' There were tears in his eyes when he said that. His family has broken up thanks to Senator Faulkner, who has left a dirty great, grubby mud hole in the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are not my words. They are the words of the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss&mdash;`Faulkner's mud hole'. A kilometre of coastline was cleared eight years ago and it will stay cleared for another eight years. It has absolutely no vegetation on it whatsoever. It is eroding out into the ocean and doing untold environmental damage, yet Senator Faulkner has decided to keep that situation as is because he has been listening to absolute imbeciles who clearly have no love for their country. Anyone who had any love for their country would demand that that area be rejuvenated. There is no way in the world the Goss government is going to rejuvenate that area, and the federal government is not either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what I am saying. The proposal by the green movement is to take this away. I am trying to illustrate the absolute outrageousness of the proposal in the first place. People from Tasmania may not have a view such as mine, but the fact that something like 95 per cent of the Australian population lives within 30 or 40 miles of water would indicate that people love to live near water. To take water away from an area to make it more beautiful is something that I simply do not understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come to the aesthetics, 95 per cent of the Australian people prefer to have water than not to have water there. Most certainly the Tasmanian population says, `If we can get cheap, clean, power from hydro-electricity schemes, then let's do it.' I am not saying that we should do it in some of the mainland areas, because we need that water badly for irrigation. If there is a choice, the water should go there rather than be used for energy creation, but in Tasmania it gives aluminium as simply congealed electricity. If we have cheap electricity, we have an advantage over the rest of the world. The reason why so much of it is done in Canada and New Zealand is to give those countries cheap hydro-electric power. If we do not have cheap hydro-electric power, if we drain Lake Pedder, we will have no cheap power and this little state&mdash;which is doing it so hard and so courageously&mdash;would not be given the opportunity to expand the aluminium industry which is being contemplated at the present moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The destructive force and the destructive nature of the environmental movement to the people of Tasmania is clearly illustrated. The green movement has caused thousands of jobs to be taken away from the forestry industry and now it is contemplating what will effectively close down the aluminium smelters, that is, the removal of the existing hydro-electric operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak briefly on the report handed down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment Recreation and the Arts <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder</EMPHASIS>. I was not a member of that committee but as a Tasmanian I thought it was incumbent upon me to give evidence. Having given evidence to the committee and having Lake Pedder in my electorate, I naturally have a great personal interest. I know I should adequately reflect the views of my constituents on this somewhat controversial issue for Tasmania and for the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of draining and restoring Lake Pedder to its original state, like the forestry issue, has polarised views in Tasmania but, unlike forestry, we have seen a clearer and more easily definable polarisation. In my view and in the view of most Tasmanians, this inquiry should never have proceeded in the first place. If the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, had asked the five members of the House of Representatives and the 12 senators who represent Tasmania, I think he would have had almost unanimous support, apart from Senator Devereux and perhaps Senator Coates, for this inquiry not proceeding in the first place. But ministers being ministers they do not usually consult people in the states that they intend to have some impact on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the committee were those that have been espoused by most people, apart from the dark greens. The dark greens have their own agenda to ensure that they can achieve maximum media coverage for their own electoral gain. It is interesting to note the results of a survey carried out by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> 7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Tasmania on 26 June, a couple of nights ago. One thousand people across Tasmania were surveyed about whether they thought Lake Pedder should be drained. The overall result for Tasmania was 89 per cent voting no and 6.5 per cent voting yes. Of those surveyed, 95 per cent of Liberals and 90 per cent of Labor voted no. Of the green component only 22 per cent of greens among the 1,000 people said it should be drained. Surprisingly, 66 per cent of those who had green allegiance said to leave it as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the minister bowed to pressure and agreed to this inquiry is, as I say, regrettable. Apart from educating members of the committee and closing this issue, hopefully once and forever, in my mind and in the minds of a vast majority of Tasmanians it has been an absolute waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry it has been interesting to note the claims and counterclaims made by the proponents and opponents of this proposal. Perhaps those on the committee and the public at large across Australia can now better understand the difficulties faced by those of us who represent our constituencies in these controversial parts of Australia when we are faced, inevitably in this day and age, with these environmental issues. You can never win, whatever you say, and you are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. It is a case of agreeing with the umpire if the decision goes your way but disagreeing vehemently if the umpire's decision is not what you see as the right and proper decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christine Milne, the Tasmanian leader of the Greens, said that the federal committee report was a safe, popular and politic decision but one that was cowardly and contradicted its own findings. When I made my own submission to the inquiry, I said that I was opposed to the damming of the original Lake Pedder. I marched with the many thousands against it. We were, as were many others on their trips to the west coast of Tasmania in those rather turbulent days in the 1970s, forced to remove the `No dam' stickers from our cars, to save them from being vandalised in the towns on the west coast which were very pro dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can bond with the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), when he delivered the report and made a statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I share the disappointment of those who loved and lost the original lake and believe that the decision to flood it was an appalling mistake.</PARA>
<PARA>I also mentioned in my submission that, if a proposal to dam the original lake were mooted today, there would be no way that it would proceed. However, we live not in the 1970s but in 1995, and we have the present Lake Pedder to consider, a huge lake covering 242 square kilometres. I call it a lake and not a dam&mdash;unlike the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who wrongly asserts that we should call it Dam Pedder. I would ask the member for Dunkley to look at some of the names given to other such structures around the world, and see how many of those are called dams rather than lakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 20 years, the large Lake Pedder has developed its own ecosystem, the flora and fauna adapting to the new lake's surrounds. It is a beautiful lake, nestling in a World Heritage area. Granted, it is not as scenic as the original one, but it still possesses its own unique beauty. It is visited by tourists and used by recreational fishermen, and is a source of wonderment in that part of my electorate. The lake is also an integral and significant part of the Tasmanian hydro-electric network. If the lake were ever drained, it would have an adverse effect on the capacity of power generation for all Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worthy of note is that part of the report in section 3.72 under the heading of `What questions need to be answered before commencing any restoration?' It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence about environmental aspects of the restoration proposal was characterised by enormous diversity of opinion and not a great deal of established fact. At best, discussion about the prospects for a successful restoration was based on predictions which in turn were based on extrapolations from similar studies and the wisdom of experience.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed draining was going to be no real comfort to the aquaculture industry in my part of the world, a thriving industry providing a huge number of jobs and a vast amount of export dollars for this country. The apple industry, which also would have been impacted upon if the proposal had gone ahead, is also based in my area, and that industry in the Franklin area contributes to 80 per cent of Australia's export apple industry, and is expanding at an enormous rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my submission to the committee, I stated that there are far more pressing environmental problems facing Tasmania, and Lake Pedder is way down on the list of priorities. I agree wholeheartedly with section 5.8 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the other potentially expensive environmental problems that require urgent attention are the deterioration of inland water resources, ecologically unsustainable land clearing, protection of endangered species, eradication of feral animals, restructuring of forest industries and urban air pollution . . . The Lake Pedder restoration proposal is therefore an optional project compared to the other pressing environmental concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my brief remarks by reading into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the editorial from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of 28 June.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, this Lake Pedder inquiry has been a very interesting one for the members of the committee. I do not think I have ever participated in an inquiry which has had before it such diametrically opposed evidence. I do not know how we could have had one witness after another come forward with evidence which contained such enormous contrasts. Indeed, it was hard, on many occasions, to come to any other conclusion than that some of the witnesses had allowed their emotional attachments to the issue to cloud their judgment. Frankly, it is just not possible, in many instances, to find a common harmonious thread through the evidence that was received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is room for differing opinions on many issues. Even in costing the worth of electricity, there are various methodologies that can be used. The committee received evidence that the value of the power that would be lost if Lake Pedder were to be drained was as different as $0 and $27.8 million per annum. The future value of electricity from Lake Pedder was put at between $0 and $450 million per annum. Those are enormous disparities. The real figure may be somewhere in between, but it is not possible to accept that all that evidence is accurate. Should Lake Pedder be drained, the cost of rehabilitation was put at both $0 and in excess of $2 billion dollars. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, between $0 and $2 billion were the figures placed before the committee in evidence. When a committee is confronted with those sorts of contrasts, it is difficult to come to a conclusion as to what the reality is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lake Pedder is in an attractive area of the globe. The old Lake Pedder was a very beautiful area. Some people regarded it as one of the wonders of the world. It is also beyond dispute that the enlarged lake is an attractive area. If you want to dispute which is the more beautiful, that is largely in the eye of the beholder. Certainly, it is the surrounds of the lake which make it a wilderness. The enlarged lake enhances the area of water, but it has covered areas which were considered by many to have great wilderness value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to admit that, as somebody who had not been to Lake Pedder before this inquiry, the image that I had of Lake Pedder was very different from the reality. I had seen the beautiful posters. I had an idea that Lake Pedder was surrounded by dense jungle&mdash;temperate rainforests and the like. It came as a surprise to me when I went there to find that the area largely comprised button grass plains. The large trees that I had envisaged were nowhere to be seen. There were only a few tangled bushes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the media have succeeded in portraying an image of Lake Pedder that is a long way from the reality. Fraser Island in my electorate is similarly portrayed. The public image of Fraser Island is of a sand area with gigantic trees and magnificent lakes. However, only two per cent of Fraser Island is covered in rainforest. The vast majority of it has vegetation of much lesser quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a public image of Lake Pedder which is a long way from the reality. The posters that are widely distributed these days by the Pedder 2000 supporters display a very beautiful picture, but it is a scene that would have been seen by very few Australians. However, even if the original Lake Pedder were there today, very few visitors to the area would ever see it the way the pictures portray it. To begin with, it rains for something like 300 days of the year, and it would be a rare occasion for visitors to see it with blue skies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day of the committee's visit, we were particularly fortunate and we did strike one of those rare fine days. It was a delight to be there. In addition, the exposed beaches were not seen by lots of visitors because, for a very large proportion of the year, the water level is high enough to cover the beaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were only a few days of the year when aircraft were able to land on the beach, and so visitors to Tasmania&mdash;even those who had travelled around the world to have that wonderful experience of flying into Lake Pedder&mdash;had a 90 per cent chance of not experiencing it. Generally speaking, it was only those who were brave enough to hike in by foot for many miles, through very rugged terrain and in unpleasant weather conditions, who saw it. So it was not the idyllic lake that is often portrayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the opportunity to see Lake Pedder has really only come about for most Australians and visitors from around the world because of the hydro-electricity schemes in the region. These schemes led to the construction of good all-weather roads that have enabled people to visit Lake Pedder in much larger numbers than in the past. So there has been a degree of imbalance in the way in which Lake Pedder has been portrayed to the people of the world. It was a beautiful area. It is still a beautiful area. It has tourism potential, and that tourism potential is likely to be enhanced as the years go by. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us get onto that key question, whether this lake is a critical element in the Tasmanian hydro-electric generation system. It needs to be emphasised that Lake Pedder is responsible for about 65 megawatts of electricity generation&mdash;and that general figure is agreed by the committee&mdash;of Tasmania's capacity of 1,173 megawatts. It is possible to argue that, at the present time, there is an oversupply in the Tasmanian system of about 60 megawatts so the system would not necessarily fail if Lake Pedder was not there. However, it needs to be remembered that, because the Tasmanian system is so totally dependent on hydro-electricity, Lake Pedder is very much a part of an integrated system. A water storage could not be removed from the system without it potentially having significant impact, particularly in times of dry weather. Lake Pedder is a very important part of the Gordon system, which is a very important part of the whole Tasmanian system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look at that overcapacity of 60 megawatts, because I think we need to put that into some degree of perspective. It is a very small overcapacity. There is a power station just outside the boundary of my electorate which produces more power than the entire Tasmanian system, and there are several others in the state of Queensland that have a similar capacity. Each unit at the Tarong power station produces 350 megawatts and Tasmania's entire spare capacity is only 60 megawatts. There is not the slightest doubt that Tasmania will grow into that capacity. Even though it may not be needed today, it certainly will be within a decade or so, and that is irrespective of whether any major new industry comes to Tasmania. Just the growth in general domestic use, and the normal industrial type growth that will occur in Tasmania, will see that 60 megawatts needed at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element in Tasmania's future electricity needs is the Bell Bay plant operated by Comalco. That plant is critical to Tasmania's economy. It is responsible for about 1,600 jobs, 780 being directly employed at the Bell Bay aluminium refinery. Comalco is faced with a very difficult decision at Bell Bay in that it cannot continue the operation in its current form. If it is going to be internationally competitive, it will have to expand the facility. If the facility does not become internationally competitive, it will have to be closed. If Lake Pedder was drained, there is not the slightest doubt that Comalco would not go ahead with the expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee put the question to Comalco executives in black and white. The answer to the question was that, if Lake Pedder was drained, without any doubt, Comalco would close. In fairness, it has to be said that, even if Lake Pedder is not drained, Comalco could still close. But if a decision was made at any level to drain Lake Pedder, and reduce Tasmania's capacity to supply hydro-electricity, there is no doubt that Bell Bay would close. I think that fact alone was enough for the committee to come down and say that there should be no further advancement of any proposals to drain the lake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the critical arguments put forward by Pedder 2000 was that jobs lost through the closure of Bell Bay would be made up for by extra tourism. In fact, Pedder 2000 spoke about 600 new jobs being created in the tourism area. Frankly that figure is just beyond belief. It would mean that there would have to be enormous growth in tourism to Tasmania. I do not believe that a remote lake would generate that number of extra tourists to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be borne in mind is that the Pedder 2000 proposal also involves excluding tourists from any area too close to the lake. A lookout point 15 kilometres away from the lake is being offered. Now I just do not think that hundreds of thousands of tourists are going to come from around the world to look at Lake Pedder from 15 kilometres away. In that sort of context, these claims are barely credible. Indeed, the real basis of the proposal is that this area should be returned to wilderness, that it should have its wilderness values restored. An essential element of that is to exclude visitors&mdash;to have as few people there as possible. I think a case could be mounted that tourism numbers would actually decline, rather than grow, if Lake Pedder was to be drained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a problem with this whole idea of devoting large parts of our continent to wilderness areas. It really is the ultimate in environmental snobbery to suggest that vast areas should be preserved for all time and people should be excluded from them. I am all for the development of national parks, and even wilderness areas. But their essential value to mankind is greatly enhanced if people are allowed to still enjoy them. If we start having large areas that people are not allowed to enter, we have to really seriously look at the environmental values that we are setting for our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important element that has been raised by other speakers is that even most environmentalists regard the draining of Lake Pedder as a low priority&mdash;even if it was technically feasible and even if it was a good idea environmentally. It is beyond doubt in my mind that there would be some cost. I am not prepared to put a figure on where, between the nought and two billion, that cost would be. But I am sure there would have to be some degree of human intervention to restore several hundred square kilometres to an acceptable environmental standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely when you look around at the problems confronting our own nation, Tasmania in particular, or the globe, this will never be a high environmental priority. Surely land degradation is a more significant issue&mdash;and the greenhouse effect, and the implications of world population. When I look at problems like the spreading deserts of Africa, the land degradation in our own continent, projects like the Three Gorges Dam in China, which is proceeding without much environmental objection, they all have to have a much higher priority than venturing, in a risky proposal, to drain Lake Pedder. Frankly, I do not believe that will ever change. I believe there will always be higher priorities than draining Lake Pedder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the idea of draining Lake Pedder is one which has gained acceptance way beyond its merit. Dr Brown in particular has pursued this through the media. He has got a lot of assistance from the ABC, some of whose leading on-air personalities are actively associated with the Pedder 2000 campaign. I think much of the media coverage on this issue has lacked balance, particularly on the mainland. Dr Brown's comments on this report have also been quite extraordinary. To suggest that the committee gave his proposals any comfort at all is really beyond any kind of proper fair reading of the report. I believe that his suggestion that we have given him any sympathy is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the project is technically feasible, as are many of this type, it lacks environmental priority, it lacks public support, it is potentially expensive, it may or may not work, and there are enormous environmental and social consequences as a result. I do not believe there is ever likely to be any new evidence which will alter this assessment and this report should be seen as an authoritative document for all time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder</EMPHASIS>, I think the debate that we have seen in this Main Committee has been quite useful. I have come to the realisation that, having been a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts since 1987, I happen to be the longest continuously serving member of the committee. I have to say that in this, the 37th, parliament, the committee has confronted two inquiries that have been the most challenging it has had to confront, save the conclusion of the irradiation inquiry that was ongoing when I joined the committee. But the two inquiries that we have had before us during this parliament have been the most challenging that I have seen the committee deal with. The first, of course, was the community recreation sport facilities inquiry earlier in this parliament, and the second was this inquiry on Lake Pedder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of comments have been made in the media and, indeed, a number of comments have been made throughout the discussion of this report in this debate, indicating that people felt that the inquiry itself was a waste of time. I do not believe that an inquiry such as this can be seen as a waste of time. I regret that the Premier of the state of Tasmania has so strongly come out with that view. This is an inquiry that the committee first got back on 8 December. In just over six months, we have completed an inquiry. There were many questions that we might have gone and looked at in greater detail. There are many ways that we might have sought more resources to have a more detailed inquiry. But on balance, through the consensus view of the whole committee, including the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) who has a dissenting report, it was felt that it was in the best interests of the issue to conclude the inquiry as expeditiously as possible without undermining the integrity of the findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the 11th person to speak in this debate. Nine of the 14 committee members will have had the opportunity, at the conclusion of my speech, to put on the public record their views. Any fair listener, or reader of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, would know that contained within those nine contributions is a wide, diverse range of views. The fact that, besides the honourable member for Dunkley, the committee was able to come to an overwhelming majority view and present it in this report, indicates that there is a great strength not only in this committee but also in the committee system of the House of Representatives. Of course, there are issues that will always be controversial, that are best concluded and decided by split decisions. But this issue was so fundamentally important that it was necessary that people with views on both sides of the argument should attempt to come to the consensus view that is represented by the conclusions of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking personally, I first had to be convinced that there was enough merit in the proposal to warrant the inquiry. After discussions, and after listening and viewing presentations by Pedder 2000, I came to the conclusion that this was something that warranted an investigation. But having listened to the evidence, having listened to the submissions that have been made to the members of the committee, I see that&mdash;for reasons I will try to outline&mdash;the conclusion reached by the committee is the valid conclusion for this moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through some of the issues and some of the arguments, The first is: is it possible? As a scientist, it was that question that attracted me to this proposal. It is something that the honourable member for Dunkley, in his dissenting report, goes to. The thought that we might be able to turn back and rectify what may have been a wrong decision back in the 1970s should capture people's excitement and should capture people's imagination. The committee clearly concluded that, in a geomorphological sense, the actual original lake could be returned. The bone of contention was the large area that is under water&mdash;basically, submerged button grass plains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a lot of discussion about that. We had discussion about how much mud might be covering those plains. I am a member of the committee who believes that the rehabilitation and restoration&mdash;we had discussions about the different meanings of those words&mdash;of those plains is possible. I agree that it would be a scientific challenge to achieve proper rehabilitation but it is possible. In having come to that conclusion, I have to underline that that possibility would require a great deal of resources. Of course, if it was left, over a long time nature would in its own way rehabilitate. But if we were to leave it at that, we would not be doing the right thing by the proper institution of this proposal. I am not going to try to put a figure on the amount of resources that would be required&mdash;I know that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has, as an economist, been amused by the figures that have been bandied around in the debate about a whole host of issues&mdash;but it would be a large cost. Therefore, in looking at this proposal and where it might rate compared with the priorities of other important environmental projects that we need to contend with, it has to rank at the moment as a lower priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, in an airport lounge recently I bumped into a prominent Australian who asked me what I was doing. When I informed him that I was involved in this inquiry, he said, `But surely we would be better off using the money to plant trees.' Even if we just look at it in simple terms in that way, it is easy to see how a number of the committee members came to a similar conclusion as I did: whilst the project may be worthwhile, at the moment there are definitely other priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other fact that we have to face is that this proposal would need the majority support of the community. I say to the Tasmanian members who have entered this debate, some of whom have felt that the inquiry was a waste of time, that one reason it was not a waste of time was that many members of the committee, like me, only realised through this inquiry the type of controversy and the environmental politics in Tasmania that the discussion of this proposal led to. It was not the inquiry that created this controversy; it was the proposal. I hope that the report in some way defuses that controversy and can mean that people that are looking at this fairly will see that there are other proposals that they might put their energy to that need to be immediately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some discussion about whether our report closes off the thought of restoring the original Lake Pedder forever. We can have the semantic argument about whether it does or does not. I am not sure whether it will be my children's generation&mdash;it may be their children's generation&mdash;but at some stage this proposal will be revisited. It will be revisited because people will continue to read the dissenting report of the honourable member for Dunkley and their imagination will be sparked by the sentiments of that report. But it will only happen when a whole host of conditions change. These are conditions that will not be challenges just for the Tasmanian people but will be challenges for the whole of Australia and for the whole of the international community. They will be about how we best use energy, how we best provide employment efficiently against energy uses, and how we best generate energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting parts of this debate that probably did not get the weight that it could have&mdash;it perhaps got ignored because we got tied up in the costings of the energy&mdash;is the simple truth that there is, on balance, great environmental benefit in using the hydro method of generation of electricity. But that has to be taken in contrast with and comparison to the type of environmental benefit that might be achieved by doing other things with the areas that have been impounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some of the critics have said that this was the safe and politic conclusion to come to. But, as I have said, without full agreement&mdash;not only at a national level but, especially, in the Tasmanian political arena&mdash;it would be futile to put this proposal further up the priority list at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciated the comments of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). He, as a member who was added to the committee, has given recognition to the way in which the committee conducted the inquiry and the fact that&mdash;whilst there was the range of views that this debate has illustrated and I have emphasised&mdash;we were able to get on with the job and we were able to come up with a report that makes a worthwhile contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the chair, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), has also been acknowledged. People know of his great commitment to matters environmental. He also brought with him a large degree of economic expertise, and the economic aspects, as has been illustrated by other contributors to the debate, are very important and controversial. So the fact that he chaired the inquiry that came to the conclusion that this has was very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could get into a whole host of debates. I listened with interest to the discussion of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) concerning the effect on tourist numbers if we were to drain or not drain. They were things that there was a certain degree of disagreement about around the table. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if Pedder 2000 had a management plan for the drained lake, it was not necessarily the management plan that we would have envisaged. There would have been&mdash;and the report goes to this&mdash;a need for a lot of work to be done on an environmental assessment and a management plan that went to not only the way that the lake could physically be drained, but also the rehabilitation efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been discussion of what we would have done with the large population of platypuses that are in the impoundment. I think that, as with the button grass&mdash;there would have had to have been efforts for the rehabilitation of the flora&mdash;the fauna would have had to have rehabilitation. Those animals that have flourished in the new, larger lake would have had to have been dealt with, and the rehabilitation of the appropriate fauna that we had in the original lake would have had to have been assisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this has been a worthwhile inquiry. It is in the best traditions of the committee system of the House of Representatives, and I am sorry that there have been those critics who have just dismissed it as being a waste of time and not a major contribution to what is an important environmental question. </PARA>

This inquiry, instigated by the then Attorney-General, the member for Holt (Mr Duffy), was wide ranging and lengthy. At times I felt that there was a certain reluctance on the part of the committee to come to grips with the amount of detail that was required for the detailed examination of the processes of retaining confidentiality within government departments and government agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We began this inquiry on the basis that it is a statutory requirement that Australian citizens provide confidential personal information about their finances, their property or their health to government agencies, in order to gain benefits from those agencies. It is a process of trust. All members of this House would have, on occasions, struck individuals who are most reluctant to provide any personal information. Whilst those individuals want the benefits, they also have a great distrust of the bureaucratic processes of government, of personnel within government, and of the ultimate designs that governments may have on the records that they are required to give in order to gain health, social security or employment benefits, or even to be able to register for some form of entitlement in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, over a period of months, Senator Richardson had to yield to the views of the Senate. The post of Privacy Commissioner was established and there were battles between Senator Richardson and the Privacy Commissioner as to the degree of confidentiality that should be applied to records held by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have looked at all of those things and we have come forward with a fairly good report. In my view as deputy chairman of the committee, it lacks detail and bite in a couple of areas but as a first attempt it is a good one. I suggest that it needs a follow-up in a year or two to see whether agencies have taken note of these recommendations, whether they realise that the parliament is serious about the protection of confidential information and whether they have adopted procedures where there are blatant discrepancies and blatant failures to safeguard confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in passing in regard to this matter, I refer the Committee to an article on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, indicating that Australian tax officials are browsing individual files. To me it is a matter of deepest concern that an individual, without supervision or approval from a superior officer, can go and browse the taxation returns of any constituents. That article, entitled `Flash! And the tax office lights up', by Mike Taylor, is a report of a hearing concerning the ATO, where an officer had extended his browsing rights to gathering information from a private employer for whom he worked for a short period of time. He then returned to the tax office and used the information that he had gained while in private employment to organise audits and raids on his former employer in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was pretty severely dealt with by the tax office, but in the process of the hearing it was disclosed that it is considered by the tax office that it is not inappropriate that audit officers browse files and try to pick up information about the behaviour of certain individuals that might lead them on a trail to make fines following an audit. This is a wrong process and I think it discloses an ethos and a practice that the committee felt was there but was never disclosed by the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this process is driven by an incentive payment to the officer if he instigates a successful audit. It is money in his pocket if he screws somebody for every bit of tax that he can get out of him. So we have here a grossly improper process. A person using the authority of the Crown for personal gain on a particular issue can go to any individual and draw up a list of misdemeanours, relying on confidential information. The power of the Crown can be held over that individual in the hope of gaining some sort of conviction or, from my knowledge of the community, a willingness to admit that there may have been a breach and then a willingness to settle quickly to stop any further disruption to a business or to a place of work. That is grossly improper and it was never disclosed by the tax office. In the strongest terms I condemn the tax office for neither making disclosures nor saying that it encouraged a turn-back process to allow audit officers to browse files. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from the newspaper a statement which I understand was made by a Merit Protection and Review Agency disciplinary appeal committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"These officers are empowered to access and search the ATO records of any people who to them looked likely to be avoiding paying tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"These activities were subject to limited supervision in that while approval ought to be sought before accessing records, according to the evidence it seems that this was not always the case."</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a financial incentive offered to tax officers. They go and browse the files, sometimes without approval, as admitted by the tax office, completely in breach of all the confidentiality rules and regulations laid down the Commonwealth and deserving the highest condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matches other information that came to us from an ICAC inquiry in New South Wales into the affairs of state government officials. It indicated that there are officials selling confidential information to private organisations&mdash;banks, credit agencies and all sorts of groups. Mr Justice Roden, in that inquiry, said that he believed&mdash;and it is on our record&mdash;that the Commonwealth officials are just as much in breach as he found state officials to be. He believed that an ICAC type inquiry into Commonwealth administration would disclose, in areas such as Telecom, social security and health, a commercial value for information held in trust by the Commonwealth. I pursued that line of argument with him and he was strongly of the opinion that the Commonwealth needed to clean up its act. I refer the Committee to appendix E, which is a study of a number of cases of Commonwealth breaches identified by Mr Justice Roden even though it was not his purpose to investigate those breaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, Telecom made three submissions and appeared twice because the committee was very unhappy with its attitude. The Telecom representatives said that it was now a commercial organisation and did not have to worry about confidentiality to any great degree. Finally, they admitted that they had put in place a very strong, cogent and cohesive process for confidentiality for all of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within weeks it was revealed that Telecom was bugging its clients to find out what their views about Telecom were. So here is a group&mdash;a Commonwealth group&mdash;grossly misleading a Commonwealth parliamentary committee. While that organisation was giving evidence somebody in the same organisation was listening into private conversations, unauthorised. Tony Packard, one of my state members, was chucked out of the New South Wales parliament for listening to private conversations on his own premises, yet we had somebody meant to be providing a service listening in an unauthorised way to conversations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is need for stringent application of a code of confidence and privacy throughout the Australian Public Service. We have come up with numerous recommendations, including: the head of each department having full responsibility for confidentiality practice; strong guidelines for all Commonwealth agencies on monitoring and reporting to parliament on the privacy processes within each department; disclosures having to be notified, noted and reported, including the date, the type of search and the person to whom the information was disclosed; confidential third party information on computers is critical and the browsing of computers should have very strict procedures placed on it; and the Australian National Audit Office ought to conduct efficiency audits of all of these major user agencies on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office has found gross discrepancies in practice in a number of departments, has provided this parliament with at least two reports and is in the process of doing a third report. It can demonstrate time and time again a cavalier attitude on the part of a number of agencies or elements within agencies. The Telecom example I quoted earlier typifies a cavalier attitude and must be condemned and changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In data matching, where information is gained from the Australian Tax Office in the tax file number process, there is a privacy process in place, and I must say that all government departments tend to observe the processes very well. But where there is not a tax file number the process is outside the scope of the Privacy Act, and we had evidence of as many as 100 million data matches out in the community which are known only to departments, unknown by the individuals involved, and they are completely unauthorised and unsupervised. We do not know whether they are destroyed at the end of the period of the data match, no records are kept and there is no process of accountability. This matter must be brought within the ambit of the Privacy Act as we believe that semi-government agencies must also be gathered within a confidentiality code that protects the privacy of Australian individuals. Indeed, the committee goes so far as to recommend that there should be a privacy code of confidentiality across the nation that the private and public sector need to adhere to.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been an important inquiry and I trust it is one that will be revisited by future parliaments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I became a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs after the reference on the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth had been given to the committee. As indicated by the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell, the reference was received from the former Attorney-General, the member for Holt (Mr Duffy), who is now one of the members of the committee. The reference is particularly interesting to me. Anyone who has ever gone into a renovator's dream property and scratched away at the wall and exposed more unforeseen repairs will understand the nature of the problem that we are facing here. This issue is an incredibly complex one with which to grapple, particularly for those of us who are barely literate in terms of information technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the good old days, we had bits of paper on file, people put their signatures on the bits of paper and the files were stuffed in drawers. In the good old days it was easy to control&mdash;perhaps. However, the complexity of information technology today and the way in which it hangs together in government departments, across the nation and at an international level means that it is very hard to understand, let alone to keep up with the pace of change. This is particularly so for people who are my age, but I will not speak for my children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the tip of the iceberg, and, although the committee recognises this fact, the committee was very keen to ensure that it produced a report which gave some direction. With this issue, as with many others around information technology and information policy in Australia, we are in the situation of beginning to understand what we have yet to deal with. As a result of other aspects which were identified in the course of preparing this report, I expect that this committee will be given more references of a similar nature in the relatively near future. In addition, other committees, other departments and the community will need to deal with the issues around information policy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of points of view and points of concern from which to look at this issue, and there are, perhaps, points of opportunity. Australia is the second most involved country in information technology next to the United States. Our per capita use of information technology, particularly computer technology, is second only to the United States. This situation gives us a number of things to consider, such as how to use the situation to our best advantage by playing with these things and by putting them all together. The situation also provides us with opportunities to make use of our natural advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should take account of the fact that there is progress in Australia which we need to be aware of. Some of the progress relates to privacy and the protection of information. We have an opportunity which is, in many ways, ahead of most other countries, and it is, therefore, important to get it right for government, to get it right for business and to get it right for the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD has recognised this requirement in a number of ways. Justice Michael Kirby chaired the OECD committee which looked at developing security guidelines for the protection of information. If Australia wants to be the leading light in the Asia-Pacific region in this area, our progress gives us that opportunity. Given that Australia can develop the legal, technological and cultural framework to deal with the power of information technology and the ability to protect information, we have a magnificent opportunity to place ourselves at a particular point in the world in the international trade area that will be of benefit to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that if a big company is spread around the world, and its information is circling the globe at increasing volume and increasing speed, it wants to know that its information is safe from predators of whatever kind. If we have the legal, technological and cultural framework here in Australia, we do not become the weakest link, and the weakest link of information is the biggest risk to any company because information really is dollars. That is part of the problem we have seen throughout this process. We might not like to think it is nice, but what often happens out there is that there is trade in information. That happens in the private sector, in the commercial world and, unfortunately, I believe it also happens in the world of government&mdash;state and federal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is money paid for information of names and lists. A lot of charities and a lot of businesses operate on the basis of buying names that they think might be applicable in getting support for their particular needs. Whether it be the problem described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning, as the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) pointed out, of people doing it for their own particular advantage or the problem of someone who is going to trade that on for advantage to somebody else, these issues really have to be confronted&mdash;and confronted very seriously. And, again, the issue of government is just a tip of the iceberg. The committee has done a pretty good job, considering the limitations it was under, to deal certainly with the beginnings of these issues. As I said, I expect there will be many more to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One emphasis that seemed to come through most of the submissions was that it was a cultural matter. It is not just cultural. It has to be more than the sort of passive reaction that says, `Oh, yes, we will talk about it and try to make people more aware of it.' It has to be a far more aware response than that. As we have recommended in this report, it needs a very direct, active response by senior managers to accept responsibility. It should not be just something done around a cup of tea, like a workshop or a seminar, but active responsibility for protection of information. That responsibility must also be sheeted home at a very high level. In fact, the secretary to the department must be the person ultimately very much on the front line in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think culture is important. The legal framework and people's responsibilities, particularly in relation to the Privacy Act, are important. But it is also important from the point of view of technology. One of the things we face is that technology in this area is changing dramatically and it is therefore very important that the Privacy Act is kept in touch with the changes in technology. We have spoken about data matching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from my own experience that in some aspects of government there is great benefit to government and the taxpayer from some forms of data matching. They are quite useful in the way in which programs can be put together to save money, to identify problems, and so forth. Many of the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner quite legitimately relate to the problems around data matching and the problems that technology will allow an interference in the rights of privacy. The Privacy Act needs to be flexible or modified sufficiently quickly to keep up with the technology so that governments and individuals are enhanced by the Privacy Act all the way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the other issues that have been raised is browsing, which in many ways is a cultural problem. Some people might be a bit bored at lunch time and decide to go for a little wander through the files to see what interesting things are there. It all sounds very exciting. But culturally, and in terms of people's rights, it is a pretty nasty thing to do. On the other hand, there are issues of hacking and there are people who would do that for purposes of industrial or government espionage, fraud, theft, mischief, or, in many cases&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the committee has recommended, which is very important in terms of sanctions and the Crimes Act, is the way in which all aspects, all points of that interchange of information, become subject to sanction. In the past, that has not necessarily been the case. There is quite a degree of disparity in the way in which issues of information crime are dealt with between various acts of sanction. What we are suggesting is a far more concrete way, a far more deliberate and comprehensive way to deal with this matter. It is something which I am sure will go a long way to producing not only a better culture but also a better legal framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I believe that the terms of reference were quite limited and perhaps in some sense that indicates how unaware we were, even a matter of a couple of years ago, of things that had been changing around us. I would expect that there would be a number of other approaches through other committees about how these things are impacting upon our society, upon the way we conduct government and, indeed, business. The recommendation of a national privacy code, as the member for Mitchell has already indicated, is a very important concept to be grasped. We have found that, as many organisations are privatised or corporatised, one way or another they move outside the direct ambit of the Privacy Act, and then a lot of information also moves with them. Whether or not it concerns issues that we have discussed, such as Telecom or many others, there is a need for Australian citizens, for the good conduct of business and government, to ensure that that privacy code extends right across the national framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that in Australia, with the fact that we are intensely information rich&mdash;or have the potential to be information rich&mdash;we have an opportunity to position ourselves to set up legal, cultural and technological frameworks to ensure that we have an industry and an attitude which is in advance of those of any other country in the world. We have opportunities here to make ourselves a centre of information and information policy that we can draw on. Once we start drawing on policy and legal frameworks, we start to develop technological and industrial edges as well. This is where the future is; we are all part it. I believe that this report is, again, the beginning of perhaps a renovator's dream of information policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just thank my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) for allowing me to precede him, because I wanted to make a few remarks and I do have another commitment. I would echo very much the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) in the presentation of this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I wanted to speak was to highlight two particular problems I see. The first is that, while I endorse everything that is in the committee report, there is a real problem in the conflict between the public's right to know and the privacy of the individual. I do not know, even in these recommendations, whether we have actually given enough emphasis to that apparent conflict. The line drawn between the absolute necessity, for public purposes, for there to be availability of information and the right of individuals to protect their own information as something sacrosanct is a fine line; and I accept that. But it worries me. It is not that anyone would suggest that, under every public service log or under every area of information, there is necessarily information to which everybody has a right to gain access. I want to talk in a minute about a few abuses of that which worry me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly a real problem: if you prevent information being disclosed, then it is going to be very difficult for the public servant in many instances to undertake his responsibility. It is also difficult for the public at large, if they are denied access to some of that information, to understand the processes of government; and, for ministers and for government itself, it becomes extraordinarily hard to formulate public policy. We have made a number of recommendations which are all trended towards the development of the privacy code to which the honourable member for Mitchell referred, and towards the prevention of undue disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all an absolute necessity, but I am worried that there may be too much emphasis on the protection of the information as distinct from the real requirement to ensure that information is available for the purposes for which it is required. Of course, in stating the reasons that information is to be channelled between departments and the way in which there are to be controls, we have tried to ensure that there are not too many restraints; but it is a side of the privacy debate that needs to be identified. In the presentation of this report, it would be wrong if that were not given some emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, and having agreed with my colleagues, I feel that there are two other important things to mention. Essentially, the days of the Internet have changed the availability of information and the access to it, in a way that really does promote enormous challenges. One of the examples where that is apparent is in a number of instances in recent revolutions, where it has been possible for information to be exchanged over the Internet about what is happening long before anyone else knows. In closed societies, such as those of China and the former Soviet Union, it has been particularly important, because the information has come out through the Internet before it has come out in any other form of communication, and that ensures that, in closed societies, there is some chance of knowing what goes on. The Internet has enormous implications in all sorts of ways, quite apart from those on which Kerry Packer is currently trying to capitalise. It is important that it be used in a way which does not unduly discourage individuals by making them feel that, whatever they say or do, everything they own and all their personal affairs are suddenly going to be available at large. Of course, that is the reason for our recommendation of a privacy code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the availability of information that numbers of us have referred to over time has been the frequency with which, in recent times, individuals&mdash;particularly in Nigeria, but in Africa generally&mdash;have been writing to individuals to solicit funds or to suggest that there are huge sums of money available in some way for people to be given access to. A number of my own constituents have received such letters in the past fortnight. I have received one myself, in my private capacity. It appals me that out there, regrettably, there are likely to be people gullible enough to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to use the opportunity of this debate to say that, if anybody receives a letter of that sort&mdash;suggesting that there are many millions of available funds which, in some way, are going to be accessible to them and which they can pay into their bank account, perhaps gaining access to some commission for so doing&mdash;they should firstly take that letter to their nearest federal member. If they do not know who their federal member is, they should write to the federal Attorney-General, enclosing that letter. Under no circumstances should they try to make contact with the person whose name is on that letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several letters&mdash;there is not only one individual involved&mdash;and all of them are highly suspect. As I say, they are part of the invasion of privacy which the sale of confidential lists of names in fact represents. Unfortunately, the problem exists commercially as much as it does in the public sector, and these names may well have even come from the Stock Exchange, the Australian Securities Commission or electoral rolls. They could have come from anywhere. This is a very good example of behaviour which this particular report attempts to redress. I am concerned that the nature of the lure being offered is such that I have little doubt that people will be tempted to respond. I say to any of them that, if they have any doubts at all, and if they do not know the person writing the letter, they should not respond. They should take the letter to somebody else and get advice before they react to it in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of at least 20 instances in my own electorate in the last few weeks where such letters have been made available. They are all totally false. The funds to which the letters refer are non-existent, and the economies of the countries from which the letters emanate are in such a state that if they were true, it would be the people of those countries who would be prejudiced if any such transaction did result. Having said that, I commend the report; but I think there does need to be a balance between the public right to know and the essential privacy of the individual. In the report we have attempted to identify that balance. I believe it has been reasonably effectively secured, and for that reason I support the recommendations in the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join with other members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in supporting the 39 recommendations which the committee has handed down. This report on the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth is another indication of how effectively many of the committees of the House of Representatives are working. I had a previous term in this place from 1984 to 1987, and I have noticed a tremendous change in the ensuing years. There is a very real sense of cooperation in those committees. On many occasions we might not agree, but the result is that the reports which are handed down are thought provoking. As they are worked out, wherever possible we are able to come to common principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report we are discussing today has had a fairly long and tortuous history. It has been to two parliaments and it has been subjected to two Attorneys-General. Because of the recent trend to refer bills to the committee for consideration, perhaps it has not been possible to give this report the attention that this committee would otherwise have chosen to give to it. During the period over which this reference has been considered, four substantial reports on bills have been prepared in 10 months. I believe that both the government and the opposition have been very pleased with the way that the committee has been able to consider bills and bring forward recommendations, many of which have been considered and have been adopted by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the upside. The downside is that the report we are discussing today has been delayed. It was initially brought before the committee by the former Attorney-General, now a member of the committee, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). Terms of reference were advertised, and numbers of meetings and public hearings took place. Following the election in 1993 and the appointment of the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to that position, the terms of reference which have resulted in this report were seen as being of continuing significance, to the extent that the Attorney again referred the terms of reference to the committee on 28 May 1993. Further submissions were called for, and 109 submissions and 40 exhibits were received from a wide range of groups in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the important aspects of the work of the committee system. We are able to advertise in newspapers, and people who have an interest in what the law should be or how the law should be changed are able to make a contribution. In this case we received contributions from civil liberties groups, consumer organisations, law societies, academics, financial institutions and, most importantly, Commonwealth departments and agencies. It is fairly clear that anyone who had an interest in this particular area of confidential information has brought forward a submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have brought forward a unanimous report, but, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said a moment ago, as society in Australia becomes more complex we have a continuing conflict between the right of privacy of the individual and the right of the public to have access to information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significantly, in the course of its deliberations the committee considered the possibility of the amalgamation of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. There are views one way and the other. Initially I was sympathetic to bringing both of these acts under the same umbrella, but on reflection it was a decision of the committee that the two acts should continue to be separate acts. After all, they deal with different aspects of citizens' rights. The Freedom of Information Act concentrates on the right of the citizen to have access to information in the public arena, and the Privacy Act emphasises our individual rights to privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been indicated by prior speakers, what we need to do is to create a culture in the public services of Australia and in government agencies and, I believe, in the commercial organisations also, where the privacy of the individual is respected. It takes a while for such a culture to build up. It simply cannot be legislated for and it does not happen overnight. However, from the submissions we received and from the attitudes we were able to perceive from groups contacting us, I think that we are well along the way to an improvement in this culture of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As society develops and becomes more complex and as technology gallops along, there are additional complications. The honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), in his contribution, drew our attention to a number of those matters. Most importantly, the committee has directed its attention to the need for computer security. As we have more people working at home&mdash;I do not know whether they would be called outworkers&mdash;on private computers, a lot of the information which would normally be stored in a central area goes home with the person. Clearly, what we need to do is to make sure that that information is subjected to the same rules, regulations and protections as information generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it is very important to realise that, as the government and all governments accept, the federal bureaucracy does not always have the best and most efficient means of handling matters and, as a result of this, we have more contracting out. The law must therefore be applied to the agencies contracting with government in order to make them responsible for privacy principles in the same way as the government bureaucracy itself. It would be terrible if, in the pursuit of financial efficiency and efficiency in government generally, we referred matters out to private organisations and, when those referrals were made, the citizen was no longer protected in the same way as a citizen would have been had matters continued to be handled by the government. It is very important that the committee has covered this in its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that we really have to look at is that, although there has been a growing appreciation in government of the need to preserve a citizen's privacy, because it has not been a high priority the junior pen-pusher&mdash;the junior office boy, or office person, to be politically correct&mdash;quite often has been responsible for privacy. The result is that there have been some fairly appalling lapses of privacy. The committee heard very disturbing examples where, in some cases, Commonwealth public servants have even sold information. That is very worrying. One of the recommendations very much necessary to treat privacy with the importance that we want it treated is to ensure that senior managers in government agencies and government bodies are indeed responsible for privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the many and varied laws throughout Australia, one finds that different items of legislation provide for different levels of privacy in different circumstances. That is why I support very strongly the proposal of the committee that there be the development of a privacy code, so that we can have a consistency of standard. I certainly hope that the government takes this up when there are consultations between the Commonwealth government, on the one hand, and the various state and territory governments on the other. This really is very important. As the honourable member for Jagajaga pointed out, the government in this country needs to help create the legal, cultural and technological framework to make sure that we have the right approach to privacy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England also highlighted another matter which I was going to mention&mdash;the Internet. Almost on a daily basis, when we open the newspapers we find how this new technology is galloping along. I am told that there could be up to a billion people on the Internet by the year 2000 and currently in Australia we have 500,000 people who apparently are linked to the Internet. One really must look very seriously at the Internet to see how it is possible to protect the privacy of individuals because the technology is different. It could be that our report may have been overtaken by technology and that a future committee must look at this again. It is one of those very important items of activity which must be consistently reviewed on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Internet and people surfing the Internet is very much a new phenomenon. One can imagine, if there is a breach of privacy, that it would be possible for that information to be put on the Internet and, by the year 2000, that information would be available to a billion people throughout the world. That is certainly a mind-boggling and very concerning situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As prior speakers have indicated, this is a report which attracted the unanimous support of both coalition and government members. Some of us would have liked the report to have been a little more extensive in some areas, but it is vital for the government to recognise that this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a unanimous report. It represents the collective wisdom of both sides of parliament. We sat down over a period of three years and sought to bring forward recommendations to the government. We have had many submissions and two sets of public hearings. We sat during two parliaments and the result is, in the dying stages of this parliament, we are fortunate to be able to present this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the minister looks at it very seriously because the current situation is, in my view, that the privacy of individuals in our society is inadequately protected by the current law. No reasonable person in Australia today will deny that privacy is inadequately protected, but, as the right honourable member for New England has pointed out and as I alluded to earlier, it is absolutely vital to ensure that there is a balance between the right of privacy of an individual on the one hand and the right of the public to have access to important information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government will consider this report expeditiously. In the past some reports have taken far too long to be considered. In fact, the lead time to a response to some of these reports has been so long that the report has been entirely out of date and committees have had to go back to the drawing board yet again. Because the committee has had quite a substantial amount of additional work during the period of its deliberations, already we have had to visit this area on two occasions and we have had two committees. I understand only three members of the current committee were members of the previous committee and there has been a lot of duplication. It is important that the government takes on board what this committee has recommended, comes back promptly with a response and adopts as many of the recommendations contained in this report as is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge future Attorneys-General&mdash;we hope the next Attorney-General will be a member of the coalition&mdash;to continue to refer this subject matter on a regular basis to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is a vital area and we all have a vested interest in making sure that we have principles and laws of fairness and equity in this area on the statute books in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to support the report and I join colleagues on both sides in doing so. I urge the government to give a prompt response and I hope that the response is a positive adoption and acceptance of the recommendations which we, as a committee, have made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence</EMPHASIS> report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I wish to bring to the attention of the House serious neglect of questions relating to the protection of confidentiality of information held by the Commonwealth. I refer in particular to the ASIS fiasco, as the entire history of the ASIS fiasco runs contrary to the spirit of the recommendations in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly refer to the invasion of the privacy of ASIS officers and of the wife of one of the officers, and serious breaches of privacy and the principles of medical confidentiality. I will, in this context, examine the most publicised case, that of an officer whom I shall describe as `officer 2'. The illegal and unethical treatment of officer 2 was the catalyst to the ASIS fiasco, as we are all aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, friction developed between officer 2 and a Foreign Affairs colleague&mdash;Mr Douglas Woodhouse, a senior Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade administrative officer&mdash;while en poste in New Delhi. False and malicious&mdash;indeed, defamatory&mdash;rumours concerning the officer and his wife were spread by Mr Woodhouse. Upon his return to Canberra, Mr Woodhouse made an unsigned and highly defamatory statement to ASIS management, on the condition that it would never be shown to the ASIS officer. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KD4">Mr ALDRED</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member rightly expresses some concern. This extraordinary caveat denied natural justice and procedural fairness to the officer and his wife. Officer 2 and his wife were placed in a Kafkaesque situation in which they were not informed of the nature of the allegations against them, nor did they know the identities of the accusers. Thus they could not respond to the allegations. This action violated the safeguards rightly recommended in the report now before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, even this travesty of an inquiry, based on hearsay, triggered a second internal investigation in January 1991. The officer attempted to resolve these rumours by approaching the present director-general, Mr Rex Stevenson, without resolution. The second inquiry, which concluded on 28 May 1991, was again based on hearsay and unsigned statements, and was critical of the officer. Once again, all key witnesses refused to sign their combined records of conversation without serious qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, the officer found its verdict bizarre, and formally lodged a grievance through internal ASIS procedures. On 30 April 1991, the officer began a series of complaints to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Roger Holdich. Consistent with the record of that farcical organisation, nothing was resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant document in the ASIS fiasco is the secret report of the ASIS grievance panel of 12 July 1991. The ASIS grievance panel was headed by one of the most widely respected and outstanding officers in ASIS, a staff and welfare association representative and an independent member&mdash;a former senior diplomat. Its findings were unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grievance panel found, inter alia, that officer 2 had `a satisfactory work record and some of his operational work was assessed as above average'. It also found that `internal ASIS inquiries' had been `unreasonably protracted and biased against the officer'. The grievance panel found that the ASIS investigation had placed an `unreasonable strain on the officer's family' and `that the matter should have been settled much sooner'. Further, it stated that the portrayal of the officer by ASIS inquiries was `overstated and biased'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grievance panel also found that the officer's assessments for 1989 and 1990, relevant to the grievance panel's inquiries, were `missing', that `it would appear they have been hidden or destroyed', and that they were believed by the panel to be favourable to the officer. In plain English, ASIS internal investigators had deliberately destroyed the officer's relevant records, which would have supported his case. This is a most appalling indictment. The deliberate destruction of Commonwealth documents is a serious offence, and violates the principles and procedures espoused in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence</EMPHASIS> report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASIS panel recommended that the officer's operational record be corrected and that the officer was suitable for further work. Indeed, it pointed out that the Director-General of ASIS valued the work of the officer and wanted to keep the officer on staff. Most pointedly, the grievance panel found that, if the officer proceeded to leave ASIS, `His separation provisions should be handled in a cooperative and generous way.' Due to Senator Evans's negligence, they were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant unexamined matter in the ASIS fiasco which is of special relevance to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence</EMPHASIS> report is the malevolent role of Mr Douglas Woodhouse, the senior DFAT officer who was the source of the allegations against officer 2 and his wife, which allegations the Samuels report accurately described as `little more than unauthenticated gossip'. Mr Woodhouse consistently refused to sign these allegations, even when officially requested by ASIS. Mr Woodhouse also claimed that the officer's wife was `a security risk'&mdash;although she was not on the ASIS staff&mdash;and threatened her that `he would destroy her husband'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a most serious breach of the Privacy Act and confidentiality, Mr Woodhouse claimed to use as a `subsource' the doctor of the officer's wife who, according to Mr Woodhouse, reported that the wife of the officer was receiving psychiatric treatment and was suicidal. Significantly, a recent DFAT possible parliamentary question brief prepared in May 1995 for Senator Evans suggested that ASIS could legally receive from, and use, medical information from a doctor of an Australian citizen without revealing the source. The PPQ reveals DFAT's and the Attorney-General's Department's contempt for the Privacy Act and principles of medical confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conduct highlights a major deficiency in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence </EMPHASIS>report we are now debating in that it merely confines its concerns about medical confidentiality to cancer and epidemiology. However, the issues of the political use of medical information and invasion of privacy are much broader. Senator Evans should be condemned for the use of KGB psychological tactics. I refer to Senator Evans's use of a rumour based pseudo-psychological report prepared by ASIS and used uncritically by Mr Roger Holdich and Mr Rex Stevenson for the so-called confidential briefing of Senator Sue Knowles and other senior Liberal MPs. I emphasise that the use of the so-called psychological report was on Senator Evans's initiative. Senator Evans's actions were explicitly criticised in Justice Samuels's report as `highly inappropriate'. So much for DFAT and Senator Evans's respect for medical ethics and the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the ASIS fiasco, Senator Evans can never again be described as a champion of civil liberties or human rights. He would certainly be highly uncomfortable with the general approach of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence </EMPHASIS>report. No investigation of the ASIS fiasco would be complete without the most rigorous scrutiny of the role of Mr Woodhouse and the motives for his grossly improper and illegal conduct. I refer to Mr Woodhouse's allegations which were made on his imposed condition that they were not to be disclosed to the officer or his wife. It should be pointed out that Mr Woodhouse has had no formal training for investigations of any kind. Characteristically, DFAT, in its indomitable style, rewarded Mr Woodhouse by promoting him to be head of the fraud and discipline unit. He is now enjoying his unearned fruits of a valued position in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Senator Evans, at a Senate estimates committee on 31 August 1993, at a time when Woodhouse's role in the ASIS fiasco was well known to him, described him as `an outstanding officer from my experience'. Evidently, Senator Evans approves of Woodhouse's KGB management style based on character assassination. The question must be asked: why has Mr Woodhouse escaped punishment for his serious criminal offences against DFAT and ASIS officers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dust over the ASIS fiasco has not settled. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence </EMPHASIS>report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will, by bringing debate on privacy concerns to the fore, make it more difficult to cover up the ASIS fiasco. Threatening to imprison journalists and muzzle the press are no solutions to the security fiasco that Senator Evans has created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has nothing to gain by tapping the telephones of journalists, including that of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> journalist David Lague or the ASIS officers concerned in the recent controversy. This is a most lamentable invasion of the privacy of individuals in a democracy. The use of medical records, especially contrived or deliberately misinterpreted, as in the ASIS fiasco, and used as a form of character assassination, as in the ASIS case, should have no place in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to stop the telephone interceptions of our most noted journalists and related surveillance. We must defend press freedom, even though Senator Evans suddenly finds press freedom a personally repugnant concept. Nor should DSD ever again engage in, or distribute, the product of interception of international telephone calls made by Australian citizens, as it did in the ASIS fiasco, especially when these citizens were the major complainants to an inquiry to which the government was a party. It is widely recognised that there is an ineluctable tension between the principles of privacy and publicity in a democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this government is incapable of achieving the fine balance necessary to ease that tension. In failing to respond to the challenge in a mature manner, it is at odds with the philosophical approach taken in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence</EMPHASIS> report. I recommend careful study of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In confidence </EMPHASIS>report to the government. They are obviously in need of guidance from this report, which, hopefully, it will provide. I seek leave to table the possible parliamentary question which is referred to in this speech.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Olympics 2000 . . . and the winner is?</EMPHASIS> Could I indicate at the outset my appreciation of the work of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), both of whom carried the brunt of this inquiry, together with the secretarial staff. It is worth noting, when you compare to it some other committee reports, the relative promptness with which this report was written.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry obviously concerned the year 2000 Olympics and the contribution the games can make to Australia's image in the region. More particularly, the inquiry looked at the sports equipment industry, issues such as the marketing of Olympic merchandise, the question of the infrastructure that will develop around the Olympics and, in general, Australia's possible gains from this Olympic win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I at the outset also raise in a bigger sense the question of employment and its relationship with this inquiry. The main reason I am particularly interested in that aspect is the fact that a predominant part of the Olympics site is in my electorate. It is worth noting that the central west region of Sydney, in the last quarter figures, has an unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent, two percentage points above the national average. It is also worth keeping in mind that there was a very strong drop in the unemployment rate in the region in the last year, going down by 4 1/2 per cent, whereas the national trend only went down by 1.6 per cent. To some degree it is catching up but it is still at a higher level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that in the particular municipality where the Olympics are sited, Auburn, the unemployment level is significantly higher than in the other two councils areas that constitute that sub-region. There is a particular problem in regard to unemployment in this region. I took opportunity to write to some companies, trying to register with them the need to employ local labour to partly overcome this problem. There have been some embryonic efforts made by the Auburn Council but it tends to be a council with minimal staffing and really it has not focused enough on the problem. I have to say also that there have been some gestures by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to try to ensure that its local agencies provide a good part of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting in a broader sense Discussion Paper No. 3, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Creating jobs</EMPHASIS>, by Peter McDonald, where he said on page 30 when referring to this region and the north-west region of Melbourne:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both are old industrial areas which did not fare well in the shake-out that occurred in manufacturing industry in the early 1980s. Both have a large pool of unemployed persons in manufacturing, construction and transport. Taken together, these two areas alone contain almost 130,000 unemployed persons, about one in six of Australia's total of unemployed people and an even bigger proportion of those who are unlikely to benefit from current and future economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated on page 32:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is potential for redevelopment for the Ford site in Homebush . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is very close to the Olympics site. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mid-west of Sydney has two additional features which cannot be ignored. The first is the principal site of the Year 2000 Olympic Games is within the region. The second is that the region contains locations which can function as regional centres providing for the possibility of commercial expansion. This applies especially to Parramatta.</PARA>
<PARA>We have here the reality that there is very high unemployment. We have the presence of the Olympics but we have the possibility of actually doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Quarterly</EMPHASIS>, Winter 1995, in regard to the region and the related question of unemployment in the region, Phillip O'Neill and Robert Fagan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobs in the service sector provided most employment growth in the western suburbs between 1986 and 1991 but often remained inaccessible to retrenched manufacturing workers, especially from NESB groups, and young people although they were often located in the same or adjacent LGAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local geography exerts a major influence over people's access to waged work. Commuting costs have a major impact on the incomes of low-wage workers concentrated in lower-cost housing areas on the metropolitan fringes. Public transport is inadequate in western Sydney especially for cross-hauling between suburbs. Continued suburbanisation of economic activity has made this increasingly common in the 1990s. This discriminates severely against young people and women in one-car families. Using public transport can also become a security fear for people having to cope with the changing working hours, especially for part-time positions in manufacturing and retailing establishments. Information sources about employment opportunities both regionally and in the wider labour market are often relatively poor amongst the people most vulnerable to high unemployment rates. Finally, there is considerable anecdotal evidence, at least, of discrimination by prospective employees in the wider Sydney labour market against employing `westies' given their long journeys to work and social stereotyping.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, this Olympic site is in a region that has significant problems. More particularly, the unemployment problem in that region is related to the high proportion of people from a non-English speaking background. An article by Ian Burnley and James Forrest&mdash;coincidentally, in the same journal&mdash;about unemployment levels states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For males, there is a focus on the western (Parramatta, Blacktown, Penrith), southwestern (Bankstown, Liverpool, Campbelltown) and southern suburbs (Sutherland) . . . But there is a greater focus among females in the middle western suburbs: from Parramatta extending to Auburn and Ryde and northwestwards into Hornsby. These are not high unemployment areas for the general population, and emphasise therefore the particular impacts of birth place/gender disadvantage derived from occupational segregation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, I was absent, and not able to play a big role in the committee's inquiry but I can see the need to focus on the applicability of a lot of these suggestions to local hire and to working with companies and the CES to ensure that this stereotyping and discrimination against people in that region is overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the broader inquiry, I think it substantially deals with the major problems. It is worth noting what the report it has to say about the Olympics and what it will be providing. On page 5 of the summary it notes that, for the first time in Olympic history, all athletes will be housed in the Olympic Village at Homebush Bay, that the majority of venues will be within 30 minutes of the Olympic Village, that competition in 14 sports will be held at Homebush Bay, that 15,000 media people are expected to converge on Sydney, and that every night of the games 220,000 additional people are expected to be staying in Sydney. That gives us some dimensions of the issues and the possible ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important focuses of the Olympic planning of the previous state government, and it is being followed through by the new state government, is the concern with the environment. This inquiry notes the very good work done in respect of energy conservation and the use of renewable sources, water conservation, waste avoidance and minimisation, protecting human health, and protecting natural and cultural environments in the area. There has been significant remediation of what was once a very contaminated site due to a variety of uses for such things as abattoirs, timber yards, and fairly unsavoury industrial plants, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been very significant regeneration of Homebush Bay and, to a large degree, that was the reason that this site was chosen. It is worth noting the comments of Karla Bell from Greenpeace. I think we are aware that Greenpeace played a very substantial role in making sure that Sydney's bid was environmentally strong and therefore more viable for support. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no good just doing a bit of energy conservation because they have been doing that in Europe for 20 years . . . You have to leapfrog technologies, and you have to move into renewable technologies. It is no good doing tertiary treatment on sewage just because we do only primary at Malabar . . . What you have to do is waste water recycling et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA>She is focusing there on the possibilities in the environmental fields, and that relates again to Australian manufacturing industries. If we can get a bit of visibility, and a bit of success through this village, and through some of the companies that are connected with it, it is certainly good for what is an expanding international industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the consideration of the use of solar energy and energy efficient appliances, recycling surplus heating from airconditioning, the use of recyclable packaging and non-toxic materials, and the question of public transport and all those things, these games have provided a very strong focus for trying to maximise the advantages and minimise the unattractive outcomes from the environmental point of view. The inquiry report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.84<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, selling the success of the remediation project is critical. Controversy over the environmental credentials of the Sydney Olympics has the potential to damage public confidence in the Games and to adversely affect Australia's reputation on environment issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Given our rather poor performance at the Berlin conference on updates on global warming, anything we can do to improve our image is worth while. Specifically on the solar question, as people are aware, Australia did a lot of work on this aspect, and on page 33 the inquiry notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.91<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proponents of solar technology for the Olympic Games site foresee an impediment which the Commonwealth can help to overcome in relation to planning. To make the site a viable and environmentally sound urban development it is claimed that an energy audit is needed before other detailed planning is undertaken . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.92<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Dr Mills, an energy audit of the site is needed now to allow energy planning to proceed. To provide a platform for an innovative `environmental urban development', proper planning should require the addressing of energy requirements up front.</PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry is essentially saying that we have an industry in which Australia is at the head of the field&mdash;or has been traditionally, at least&mdash;and that this energy audit is a very serious requirement in relation to the general work that is being done on the environment of the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public transport has been briefly mentioned, and one of the issues that is on the agenda with the New South Wales state government is the question of whether there will be an in-out railway line or loop. This is a very important ingredient of the environmental issues of the games. Certainly, a loop in and out of the site would provide a lot quicker system, thus ensuring that the number of people using cars will be minimised. For the difference in the amount of money there is between the up-front costs of a simple one-track loop and the long-term costs, there can be no argument whatsoever but that we should go for that system which maximises public transport use and minimises car use within the games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestions of the inquiry cover a variety of issues that are really out there in the marketplace and are central to the games and their place in Australian industry. The committee has suggested that there be additional funding for an Olympics tourism marketing campaign. I do not think we need to elaborate upon the vital nature of tourism to Australia's gross domestic product. It is such that, this week in parliament, it is leading policy debate in large part in areas such as visa policy and the export market development grant changes. Once again, this committee is saying that tourism is a central requirement of the country and that there should be additional funding for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to broadcasting, we are quite aware that these Olympics will provide the most up-to-date technologies. Some of those that have been mentioned as having a lot wider applicability for the future are optical fibre, compressed digital video, multimedia, interactive media, digital television, and high-definition TV. The inquiry report says that there should be a strategy for the introduction of new broadcasting technologies to Australia in time for those Olympics. Both sides of politics are certainly aware of that massive requirement for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned&mdash;and this is, once again, a widely held view in Australia industry, and this particular committee has previously dealt with it&mdash;about the question of purchasing policy. The inquiry report says that there should be the collection and provision of information on the level of Australian industry involvement. Perhaps the committee could have been a bit more radical and could have pushed on the question of pressurising industry to actually do it. But at least it is a step in the right direction that we are saying that that information should be out there and available for public and industry knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have sought that an electronic commerce system for the Olympic Games be developed, and that there be an Olympic employment skills study. This study would involve actually finding out what skills are required so that, if any shortage is going to come on line, we do not deal with it in the normal, conventional fashion of this country by trying to bring in 5,000 Italian stonemasons or some such, but we actually get out there in the training sector and try, in advance, to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, this is an opportunity to promote Australian sporting expertise. As the economies of our region improve and the middle class grows in these countries, there is more demand and more concern for fitness and more access to sporting time, leisure, et cetera. These games provide Australia with an opportunity to market itself in those crucial fields and, of course, in the very closely related area of sporting equipment. The report essentially says that Australian industry should seek to maximise its opportunities, and it certainly covers the issue of the environmental standards that have been a major hallmark of this submission and the resulting successful application. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>
