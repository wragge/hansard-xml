<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of the Australian Embassy, Washington.</PARA>
<PARA>This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 29 June 1995, and the committee has duly reported back to this parliament. I had the pleasure recently of visiting Washington and attending at the Australian chancery which, of course, is the show place for our country in the United States of America. There is probably no more important chancery and it is vital, for the interest of Australia, that we be well presented there. It is an old building. It is not old in the heritage sense, but it was built some time ago and I am afraid to have to admit that it does not meet the high standards that I think are required of that important building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had long discussions at the time with Dr Don Russell, our ambassador in Washington&mdash;one of the finest representatives, I might add, this country has ever had to that country. He certainly has done a great deal for Australia's interests there while serving in that chancery. No doubt he will be doing a great deal more for Australia's interests when he comes back to Australia. He is one of the finest representatives I have known in my long political history in Australia and I think he has done this country proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the motion at hand, the main elements of the proposed works are: the demolition of the existing spiral staircase and the construction of a new stair, and the installation of a lift from level one, which is the ground floor, to level two for public and disabled access. One of the great problems with the design of this building is that it presents very badly to the public who walk straight in the door. The ambassador was very determined to use the hall space there, which is theatrette space in the front of the building and which is very useful and very attractive. The whole effect is ruined by the existing staircase which, I might add, does not assist with disabled access. So it is vital that we do something about this staircase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have for some time had architects seeking an aesthetic solution to the problem and I am very pleased to say, having had a look at the plans, that such a solution has been found. At the same time, the public will be able to get access to the library facilities and other facilities on the first floor. Disabled people, more importantly, will be able to get access to those facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the proposed works is the refurbishment of the core areas. Embassies these days are very crowded indeed. As you travel through the Washington embassy you find a great deal of congestion, particularly in the area where military attaches are. A lot of refurbishment is required. This will be done pursuant to this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element is the complete refurbishment of all seven floors, including new ceilings, office petitions, carpet, lighting, power and airconditioning. Many of the decisions that were made when this embassy was built were obviously based on cost cutting, because some of the ceilings, floor space and petitioning certainly would not meet Australian building standards. It has been necessary to refurbish them&mdash;to take out those particular ceilings and replace them with ones that meet modern building standards so that the building, for the benefit of its workers, can meet modern occupational health and safety standards. Also, I would specifically mention the building's power and airconditioning with which, apparently, there was a lot of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item is the installation of a sprinkler system from levels one through to seven. You could not imagine a modern Australian building not having a sprinkler system for fire safety. But, unfortunately, here we have our leading embassy in the world with no proper sprinkler system, so that is being installed. There is the replacement of the perimeter induction units with a new perimeter heating system and the installation of stair pressurisation to both fire-escape stairs. Washington gets pretty hot in the summer and there is the need for an adequate airconditioning system there. This installation of pressurisation associated with the fire-escape stairs is vital to maintaining a decent airconditioning system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also proposed to upgrade the communications centres for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence. There has been some joint use of those facilities, and the conditions in which the workers in the communications sections are working are very crowded and quite unsatisfactory. This upgrade will be welcomed by them. I always feel for people in our embassies who work in communications centres. They are very claustrophobic places indeed. They are high security areas, of course, and they are not easy places to work in. The upgrading here will be very useful for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item is the provision of a modern data and communications network throughout the building, something which is vital these days; and, finally, physical security works. Embassies these days are more and more concerned&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;with security matters, and Washington, unfortunately, is no exception. So the physical security works need to be upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interior of the chancery has not had a major refurbishment since being constructed in 1969. The building is magnificently located in Washington but the structure itself has many deficiencies. It certainly lacks that suitable fire protection and fire egress about which I was talking earlier. Major building services have reached the end of their design life and they do require replacement. The office layouts are very inefficient. The provision for current and future technology is quite inadequate, and the physical security protection is also deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total estimated cost for the works at November 1994 prices is $16 million. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is probably the hardest working committee&mdash;and I do not give them enough praise, I suspect. They put many motions through this House, causing them to work night and day. Certainly the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), their chairman, never stops working and never stops inspecting these public works and making very intelligent and creative comments about them. I think we should praise the committee here today. They have made the following conclusions in regard to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there is a need for a complete refurbishment of the Australian embassy building in Washington. This is necessary to ensure protection of the Commonwealth's investment in one of Australia's more significant overseas missions and to provide accommodation for staff which meets current standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it has been recommended that the Overseas Property Group continue to consult staff, the community and the Public Sector Union during the refurbishment program to ensure minimal disruption and inconvenience to staff and other users of the building. This will be a staged renovation. Of course, it is very expensive to have to find alternative accommodation in Washington while these buildings are being refurbished. It will be a staged floor-by-floor sort of arrangement. It is important that the union and the staff be consulted about the disruption and the inconvenience that will necessarily occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group, a unit of DAS, undertake an energy audit of the Washington embassy building following 12 months occupation of the refurbished building. Each time the Public Works Committee considers a new public works these energy issues are now carefully addressed and thought through to see that the design and construction meets the world leading standards in terms of energy saving. This has occurred on this occasion. The committee also recommends the refurbishment at the $16 million figure at November 1995 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note again the committee's recommendation that an energy audit for the Washington building be undertaken after 12 months of occupation. My department has agreed to undertake that review as it is part of the department's policy anyway, in Australia at least, and I think it should be part of our policy for overseas projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Overseas Property Group will continually consult the community and the Public Sector Union during the documentation and refurbishment. The program for the refurbishment will be undertaken over a 24-month period commencing on level seven and progressing down the building at a rate of approximately a floor every three months. The project delivery will entail calling tenders for work packages following full working documentation using a construction manager. An Australian based project manager will be posted to Washington for the duration of the works to oversee construction and to enable full-time consultation to continue between staff admission, contractors, consultants and the Overseas Property Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise to the House for spending a bit of time on this motion. It is a very important embassy and I think it is vital that it be properly discussed in this parliament. I thank the committee again for its report, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Naturally the opposition does not oppose the proposal to refurbish the Australian embassy in Washington. I recall well in my very late days in the foreign service and my very early days in parliament the transfer process between the old building and what was then the new building, which was commenced, as I recall, in 1969. In the Washington context, it was regarded as a great step forward in terms of Australian representation as well as being a very modern building at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with the passage of time, it is quite obvious that the fire protection and various other aspects of the current building are inadequate and therefore they do have to be brought up to date. The amount of $16 million, on the face of it, does seem to be a lot of money. I have not the slightest doubt that it will not come in finally at $16 million. It will probably be something well in excess of $20 million. Nevertheless, if Australia is going to have representation in what in fact is the `New Rome', then it must be structurally adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been somewhat critical of the fact that so much of the inner courtyard of the building, which is used for trade and other displays and so forth, is, to a very large degree, useless space or unused space for much of the time. It is fully airconditioned at no doubt considerable cost. I have always felt that the office staff who work in the embassy are working under pretty substandard conditions. Consequently, while this is an expensive project, it is one which clearly has to be undertaken in the interests of Australia's capacity to be well represented in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should take this opportunity to place on record my concern, and no doubt that of my colleagues, at the recent remarks of the out-going ambassador to Washington, Dr Don Russell. They were of a highly political and sensitive nature and quite clearly were not appropriate for a person in his office. He should not involve himself in political controversy at home while he is still representing Australia abroad. We are in no sense unhappy at the decision to bring him back. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new Chancery, Geneva.</PARA>
<PARA>This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 13 September 1995. The committee has now duly reported back to the parliament. The main elements of the proposed work are: the construction of a three-storey purpose-built chancery and a two-storey annex for lease to the New Zealand permanent mission, the construction of a conference centre, staff and visitor car parking, associated site works, services and landscaping. The total estimated cost for the works at December 1994 prices is $22.446 million. It is proposed to call select tenders and a single contract will be let for the construction of the building and the fit-out works. Subject to parliamentary approval, tenders will be invited in mid-1996 with all project works expected to be completed by January 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made certain recommendations in its report. The Australian chancery in Geneva comprises leased premises which are deficient in access, services, layout and space. This lease will expire in March 1999 and will not be renewed. There is a need for a new chancery building to be constructed for Australia's permanent missions in Geneva. The location and design of the new chancery are suitable. The concept of shared facilities with nations such as New Zealand could be extended to other projects when opportunities arise. There is an urgent need for a review of residential accommodation in Geneva. The review should examine ways in which the high recurrent expenditure for leased residential accommodation could be reduced. The review should also include an assessment of the costs and benefits associated with the acquisition or new construction of official residences and Australia based staff accommodation. The consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union should continue during the detailed design of the proposed development. The committee also recommends the construction of a new Australian chancery in Geneva at an estimated cost of $22.446 million at December 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to the House the innovative method by which this project will be financed. The new chancery will be provided using developer finance under deferred payment arrangements. Annual payments by the Commonwealth equivalent to the annual rental costs will be made to the financier over 20 years. This enables Australia to gain a valuable new asset on a budget neutral basis. We would have paid the same amount in rent, with the development finance being the responsibility of the financier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the committee's recommendations regarding the concept of shared facilities with nations such as New Zealand and the committee's view that it could be extended to other countries in future projects. I advise the House that this concept is already a matter of policy within my department. In the Overseas Property Group, opportunities for shared facilities with marker missions are thoroughly investigated for all new work proposals. My department has also taken note of the committee's recommendations to review residential accommodation in Geneva. The Overseas Property Group will investigate and report back to the PWC on this issue as soon as possible. I thank the committee for its report and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be mercifully brief on this point. The opposition does not oppose the proposition. Geneva is one of the most expensive cities in the world and in diplomatic terms it is one of the most active because it is through that office that much of our United Nations activity, especially with the UN agencies which are based in Switzerland, is conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the point made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) regarding the sharing of the facilities with other like-minded states. We are pleased that this is a government policy. I have been aware for some time that that is the case. There are obviously from time to time opportunities for Australia to develop projects in concert with countries such as Canada and New Zealand in particular, and perhaps on occasions other nations. The advantage of doing that is self-evident. If it is possible, for example, to buy a free-standing building and each of one of, say, three countries is able to take an adequate allocation of space in that building, and have common services such as security and so forth provided, there are obviously advantages to everybody, and certainly significant advantages to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA>The 1 Field Hospital at Holsworthy is an integrated General Reserve-Regular Army hospital which deploys to provide medical support to the army in the field during operations or training activities and recently supported the United Nations operations in Rwanda. When not deployed, the 1 Field Hospital will provide health care services to service personnel in the south-west Sydney region. </PARA>

In its report the committee recommended that the Department of Defence advise the committee of the results of a study being undertaken of training and sporting injuries in the Australian Defence Force which require medical treatment, to which the Department of Defence provided the following response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence confirms that a study is in progress of training and sporting injuries in the Australian Defence Force which require medical treatment. The study has been undertaken by the Surgeon-General to the Australian Defence Force. The Committee will be advised of the results of the study.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important development because I have personal knowledge of the injuries that occur, particularly with new recruits in the Defence Force who are put into very vigorous training programs.

<PARA>This proposal involves the provision of an increase in the current living accommodation on the base for 232 personnel to a total of 428 personnel and to replace existing unsuitable and substandard accommodation for 54 personnel. Proposed accommodation will provide a level of amenity consistent with community expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase in living-in accommodation will require a corresponding increase in messing facilities and car parking, and a new gymnasium to replace current substandard facilities which are beyond their economical life and unsuitable for extension to meet additional demand. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 24 October 1995, recommending the project at an estimated out-turn cost of $18.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their report the committee also raised the usual issues. The Department of Defence has noted all of the committee's recommendations and proposes the following actions in respect of them. Firstly, the scope of the work will be extended to provide a new formal entrance to the base should sufficient funds be available within the present project budget. Secondly, the use of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> as a triservice centre for living-in accommodation is one of a range of options currently under consideration for the provision of single accommodation for defence personnel in the Canberra area. Thirdly, Defence has initiated discussions with ACT Electricity and Water to review the possible use of grey water for irrigation of large scale landscape areas off site, such as playing fields. While large scale irrigation is outside the scope of the present project, tenderers for the present works will be encouraged to consider the reuse of waste water in developing cost effective proposals for the project.

<PARA>The ready reserve was established at government direction in 1992 to increase Australia's Defence Force capability to deploy trained personnel in shorter time scales than general reserve elements. This proposal will provide functional working accommodation for the ready reserve at Enoggera in Brisbane, replacing temporary and inappropriate accommodation and thus enhancing command and control, training and operational readiness. This requirement has been generated as a result of the introduction of a new capability for which there are not adequate facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee tabled their report on 24 October 1995, recommending the project and an estimated out-turn cost of $21.3 million. In their report the committee also raised an issue requiring the Department of Defence to undertake as soon as possible an energy audit to assess the efficiency of the existing energy management systems at Enoggera barracks. The committee is ever vigilant about these environmental and energy saving issues. The committee further requires the Department of Defence to make available to the committee the consultant's examination of energy consumption costs for this project to which the Department of Defence has provided the following responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The energy management system installed at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, in 1990 has achieved on average a reduction in electricity charges of about $6,000 a month. During this time, there has been continual development of the barracks which has increased the electrical load accordingly. New buildings are installed with electrical equipment which is connected with the energy management system. Noting that the design for the ready reserve facilities is preliminary, energy consumption costs can be analysed during design development with a view to maximising the efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence will forward this report on this examination to the committee. The committee's vigilance is already paying off, because $6,000 for one facility multiplied around the country is a huge saving to the taxpayers of Australia, to our environment and to the greenhouse gas effect. If approved, it is anticipated that construction will commence in early 1996 and be completed late in 1997. I would like to thank the committee for its report, and I commend the motion to the House.

<PARA>That quote is from Shakespeare and is entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry is the result of longstanding concern on the part of the Australian Parliament for the oppression of the Burmese people. This oppression manifested itself in the massacres which occurred in 1988. However, Burma's isolation has meant that, unlike the Tiananmen Square massacre, the world has only become slowly aware of the regime's brutal response to demands for democratisation. The failure to hand over power to the party which resoundingly won the election of 1990 and the arrest of over 80 of the successful candidates have outraged democracies around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then the SLORC has equivocated, procrastinated and obfuscated. It was the Burmese ambassador's justification of the regime which led the Australian Senate to refer the matter of human rights and progress towards democracy to the committee on 2 March 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion of this inquiry is that human rights continue to be grossly abused in Burma and there is no tangible progress towards democracy. Minimal changes have been made only in response to massive international pressure or at strategic times, just prior to a vote at the UN or an ASEAN ministerial meeting where Burma is seeking acceptance. Most changes have been superficial rather than structural, temporary rather than permanent. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose detention was a blatant political act and of doubtful legality according to internationally accepted standards of law, was released in July this year in just such circumstances: just prior to the ASEAN ministerial meeting and the meeting of the General Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gross abuses continue as I speak. The SLORC conscripts labour on a massive scale to work on infrastructure projects or to act as porters for the army. Villagers are threatened and beaten. They are forced to work excessive hours under military supervision. There is little food and no pay. Money is demanded under the guise of payment for equipment or taxes. Those who are willing or unable to continue have been beaten or shot. The rape of women is commonplace. No soldiers have been brought to account for the killing of civilians, whether forced labourers, porters or political dissidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equal disregard is paid to citizens' rights to their homes. The committee has heard of the forced relocation of villages in the way of tourist developments, gas pipelines or railway developments. There is no consultation, no notice given of the move and no compensation paid. Houses and whole villages have been burnt down. On the borders, the drug trade and the trafficking of women, girls and young men are a corrupting and debilitating influence on government, on the army and on the health and welfare of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These illegal trades also have a distorting effect on the economy. Moreover, any opposition to these practices has been met with spurious charges under executive decrees or vague legislation dealing with national security. Critics have been intimidated, spied upon, detained or tortured. Normal rights to free speech, a free press and freedom to associate are denied to the Burmese. Those changes that have occurred&mdash;the release of some political detainees, the abolition of military tribunals and the opening of the economy&mdash;have not addressed the core issues of accountability and democratic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of Burma, the SLORC, has variously denied that there is any abuse, complained about foreign interference in their internal affairs or pleaded special circumstances and cultural differences. The committee rejects these arguments. It takes the view that human rights are universal, applying to all people at all times. Burma, as a member of the United Nations, has obligations to uphold the universally defined standards of human rights. The mass of Burmese people&mdash;over 80 per cent of them&mdash;have resoundingly rejected the SLORC. Furthermore, where domestic governments such as Burma do not respect the will of their people or protect the rights of their citizens&mdash;or worse, where governments abuse their citizens&mdash;it is the right of the international community to seek to intervene to protect them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also believes that this inquiry has revealed the need for democratic political processes and the rule of law, interpreted by an independent judiciary, as the only reliable way of protecting rights and promoting development and security. It is the absence of accountability which makes governments corrupt and oppressive. Democracy, therefore, is not a luxury; it is essential. Burma's record clearly illustrates the interconnectedness of human rights, political democracy, peace, security and development. If minority rights had been respected in Burma and minorities included in the political processes, 40 years of war and the outflow of hundreds of thousands of refugees might have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes the key to change in Burma rests with the continuing efforts of those powers in the United Nations which have supported the many consensus resolutions on Burma. There should be no move to trade with or invest in Burma until there are substantial moves towards political reform&mdash;the release of all political prisoners, an end to forced labour and the establishment of genuine negotiations with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD. There should be restraint on investment by the multilateral financial institutions until these benchmarks are met. There should be a more constructive role from the ASEAN nations. The ASEAN nations are Burma's close neighbours and therefore they have the greatest interest in seeing a free, stable and secure Burma. Moreover, although it is yet to utilise it in this way, the ASEAN forum is an ideal place for the promotion of orderly regional development. There should also be continuing assistance to refugees along the borders until such time as they can return safely to a democratised Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have come late into this inquiry as chairman. I would like to acknowledge the chairmanship of former Senator Steve Loosley and the small band of subcommittee members dedicated to human rights who have enabled the change to be seamless and whose efforts are reflected in this report. I give thanks to the staff of the secretariat for their work in the preparation of this report&mdash;Ms Alison Carson, who brings order to a subcommittee that asserts its democratic right not to be always orderly, and our secretary, Ms Margaret Swieringa, whose sure-footed knowledge gently guides the committee and whose work in human rights enhances the reputation of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a dissenting report. I always have a conflict between wanting to correct the errors in a dissenting report versus giving it undue prominence, but I have opted to try to correct the dissenting report, which was submitted by Senator Dee Margetts, who is not a member of the subcommittee and whose views do not appear to be influenced by the evidence or the deliberations of the subcommittee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part, it is not in fact a dissent at all from the committee's conclusions or recommendations but a repetition of what the committee has already said. For example, recommendation 2, `That the Australian government "hold the line" on the benchmarks and not resume ministerial contact'&mdash;that is, not make official visits to Burma&mdash;`until significant progress is made on the benchmarks,' is both current government policy and the conclusion that the committee has come to in endorsing the benchmarks and urging that no further concessions be made to the SLORC until the benchmarks are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts recommends that the government develop a code of conduct for Australian business. This is already recommended by the committee in recommendation 30(b)(iii). On the other hand, Senator Margetts recommends to the government things they are already doing&mdash;for example, recommendation 1 of the dissent, which is that any ministerial contact be limited to multilateral fora outside Burma. Ministerial contact is already limited to this, and the committee has not suggested any change to the current practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the country economic brief of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Margetts criticises the lack of human rights assessment in the brief and argues against an `ingenuous' defence of the brief as a purely economic document. The committee's report already does this at paragraph 6.66 and at no time seeks to defend the brief in terms of its limited intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most disturbing of all is the suggestion in recommendation 4 that the Australian government recognise Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as the rightful leader of democratic Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi is the General Secretary of the NLD. Dr Sein Win is the Prime Minister, in exile, of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Margetts opposes the committee's recommendations that, at all opportunities, the international community and ASEAN members in particular press the SLORC towards political reform. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the international community should take its lead from Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and not move to greater levels of dialogue than she is willing to engage in herself.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a meaningless recommendation and a complete misunderstanding of the position of Aung San Suu Kyi, who since her release has been willing and offering to engage in a dialogue with the SLORC on constitutional matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, SLORC have refused to include her in any substantial talks on political reform. It is vital that the rest of the international community press the SLORC to include her as soon as possible. Senator Margetts confuses dialogue&mdash;pressure and criticism&mdash;an essential aspect of trying to shift the SLORC, with engagement&mdash;a process of recognition of trade and investment as a means of bringing about economic driven change. The committee endorses the first but rejects the second. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Although I have not been a member of the inquiry into Burma by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I want to make some brief references. As no other members of the opposition are present in the chamber to speak on this matter, I thought I should not let the opportunity pass. Many members on both sides of this chamber have been concerned for many years about the situation that has developed in Burma. We are well aware of the high profile and the publicity surrounding Aung San Suu Kyi's arrest and the events that have followed since her successful election win some years ago which was denied her by the SLORC when the military dictatorship continued to exercise authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall visiting Burma back in 1970-71 and meeting then a former prime minister of Burma who was also under house arrest. As has been pointed out correctly in this report, sadly Burma does have a long history of authoritarian rule and isolation from international contact and international scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the end of the Second World War there have been constant incidents along Burma's borders involving the hill tribes and the communities in that area which, for one reason or another, have felt themselves to be isolated and ignored by the central administration in Rangoon. But the principal point, I think, which this report correctly points out, is that, in terms of political reform, it must remain a central objective of Australia's foreign policy towards Burma that some reform takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much pressure has been exerted in recent years not only on Burma directly but also on the nations of ASEAN which have in a sense had a somewhat more sympathetic attitude towards Burma. The view of ASEAN has been that Burma is part of the community of South-East Asia and that the best way to solve the problem is to incorporate Burma in ASEAN. Burma is now progressing towards membership of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, this is a typical example of the conflict which takes place and will continue between Australia, as a modern liberal democracy, and our approach to issues of political reform and human rights in many nations within our region. I am one of those who believe that ultimately the security of this nation is going to heavily depend on our capacity to surround ourselves with countries which accept the principles of democracy and the basic principles of human rights as enshrined in the United Nations' charters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, clearly, it is going to take some time to reach that stage. There are a number of our neighbours who take the view that internal affairs are not the responsibility of international fora and certainly not the business of their neighbours. So we will have to continue to tread a fairly light path in terms of how we handle these issues. But I urge this parliament, as I shall not be in it indefinitely, to always take the view that nations will support and respect Australia for its integrity and its determination to do what we believe is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in diplomacy one is constantly faced by the issue of Realpolitik, the ultimate equation is that the security and safety of humanity will depend on the capacity of all governments to give their peoples a degree of security and respect for the integrity of their activities and their actions towards individuals&mdash;which we generally regard as human rights. But, unfortunately, in many parts of the world, and certainly Burma is one of the most notable ones, the conceptions of human rights as we understand them are quite clearly not evident. They have not been evident for a long time and I am not optimistic to believe that that situation will change in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, that is not an excuse for lowering one's objectives, determination and resolve to try to develop a community of nations in the Asia-Pacific region where the conceptions of human rights and the responsibility of governments to their peoples, particularly to the rights of minorities, are respected. On that basis, and on that basis alone, I think this report is a very useful contribution to this continuing debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make another point and to put it forward as a suggestion, which I note is not in the report. I have read reports that there has been some tenuous connection in recent times between the government of Myanmar&mdash;or Burma, now that it has changed its name&mdash;and the secretariat of the Commonwealth of Nations. I find this an interesting prospect, because Burma is the only former British colony in our part of the world which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the prospects may be somewhat dim at this stage, nevertheless, I hold out the hope that if there is one thing the Commonwealth of Nations has successfully achieved in its long and fairly illustrious history&mdash;as we have seen in the case of South Africa&mdash;it is the capacity of that organisation to garner significant international support through the United Nations and elsewhere directly in achieving those fundamental human rights of which I speak. Therefore I take the view that, if there is anything that can be done to involve Burma in the Commonwealth of Nations, that may well be a step in the right direction and one which the Australian government should pursue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In this month's issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Way</EMPHASIS>, the magazine of Qantas, there is an article entitled `The Land of the Gold Pagodas'&mdash;a very sympathetic and flattering portrayal of Burma. And, as we thumb through the many glossy magazines today, we come across articles extolling the charms and the beauty of Burma, usually accompanied by glossy photographs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year is the Year of Tourism in Burma and people from throughout the world will be enticed to visit this beautiful but tragic country. But beneath the beauty of the gold pagodas lies a frighteningly brutal regime and, as has been so adequately outlined by the chairman, Burma has been gripped with terror and frightening brutality for many years. The land, far from being a paradise, is a country where people's human rights and dignity are trampled under with jackboot, ruthless organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us hear nothing from the apologists. We heard some during the hearing saying that things are improving, there are administrative efficiencies, but these people never explained why the rightful ruler was under house arrest for so long, why basic democratic freedoms were abolished and why people disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of human rights represents not simply a moral imperative, although it rests upon the inherent dignity of human beings; it is driven by a pragmatic recognition that the abuse of human rights retards development by causing instability and insecurity, oppression, rebellion, war and the outflow of refugees. Such consequences affect the vital interests of neighbouring countries and entitle them to scrutinise the policies of other governments as far as those policies affect the human rights of their citizens. Let us also hear nothing from those businesses which want to enforce and make their profits from the blood of the innocent Burmese people. Let us not hear the nonsense that politics and business should be separated. They cannot and will not be separated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman has outlined the view of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on trade and investment with Burma. Let me say life has been cheap in Burma&mdash;nasty, brutish and, far too often, short. If we are truly international citizens, we must not close our eyes and look away from the brutality that is Burma today. Human rights are the rights we have because we are human beings. They do not belong to us because we are Australian or, indeed, Burmese, Chinese or American, and therefore they cannot be modified or coloured by our nationality, our historical experience or our culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any Australians who visit Burma, be they former prime ministers or backpackers, are supporting an evil, brutal regime. As we have rightly loudly condemned the French for their arrogant behaviour in the Pacific, so must we continue to loudly raise the issues of Burma. If the Burmese are serious about tourism, let us or those who go there visit some of the border camps. Let them talk to the military and let the Burmese explain the disappearances and the brutality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The gap between the statements made by various representatives of the Burmese government and the actual conditions of life for ordinary Burmese people appears to be very wide&mdash;very wide indeed. For the most part, the worst conditions are not matters that can be attributed to poverty or levels of development or different Asian values. They are often attributable to government policy or to the direct actions of the government or individual military commanders. They result from a lack of accountability. Where there is no domestic accountability, then the only possibility for the protection of people who are abused by their government is through the international system, flawed as it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Human rights are denied in Burma. Any progress towards democracy is very slow and it is a tragedy in today's world, where so much has been achieved in so many ways, that so little progress has been made towards the protection of basic human rights in so many parts of the world, especially Burma. I agree with the comments made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) who said that many of the neighbours of Burma regard it as an Asian concept and feel that we should not interfere. I take the view that, like apartheid, there is a growing body of international customary law that says some things are above domestic concerns. As apartheid was regarded as above article 2.4 of the UN charter and became a concern for the international community, so indeed should the denial of human rights be a matter of concern for the whole international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers in Burma do not have basic labour rights. Despite the ratification of the ILO conventions, there is no freedom of association, no right to strike, no functioning trade unions and no right to bargain on wages. The international trade union movement always lists Burma as one of the countries in which child labour is endemic, and that matter has also been raised in this House over recent months. The government sets wages unilaterally in the public sector, while private sector wages are set by the market. Wage increases continued to lag far behind inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned about the ILO conventions concerning seafarers. In 1993 complaints were made to the ILO by the International Transport Federation about the contracts and conditions of 30,000 Burmese seamen. The nature of seafaring has changed and labourers have been brought from many other countries. All seamen come under the control of the government's employment control division for seamen. They are required to sign contracts which state that the seamen will not contact the International Transport Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, the ILO committee on freedom of association heard a series of cases of the alleged abuse and intimidation by the Burmese government of Burmese seamen serving on foreign ships flying flags of convenience. In the period between 1987 and 1993, while in ports in the United States, Germany, Sweden and Australia, the seamen had complained about very poor conditions and underpayment. The response of the government of Burma involved revocation of registration, confiscation of passports, threats of imprisonment, threats against families and possibly kidnapping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One case of particular significance for Australia concerned the interception in 1993 of 11 Burmese seamen by the Burmese authorities in the transit lounge at Singapore airport and their forcible repatriation to Burma. It was claimed in the Singapore parliament by the home affairs minister that, in response to a request from the Burmese embassy, on behalf of the Burmese foreign ministry and the Star Corporation Shipping Company, the first secretary of the Burmese embassy had persuaded the Qantas airport duty manager to assist him to seize the passports of the 11 seamen and hold them until their departure to Rangoon. These seamen have disappeared. This action is a disgrace for Qantas, and Australia should be ashamed to have been associated with this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who took over at a very late stage but who has carried on the strong traditions of the previous chairman, former Senator Loosley, who brought a particular skill to the foreign affairs and defence committee and a particular sympathy and feeling for human rights. I know that that is a feeling which the current chairman will carry on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes very sobering reading, and I believe it is necessary reading for every Australian. I pay tribute also to the secretariat staff, particularly Alison Carson and Margaret Swieringa. I congratulate Margaret Swieringa on the dedication that she brings and the work that she puts into this committee. I do not know anyone in this parliament who has a deeper concern about the denial of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to make one or two comments about the dissenting report. It is very difficult when you are talking about human rights, the denial of human rights and the denial of democracy to criticise someone who puts in a dissenting report. Nevertheless, I do not deny anyone on any committee the right to put in a dissenting report. What annoys me is the fact that committee members spend hours and hours travelling around the country and taking evidence from all over Australia in an attempt to reach consensus. I know former Senator Loosley was also very concerned about this matter. Whenever we organised the final draft of a report, he always had the ability&mdash;as does the current chairman&mdash;to bring consensus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, no report ever brought down in parliament, when we have opposition, government and independent members on a committee, involves no compromise. At times we all have to compromise. We do not get everything we want. But it would be better to be able to stand up in this parliament and bring down a report which has the backing of all members of a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every committee to do with foreign affairs, defence and trade that I have served on with Senator Margetts has had a dissenting report from her&mdash;and she is always wrong. She did not attend the committee hearings. She did not sit through any of the report draftings. This dissenting report lowers the value of the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great respect for Senator Margetts&mdash;I like her personally&mdash;but sometimes people in this parliament try to be purer than the pure. We all aspire to certain things. Sanctimonious statements are often wrong or not well researched. This dissenting report is not as bad as some; nevertheless, I often wonder why there is a need for these dissenting reports. If people are so interested, why do they not attend when we are working through the matter or come to the hearings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I commend this report to the House. People should read the dissenting report and make of it what they will. This is an important report. I think we first brought this down at the time the member for Bradfield was on the committee. I think it is a sobering report that should be read by every member of this parliament. It will, I believe, cause them to pause and think. If anyone is planning to visit Burma in the Year of Tourism in Burma, I really do think they should think again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself covers a whole range of things in relation to human rights and the progress towards democracy in Burma. I wish to comment that&mdash;it is very relevant to this report&mdash;last month I was on a parliamentary delegation to Thailand, as part of a bilateral visit to Thailand and the IPO conference in Singapore, which was chaired by the Deputy Speaker, Mr Jenkins. The deputy chair of that delegation was the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). It was a very interesting opportunity for us to see what is actually going on in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took the opportunity, when we were at Mae Sot in the north, to visit a refugee camp on the Thai-Burma border. That visit is very relevant to this particular report. That was one of the things the Deputy Speaker particularly wanted us to do. It was a very important occasion for us, as sad as looking at such an area like that is. This camp had some 6,000 occupants. People had been there for 11 years. Naturally enough, there were a lot of young children there. They had obviously been born there in the time their parents had been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very staggering experience for us to witness that. When you go on these parliamentary delegations, you often hear the silence from your colleagues as you leave. That spells out just how moved we felt about this great tragedy on the border. I understand that on the Thai-Burma border there are some 90,000 refugees, often called displaced people. Similarly, on the Burma-Bangladesh side there are something like 250,000 displaced people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare the numbers of refugees in those situations with the numbers of refugees who are arriving in boats here on our shores in Australia, we have to wonder when a lot of the reaction from Australians is, `Turn them around and send them back.' When we consider the problem that Thailand is facing with those sorts of numbers of people on their border, I think the sorts of difficulties that some of these countries face really come home to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular report there are many references to the government of Thailand and the work they are doing. I would like to record my appreciation for the support we had when we were there. The cooperation we had, enabling us to go to this camp, was pretty important. To the credit of the Thai government, they were very cooperative and gave us every assistance we needed. They are doing a lot of good work in assisting those people in those unfortunate situations, and I think it should be acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report talks about the Australian government urging the government of Thailand to take certain steps&mdash;and I think it is important for us to do that. But this is not just a problem for Thailand; it is a problem for the whole world. I think that is where the responsibility lies when we see those sorts of difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other references here that I also wish to pick up. One is the problem, particularly in Thailand and Burma, of the HIV-AIDS virus and the work that Australia's aid program, AusAID, is doing. I would compliment our people who are working in Thailand, particularly those with AusAID. I would also compliment the NGOs where AusAID is also involved in Burma. They are doing a tremendous job under extremely difficult circumstances. It is certainly a process of education. There is no doubt about that. Many people are trying to assist in overcoming that major international health problem. I also express my appreciation for the cooperation being extended from a lot of other similar organisations to our people with AusAID. We also had the opportunity to discuss these issues with a British woman in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report is very timely, following on from our visit there. Whilst I have been on this committee only since 6 June&mdash;interestingly enough, I have just taken note of the date here&mdash;I felt it important that, when this report came before the committee, I take the opportunity to make mention to the committee of our recent parliamentary trip there. Of course, the report on that trip has not yet been finalised, but it will be tabled at a later date. I am sure that report will make interesting reading compared with what has been highlighted in this report. </PARA>

They put a tremendous effort into the committee work, and that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the member for Chifley, the chairman of the committee, I would also offer my compliments. You have only been chairing the committee for a short time, but I recognise, as has the member for Throsby, the hard work you have put into getting across the issues here. The report is a great compliment to you and the entire committee who participated in its preparation.

As an observer delegation there, we had the appropriate dialogue session with those people. Breaking down those barriers, with us being more and more heavily involved in Asia, really is important.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;These two reports have been tabled together. I have notes on both of them, so I will deal with them separately. Some of my other colleagues will wish to comment on them as well. I am pleased to have the opportunity to present <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 339&mdash;Annual report of activities 1994-95</EMPHASIS> on behalf of the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It has been a particularly busy year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, which is the 339th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year. The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports to parliament in 1976. The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reporting this way to Parliament, the Committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This Committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and has been in the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement is as valid today as it was in 1979. The last year has been particularly busy for the committee. During the period, it tabled seven reports, which was two more than in the previous financial year. The most significant of the reports tabled was report 331, which contains results of the committee's review of the package of the three bills intended to replace the Audit Act 1901 and the committee's consideration of the government's proposal to establish an audit committee of parliament. Report 331 contained 39 recommendations to further enhance this package. The committee was gratified to see that the government adopted the vast majority of those recommendations. I will comment further on that report in my statement here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will know that, some 13 months after the tabling of the committee's report, the three bills and the motion to establish an audit committee are still being debated in the parliament. The contentious issues remain the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct performance audits in government business enterprises, the extent of the parliament's involvement in the appointment process for Auditors-General, the most appropriate form for an audit committee and certain provisions relating to the disclosure of sensitive information. The committee remains of the view that the recommendations in report 331 on these matters are sensible and constructive solutions which ought to be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has before it a rare opportunity to modernise the Commonwealth's financial management and accountability framework. If we do not reach agreement on the outstanding matters in the next two weeks and enact legislation before the end of this session of parliament, the opportunity will pass, and pass very sadly I would suggest. This would be a great tragedy and, because of the upcoming election and the priorities of a new government coming in, particularly with the new budget timetable, the reforms contained in the bills will go unmade until at least July 1997. There are already a lot of aspects that depend very much on this legislation, particularly when it comes to the FMA and the CAC bills. A delay of this magnitude will be to the detriment of good management in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to urge all parties to look very closely at the hard work that has gone into that particular report. That report came out of the committee's report 296 back in 1989. It has taken some considerable time to even get it before this place, let alone trying to get it through the Senate. I think it would be a great tragedy if we failed to get that through in this parliament because of its magnitude&mdash;the importance of modernising our legislation to bring things up to the mark. I hope all parties involved will take this opportunity to move progressively with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the eventual outcome of the debates in the Senate and the House, the committee considers that its review demonstrates that parliamentary committees can make valuable and timely contributions to the legislative process and help ensure that legislation is of the highest quality. Other committees of this parliament are now having more of an input into legislation and the opportunity to review it. Many bipartisan views have come back, and that has been a great strength to this parliament. The fact that the government has moved in that direction and encouraged and supported it will be seen as an important development in this parliament when one goes through the history books in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the year the committee also tabled report 336 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. That was an inquiry into commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector, which is a very important subject. In this major report the committee concluded that commercialisation and corporatisation have led to major improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness with which Commonwealth agencies provide goods and services. However, the committee found that commercialisation has not been without its cost and, in some cases, the transition could have been managed better. Of course, it is the role of the committee to highlight any deficiencies that we see. We hope that our reports can only improve the way departments operate&mdash;in particular, commercialisation in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other reports tabled during the year covered a diverse range of topics, including the use of the Australian government credit card by Commonwealth agencies. This was a particularly interesting subject. I suggest that our report has shown up a lot of deficiencies in the way we were doing things with credit cards. I know that the Department of Finance in particular has picked up on some of those issues to improve things. Interestingly enough, when we visited New Zealand we found that our work in that report had spread over there. When we were there we were asked to speak to some people on the subject. Obviously that is something that flows across the Tasman to other jurisdictions. The committee was able to play an important part in assisting in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important report of the committee concerned the sale of Aussat and best practice for the sale of Commonwealth assets. A further report related to the construction and acquisition of six new Collins class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy, which is a major project. Because of that we need to watch it very closely. The Department of Defence is doing that as well and ensuring that the project is completed. The overall cost of the project is quite outstanding and we certainly need an ongoing brief to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also active during the year with several ongoing and new inquiries. These included inquiries into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. That is another very interesting area. A report on cash management in the public sector has been tabled today. We also looked at accrual reporting, whole of government reporting and fiscal responsibility legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only this morning that the committee was working on that and took the opportunity to have an international link-up with Washington DC. We spoke to some of our American friends on the impact in that area. It was a very successful operation and obviously was a first for one of the parliamentary committees. I hope that other committees can take up that opportunity in the future. I know that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who chairs the Standing Committee on Procedure and is a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, is interested in how we can best use the new technology in expanding our operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports of some of these inquiries have been tabled and it is planned to table reports on the remainder of the inquiries before the end of the session. It depends on how hard the committee works the chairman. We will see how we go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major highlight of the committee's year, as I mentioned before, was a visit to New Zealand as part of the committee exchange program established by the Australian and New Zealand parliaments. The centrepiece of the visit was a meeting between the committee delegation and the New Zealand parliament's equivalent of the JCPA&mdash;the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The meeting provided the delegation with an overseas perspective on some common issues facing the two committees. The discussion revolved around the role of committees in the New Zealand parliament, New Zealand's experience of public sector reforms and the relationship between parliaments and their auditors-general. That was a particularly interesting discussion in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in New Zealand the committee delegation also met with a number of other individuals and organisations. I mentioned earlier that we spoke to people about credit cards. The New Zealanders were particularly interested in the work we had done in that area. The purpose of these additional meetings was to gain a New Zealand perspective on some of the issues facing the JCPA's inquiries in Australia. I think we both benefited from that mutual exchange. Some people from New Zealand had been to Australia before and we had the opportunity to renew friendships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this report I was pleased to have the opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest with our counterparts on the New Zealand Finance and Expenditure Committee. Also, a great number of public and private sector representatives were invaluable in assisting the ongoing inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also involved in a watching brief over the tax bill improvement project. That is a task the committee will be continuing through 1995-96. It comes out of the committee's previous report on the Australian Taxation Office. It is something of great importance to this parliament and the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Nolan, who is leading the tax bill improvement project, should be congratulated on the work that he and his committee have taken on. It is a very challenging task for anyone. The commitment that Brian has put into it is amazing because it is not an easy task by any means. I congratulate him on his efforts and the way he keeps his cool with all his critics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud of the committee's achievements over the past 12 months. I thank my colleagues on the committee for their unstinting efforts and active involvement in the committee's activities. Their work over the last 12 months has more than upheld the JCPA's tradition of helping to keep the executive accountable to parliament, which is an important role of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to report No. 340, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cash management in the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>. It is a pleasure, on behalf of the committee, to table that report this morning. This was another very important issue for the committee to pick up on and I would like to make a few comments about it. This report is a result of the committee's review of two Auditor-General's reports presented to the parliament&mdash;Audit Report No. 22 1993-94, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit: Cash management in Commonwealth government departments</EMPHASIS> and Audit Report No. 10 1994-95, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit: Cash management in Commonwealth government departments</EMPHASIS>. Both audit reports resulted from the same performance audit, the first being an interim report and the second being the final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's decision to review these reports was influenced by the same reasons which caused the Auditor-General to conduct the audit: first, the Commonwealth manages huge amounts of cash each year; secondly, any improvements in cash management practice would potentially result in substantial dollar savings, which is something all members of parliament and the general public are very conscious of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, good cash management endeavours to match patterns of expenditure with patterns of revenue. In the Commonwealth, responsibility for this task is shared between individual agencies, which deliver programs or collect revenues, and the central economic agencies, being the Department of Finance and Treasury, which are involved in forecasting overall cash needs and engaging in short-term cash borrowings when cash holdings are predicted to be insufficient to cover forthcoming payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When short-term borrowings are made, the Commonwealth incurs an interest expense known as public debt interest expenditure. In recent years, transactions to fund public debt interest expenditure have been the single biggest source of real growth in Commonwealth outlays. For example, the budget papers for 1995-96 show that, while public debt interest expenditure is expected to decline in future years, the past two years have seen such expenditure grow from $6.65 billion to $10.08 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a strategic level, good cash management involves the prompt banking of Commonwealth revenues and the development of payment schedules which recognise opportunity costs and revenue peaks. The scale of the task is immense. In 1995-96, Commonwealth revenue is expected to total $110 billion while outlays are expected to amount to $122 billion. Figures like that merely confirm that there is a need to pay special attention to cash management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the revenue side, it is important that the Australian Taxation Office and the other revenue agencies have sophisticated systems in place to quickly process and bank incoming receipts, which in peak periods can amount to more than $1 billion per day. With the $110 billion revenue for 1995-96 that I mentioned before, it would be obvious that there would be those peaks. It is very important that we use every avenue available to ensure that those receipts are banked and processed very quickly. I believe very strongly in the new technologies that are available, particularly in the banking sector, and we should really capitalise on those to pick up on that very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the expenditure side, Commonwealth agencies need to pay far more attention than they have in the past to making payments in a way which not only meets the Commonwealth's program objectives but at the same time protects the Commonwealth's financial interests. This is true both of the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays and of the Commonwealth's payments to the states, which in 1995-96 were estimated to be $34.2 billion or a little less than one-third of the total outlays. They are the payments that go to the states every year. It is very important that we think about that in terms of cash flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's current inquiry into the administration of specific purpose payments to the states&mdash;which I mentioned earlier when tabling the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Annual report of activities&mdash;</EMPHASIS>has drawn particular attention to the significant cash management implications of specific purpose payments. There is ample evidence, for example, that by making specific purpose payments before they are needed for program purposes the states are able to invest the money and make significant interest windfalls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That might not necessarily be a problem, and I am sure the states think it is a good move. But, in effect, this is a form of hidden subsidy to the states. It is an issue I expect the committee to return to in the report of its SPP inquiry, which will be tabled before the end of the current parliamentary session. That is an important thing to dwell on. That interest windfall comes to the states. But why? This is why we need to look at the cash flow. It does not only refer to the states; it refers to any particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which is crucial for effective cash management is the need to accurately forecast cash flows. It is this activity which enables the containment of public debt interest expenditure. The committee has recommended the establishment of a series of cash forecasting benchmarks based on national and international best practice in both the public and private sectors. Treasury should also routinely monitor and evaluate its cash forecasting performance against these best practice benchmarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a great number of agency level functions which can have a marked aggregated impact across the Commonwealth, and they need to be addressed as well. These agency level functions include: negotiation of prepayment terms, particularly for specific purpose payments to the states and territories; invoicing promptly for goods and services sold; expediting collection of amounts due; purchasing goods or services later without jeopardising program objectives; negotiating more favourable purchase payment terms; reducing the amount of inventory held; spreading payment terms; and paying invoices only when they fall due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that last point, I am well aware that it was often argued the other way&mdash;that the Commonwealth, and the states for that matter, were not always paying their invoices on time. Not paying them early can also have an adverse effect. There needs to be that balance. The private sector used to often complain that the Commonwealth did not always pay its invoices on time. So you need to make sure that it is a two-way game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key message of course is that all agencies have a role in maximising the Commonwealth's cash management outcomes. Only efficient and effective management of these day-to-day functions by departments will achieve the levels of cash balances necessary to minimise borrowing and, subsequently, the net public debt interest cost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth agencies maintain over 2,000 bank accounts, and it was of great concern to the committee that the Australian National Audit Office had discovered that several agencies were unaware of the number of accounts they maintained. It is an essential discipline, of course, that proper bank accounts and records be maintained. To do otherwise is an indication of extreme laxity on the part of agency managers and exposes Commonwealth funds to significant risks. It is important in all of these areas that we minimise that risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering how cash management might be improved across all Commonwealth agencies, the committee came to the view that the potential for savings, the number of issues involved in good cash management and the absence of any whole of government monitoring or analysis pointed to the need for increased central focus in the Commonwealth, at least in the short term. Accordingly, the committee recommends in report 340 that Finance should play a more prominent role in providing guidance for line agencies as well as in the monitoring, analysis and reporting of cash management performance on a Commonwealth-wide basis. The central focus on cash management recommended in the report could result in Finance performing a corporate Treasury function for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues to emerge during the committee's review was whether or not the group of accounts maintained by the Commonwealth at the Reserve Bank of Australia and used for targeting of cash balances was the most appropriate. Evidence provided to the committee suggested that, in practice, the target group of accounts has already been expanded by Treasury to include the overdraft group. As this wider group is the one which is used by the Reserve Bank to calculate the Commonwealth's interest bill, it seems logical to the committee that the target group should be formally expanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An associated and perhaps more important issue is the level of balances in these target accounts. The government decided in 1989 that the average cumulative balances in the target accounts should be maintained in the $0 to $300 million range. The committee believes that there is now scope to further refine this target range&mdash;towards the lower end, of course&mdash;thus providing additional savings. The committee recommends that Finance and Treasury should discuss and agree on optimal cash balances or, alternatively, that the issue be resolved by a review process. Of course the initiative taken in 1989 was right, and the Department of Finance has been doing a lot of good work in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the final issue in this report which I wish to address. In the audit reports the Auditor-General pointed to areas where better cooperation between Finance and Treasury could result in an improved cash management performance. Report 340 looks in more depth at the relationship between these two key central agencies. The report reflects the concerns of committee members that a number of important issues which appear to have been under discussion or review for some years have yet to be satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Better cooperation and communication between Finance and Treasury could have seen a number of these issues resolved some time ago, with consequent benefit to the Commonwealth. Whilst both the committee and the Auditor-General acknowledge that there has been improvement in the working relationship between Finance and Treasury since the audit began, the committee believes there is scope for further cooperation. I think we would all acknowledge that in any area there is always the opportunity for us to do things better. I very much appreciate the efforts of the Department of Finance, particularly the cooperation and assistance we have had from it on not only this occasion but many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the range and significant nature of the issues requiring resolution, the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) should commission a high-level review of cash management in the Commonwealth. The review team should have a chairman from the private sector with expertise in corporate treasury functions. I believe that is particularly important, and I will come back to the reason why in a moment. It should consist of senior representatives from the Department of Finance and the Treasury; it is obviously logical to have those departments involved, seeing as they are the ones that deliver the services. It should include a senior representative from the Australian National Audit Office as a member of the review team or as an observer; it is essential that we include the Australian National Audit Office in anything like this. It would need to focus on the cash management issues which remain unresolved, and report within six months of being established&mdash;it only stands to reason that we need to report back on those as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that such an externally led review would enable a fresh perspective to be brought to the issues&mdash;a perspective unencumbered by interagency sensitivities. This is an important recommendation dealing with an important issue. The size of the Commonwealth's public debt interest bill and the potential savings which could flow from better case management are too big to ignore. I  personally believe that this recommendation is the key to the whole question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would be aware that from my background in the banking industry I have some interest in what cash flows are all about. Anyone in business would understand that if you do not control your cash flow you will have to pay unnecessary interest. If anyone in business, not only in the banking industry, has an overdraft and is not getting their payments in on time or promptly they will have to pay unnecessary interest. That is very relevant to this question. Anyone in business knows the importance of promptly making the outward payments. It is important to get someone in from the private sector with a wide depth of knowledge and experience. There are lots of those senior people around, and I think they could offer great assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the former chief executives from the banking industry, which I mentioned I came from, would always have known, particularly from the involvement of any bank employee, of the need to ensure that those cash flows are maintained. Overnight cash balances are very important to any industry, and it is always very relevant that the banks ensure that they use their money to the greatest benefit of their shareholders&mdash;and they still do, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need someone from the private sector to lead that review. There are certainly many people who come to mind&mdash;although I will not name them in this place in case I create some problems for them&mdash;in the major corporate areas who could offer that sort of expertise in order to assist the Department of Finance and the Treasury as to how we can better manage these things. I am not saying that the Department of Finance is not doing a good job. It has put a lot of effort into this, but there are always better ways to do things. That is what the committee is aiming for in this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points we have made in this report are raised in the interests of better government. They pick up a lot of the things that the Auditor-General highlighted in both his reports. They will ensure that we have better cash management and reduce the public debt interest bill. There is no way we will ever get completely away from the public debt interest bill, because there are government programs that have to be met on a day-to-day basis, let alone those that occur on a one-off basis. But it is incumbent on all departments&mdash;such as the Department of Employment, Education and Training, with its labour market programs&mdash;to ensure there is a cash flow and that they are not making payments before they are due. They should make progress payments, just as anyone in any business would make such payments, rather than paying everything up front. I am aware that in some agencies that does happen. It is something that all departments need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is a very important report. I hope it will receive serious consideration by the government. It comes back to the size of the government's public debt interest bill and the potential savings that could flow from better cash management. Those are the important areas that we highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I express our thanks to those people who contributed to the report by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearings. I thank the staff of the secretariat who, as I mentioned earlier, have made such an important contribution. I particularly thank Wayne Harrison, who was with us for this report. He brought a wealth of knowledge to the committee and helped us tremendously, as did the whole secretariat, as usual. We are very fortunate in this parliament in the quality of staff on the various committees. I thank them, along with my colleagues, who have worked so hard on this report. I look forward to their helping me finish the rest of our reports before the end of this parliament. I commend both reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to make a very short comment about both these reports. I refer first to the annual report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I suppose it is important at this stage in the life of the 37th parliament that we recognise some of the work that the JCPA has done in the last 2 1/2 or so years and the direction in which the inquiries have taken our committee. Certainly, as a new member of parliament since 1993, I have been interested in the focus that has been taken by the committee on public policy matters, such as commercialisation and privatisation, and the accountability and transparency of what the Commonwealth is doing. A lot of our reports in that period which appear in the annual report revolve around those topics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it goes without saying that a lot of the reports and the inquiries that are undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee are done off the back of reports from the Auditor-General. I think it is important that that be recognised&mdash;that we see a very important and continuing role for the Public Accounts Committee to continually review the Auditor-General's reports. When different agencies and departments have had their activities looked at by the Auditor-General's staff&mdash;whether it be performance audits or otherwise&mdash;they should be aware that those Auditor-General's reports are going to be scrutinised by a committee of the parliament. I think that in itself goes to some of the points that the chairman, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), made with regard to report 340. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on just a couple of areas in the annual report. As part of preparing this annual report we had the opportunity during the year to do an advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and, most importantly, the Auditor-General Bill. These bills flowed out of an earlier report that was done by a previous public accounts committee. There were recommendations with regard to the position of the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament, the make-up of the audit committee and that function being taken by the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those recommendations are still being kicked around in the Senate. I would certainly like to see that resolved as per the recommendations that were made by the Public Accounts Committee. Bear in mind that, apart from one very early report, the report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax: a report on an inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office</EMPHASIS>, none of the reports that have been tabled and printed by the Public Accounts Committee has contained a dissenting report. In relation to those bills that were referred to the committee by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), we made a number of recommendations and certainly hope those points of dispute get resolved in the Senate for the betterment of the Commonwealth, as it were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the major inquiry that was undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee during the life of the 37th parliament ended in report 336, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. That was an inquiry into commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector with a particular focus on the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was. I suppose with the advantage of hindsight we realise we may have been able to extend that inquiry and add to it another element, privatisation, which would have made it certainly very interesting. As I say, the inquiry was conducted at a time when the government was making, on an ongoing basis, some very important decisions about public assets in Australia. It gave the members on the committee a great insight into the focus for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the work in progress may be wound up by the end of the 37th parliament or it may have to be carried over to the 38th parliament. A couple of very important inquiries are being undertaken at the moment. The first one is the inquiry into accrual reporting and accounting by Commonwealth agencies. It is incredibly important to the future of the Commonwealth, how our agencies conduct their financial affairs and how they report their financial affairs in a far more transparent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman, in his address, gave a reasonable amount of praise to the Department of Finance in a number of areas. My personal view in this particular area is that the Department of Finance could be taking a much quicker and more aggressive approach to the implementation of accrual accounting, reporting and budgeting. Until such time as this gets implemented in the Commonwealth&mdash;the states are leading us in this regard&mdash;we will not be able to establish properly transparent accounting practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other inquiries that are moving towards finalisation is the inquiry into fiscal responsibility legislation and the implementation of whole of government reporting. Obviously, that is intrinsically linked to the inquiry into accrual accounting and reporting. Again, some interesting evidence with regard to fiscal responsibility legislation has been received by the committee from different non-government organisations as well as people from our own Commonwealth departments. As well, we have had evidence from a former minister for finance from New Zealand, where they have introduced fiscal responsibility legislation and balanced budget legislation&mdash;certainly an area that the Commonwealth should be looking to for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing my comments on the annual report, it is very important that the parliament and the people of Australia recognise the importance of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the work that it does. Certainly I look forward, if possible, to continuing my involvement on that committee in the 38th parliament, whether that be at the end of this year or next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of brief comments on report 340, on cash matters. That was also an interesting inquiry, precipitated by a couple of reports from the Auditor-General&mdash;Audit Report No. 22 and Audit Report No. 10. We had the opportunity of getting a briefing from the newly appointed Auditor-General, who was a senior officer with the Department of Finance. He flagged to the committee the importance of improving the Commonwealth's cash management procedures in a number of areas. So the committee undertook this inquiry, and it certainly has uncovered some areas of deficiency where there is room for great improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman and previous speaker, the member for Oxley, highlighted to the House, a lot of the things we uncovered that were not being done happen as a matter of course in private enterprise. In a private corporation, their treasury cannot afford not to have control of inflows and outflows. They have to have a daily finger on the pulse in relation to what money is coming in and what money is going out, what the interest rates are and what the overdraft interest is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a bit of a gap, as far as communication is concerned, between the key departments&mdash;Finance and Treasury&mdash;in this regard. There is certainly room for improvement in that area. In relation to the main revenue collector for the Commonwealth, the Australian Taxation Office, there is room for improvement in the procedures that are implemented by the tax office&mdash;the way they collect the revenue for the Commonwealth and the way they bank it. So this report is very important in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the chairman in his speech referred to specific purpose payments to the states. We are still in the process of finalising an inquiry into Commonwealth-state agreements. It might just highlight the fact that maybe the state bureaucrats&mdash;in the way they handle and manage the cash being paid by way of specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth to the states&mdash;are a bit smarter than ours, because they get the interest and the Commonwealth does not. As the chairman highlighted, how that money is paid over is another area we should certainly be looking at in that report&mdash;whether it is in a lump sum going to the states and then they spend it over the ensuing 12 months or it is just paid through on a needs basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to reinforce the recommendations in report 340, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cash matters: Cash management in the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>, that there is a lot of room for improvement. It was indicated to us in evidence in the inquiry that there is the possibility of savings in the Commonwealth of $300 million by better cash management practices. People out there in voter land probably think that this is an insignificant matter, but it is not insignificant. Three hundred million dollars worth of taxpayers' money could be much better spent in some other area of greater need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report to the House, as well as the annual report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Certainly I would like to recognise the work that has been done over the last couple of years, and particularly with these reports, by Grant Harrison and the secretariat of the Public Accounts Committee. They in no small way put up with the members of the Public Accounts Committee and their strange habits, particularly in trying to organise meetings all over Australia and making sure there are quorums when we are always tearing back to our electorates. They have done it well and I commend Grant and his team. We have made some significant progress as far as the titles of our reports are concerned. The next stage is to do something about the colours of these reports. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to make a contribution to the consideration of both the annual report of the work of the committee over the last financial year and report No. 340 which deals with cash management in the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I must emphasise the importance of the Public Accounts Committee not only to the parliament but, I believe, to the whole of the national community. To a very large extent I suppose we have a financial watchdog responsibility. As part of that particular responsibility, the Public Accounts Committee from time to time undertakes various reports into the way in which the public sector government agency accounts are held and the way in which the government generally conducts its financial affairs in the interests of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, though, that it took 13 years before the first Commonwealth parliament established the first joint committee of public accounts. It was established in 1913. It is also interesting that in 1931, during the trough of the Depression when the pressure on governments in relation to financial issues would have been so much greater and more intense and when one would imagine that the need for a public accounts committee would have been so much greater, as an economy measure the old public accounts committee then was disbanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This current Public Accounts Committee stems from legislation which was enacted in 1951 and it is particularly significant that it is a statutory committee; it is a committee required by statute to be established. Short of withdrawing that legislation, there is no way in which any government can avoid appointing a public accounts committee&mdash;a joint committee consisting of members of this House and of senators and a bipartisan committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I pay credit to all of the members of the Public Accounts Committee. As the chairman confirmed, and as the chairman encourages, the committee operates in a bipartisan way, as it should. The responsibilities of political parties in government to the national community, let alone their direct responsibilities to the parliament, should insist that they collectively give their attention and concern to the effective conduct of the financial affairs&mdash;the recording, accounting and reporting of all of the financial affairs&mdash;of governments, and they have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay special tribute to the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley. Les Scott has an extensive background in banking and, of course, it is that expertise and experience that has made it possible for him to be such an effective chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. But, without seeking to embarrass my friend and colleague, I must say that it is very much part of the personality of Les Scott that he has been able, with the great support he and all of us have had from the secretariat, to ensure that the Public Accounts Committee works so effectively. As you and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, when people from different political parties get together we are not unlikely to see clashes and tension and to anticipate and see difficulties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of my friends on the opposition side interjects; yes, of course, among the tories themselves. We understand how very difficult sometimes tories can make our public responsibilities, our pursuit and fulfilment of those public responsibilities. But, as a result of the chairmanship of the member for Oxley, we have been able to work, I believe, very well together. That was confirmed by the comments made by a member of the National Party of Australia who preceded me in this debate, the New South Wales member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who is also a member of the Public Accounts Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am at this point, I want to pay a very special tribute and give a very special credit to what I believe is one of the most effective, dedicated, competent and hardworking secretariats. It is under the leadership of Grant Harrison. Grant, together with the chairman, has the responsibility of coordinating the inquiry program and making sure that it all slots together and that the resources available&mdash;both within the secretariat and among the members and senators on the committee&mdash;are most effectively utilised. Grant has done that very well indeed. He is the secretary, the coordinator, of a very good team of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wayne Harrison is here as well. He was the inquiry manager of report 340 which, as I indicated, together with the annual report, we are in the process of considering now. Mr Wayne Harrison was seconded from the Department of Administrative Services from May of this year. Mr Wayne Harrison was not only the inquiry manager for report 340 but also a participant in the Commonwealth government's executive development scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have in the advisers' box at present Dr John Carter and Ms Laraine Brennan, representing their colleagues in the secretariat. I am pleased that these representatives of the secretariat are here. As I said, they represent a good team. I support absolutely the comments that were made by the chairman in connection with the extent to which we depend upon them. They are always very gracious about it. They sometimes credit us for more than we have actually been responsible for. They do that very graciously because, in the end, we are the ones who have to carry the can; we are the ones who are finally responsible for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that, in a sense, Grant and his colleagues are responsible too. Their professional approach to the special responsibilities that they have ensures that they want to do the best they can, and they do that&mdash;not only on behalf of the committee but also on behalf of the parliament, the government and the community. They are charged with very special responsibilities and they discharge those responsibilities, I believe, admirably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention another matter while we are dealing with the annual report. It would not be possible to complete the program of work, which is so very well reflected in that annual report, if it were not for the witnesses who, often at very great difficulty to themselves, make themselves, their time and their talents available to the committee. I refer not only to individuals but also to the organisations which so fulsomely cooperate with the Public Accounts Committee and make it possible for some of their personnel to appear before the committee. That includes organisations in the private sector and governments at state, territory and local level. Without those witnesses, it would not be possible for the inquiries to be properly conducted. As you would know from the type of committee work that you are involved in, Mr Deputy Speaker, the types of submissions that we get contribute greatly to our inquiries into those particular questions. It has also been a very successful exercise to have observers from the Australian National Audit Office and from the Department of Finance sitting in on many of those hearings, particularly when we are taking evidence and giving consideration to the development of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report refers to all the matters that were reported on during the last financial year. It includes report 331 through to report 337. There are any number of things that I would like to say about some of them, but let me refer to the first report&mdash;report 331. That was an advisory report on the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994, and the Auditor-General Bill 1994. We also accommodated within that inquiry a reference which we had earlier undertaken to consider the establishment of an audit committee of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That legislation itself was designed to upgrade and update the legislative provisions</PARA>
<PARA>which had previously existed in order to deal with all of those types of national government participation and involvement. To a very large extent, the original legislation had been designed and implemented in a period where the complexity and extent of national government involvement in economic activities was nowhere near what it is at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was an excellent inquiry. Not only did I feel it was fruitful for the committee to undertake that but, like so many of the other inquiries we were involved in, I personally enjoyed participating in the development of a report which, clearly, was of significant value to the government in determining its final attitude and position on some of that legislation. Because this committee is a joint one&mdash;a bipartisan, cross-party committee&mdash;it was possible for those procedures to allow a direct input into government legislation by the parliament. That was not just by the government, not just by caucus committees, not just by the caucus itself and not just by the cabinet, but by the parliament. I think that gives a very special dimension to the nature and the quality, the purposes and the value, of committees of the kind we are referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, as the report indicates as well, a number of inquiries under way. I will very briefly refer to them. The first I mention is the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. That is of enormous importance in intergovernment relations, in the development of state based programs and in the capacity for the federal government to have some type of input, not only in determining priorities but also participating in the funding of many of those programs, which are so often administered at state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second inquiry I mention is that of accrual reporting by Commonwealth agencies. As was indicated, I think by the previous speaker, that inquiry is being conducted and pursued in relation also to the question of the appropriateness of fiscal responsibility legislation and the implementation of whole-of-government reporting by the Commonwealth&mdash;with those two inquiries as well. The report of the inquiry into cash management in Commonwealth agencies, one of the inquiries active at 30 June this year, is now subject to the tabling motion of the chairman today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with that as well, I make brief mention of a matter which the chairman also alluded to: the way in which these committees are conducted. Members of the Public Accounts Committee were in Parliament House at 8.30 this morning. That is not unusual. I think most members are in this building at 8.30 in the morning. They never leave until some time after 8 o'clock of an evening. That used to be 11 o'clock, as you know. We are now saner and more sensible. We now work more sensible hours. We do not stay here until the middle of the night&mdash;nor should we. But members of the Public Accounts Committee were here at 8.30 this morning. The particular reason for that was an audio hook-up with officials from the United States. It was 6.30 p.m. in the United States. It was gracious and kind of those officials in the United States to make themselves available to participate in that audio hook-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We spoke with a Dr Paul Van de Water. He is assistant director for budget analysis at the Congressional Budget Office in Washington. There was also a Dr Ron Snell, who is the director of the economic and fiscal division of the National Conference of State Legislatures. I think&mdash;the chairman will assist me&mdash;he was from Denver, Colorado. Dr Van de Water was in Washington. We were here in Canberra, in one of our committee rooms, and we had an audio hook-up which lasted for an hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were able to directly question the witnesses about their experiences in relation to fiscal responsibility legislation, accrual accounting and whole of government reporting. They indicated to us that the national government of the United States still operates its accounts on a cash basis. We are moving towards an accrual basis. At that stage Dr Snell, representing the state legislatures, interjected to say that the states are moving more quickly towards accrual accounting which, to a very large extent, reflects or mirrors what is happening here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the advantage of that hook-up we had an opportunity to discuss directly, with people in the largest economy in the world, some of the particular issues with which we are confronted at present. I am sure that the chairman&mdash;he nods in agreement&mdash;confirms the value of this morning's hook-up. The secretariat also was there, listening in, participating, advising and assisting. Of course, all of the people responsible for the technical side of the hook-up were there. It was quite a remarkable achievement to have a network of communication between one person in Denver, one person in Washington, the members of the Public Accounts Committee and its secretariat. Also, there were three representatives from&mdash;I ask the chairman to confirm this&mdash;the United States Information Service. </PARA>

The chairman referred to the fact that some time back the Procedure Committee, of which I am chair, had an inquiry into the use of new technology for the purpose of committee reporting and inquiring. This was the first occasion on which I personally had the opportunity of participating in an arrangement of this kind. The possibilities are very significant. I sometimes&mdash;very frequently, let me say&mdash;get left behind by the advances in technology. It is good to be brought up to date, as I felt I was this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the committee having been established initially back in 1913, having been disbanded in 1931 and coming back in 1951. Just as an example of the volume of work undertaken by that committee, during the first 18 years of the first Joint Committee of Public Accounts there were 53 reports produced. That means that, on average, there were three reports per year. From 1951&mdash;I indicate that was the year of the legislation which established the series of public accounts committees which followed&mdash;until 1995, the current year, there have been 337. Now we have this one to which we are referring today&mdash;No. 340. During those years, 337 or 340 reports were produced over a period of 44 years. That represents almost eight reports per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to maximise the benefit of resources available to us, it is necessary from time to time for the Public Accounts Committee to establish sectional committees to deal with specific inquiries. It is always open to other members of the committee to involve themselves in those inquiries of which they may not be a member to the extent that they would wish. That gives plenty of opportunity for members to be involved in the work of the committee as widely as they would wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes I have left I will also refer to this other report: report No. 340 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cash management in the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>. I think the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who spoke before me, said it was possible that people may consider members of parliament giving their attention to the question of cash management as a bit of a waste of time&mdash;perhaps a little bit of a luxury. Perhaps we should be doing other things with our time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He emphasised the fact that a more effective cash management set of procedures within the national public sector could save the national taxpayers $300 million. That is a lot of bread on the table for my constituents. I would prefer that money back in their pockets than down here in Canberra helping to pay interest on public sector debt which arises at least in part from less than effective management. I am not knocking the Department of Finance or any of the agencies responsible for it. It is important for the parliament, for the government, to ensure that we put into place appropriate arrangements, procedures and structures to ensure that cash management is undertaken properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise that the $300 million of possible saving is a $300 million interest payment towards a total interest bill for the Commonwealth government sector debt of $10 billion a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member of the opposition says, `Shame!' He does not really mean that. In his more guarded moments he knows that, with a total budget of the Commonwealth government each year of $110 billion for national development and other purposes&mdash;there is an obligation on the part of Commonwealth governments to properly manage the financial affairs of the Commonwealth&mdash;an interest payment on national government debt is to be expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is not to be expected is that tucked away within that $10 billion is $300 million with which we can effect savings, and we can do it by more effective cash management. The Department of Finance, together with all of the government agencies, is in the process of improving its cash management procedures and processes&mdash;putting into place structures that ensure cash management is properly undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the revenue side, it was brought home to us very forcefully that, at the peak of revenue receipts by the Commonwealth government and its agencies, $1 billion a day&mdash;$1,000 million&mdash;can be received. If those cash receipts&mdash;of course they are effected through banking arrangements&mdash;are not managed properly, then the cost of managing them is greater and the possible benefit to the Commonwealth of holding them is less. For that reason, we need to give consideration, as the sectional committee of the Public Accounts Committee did, to that particular question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the expenditure side, there is a need for all of those government agencies to protect the Commonwealth's financial interest. I emphasise that I do not mean any of those agencies should delay payments to creditors simply to hold the money and get some benefit for the Commonwealth. I do not mean that. The Commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure that its accounts, its debts, are paid and paid promptly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time concern has been expressed by members from both sides of the parliament about particular instances which have been brought to their attention when that has not always happened. We have had private business people out in the community who have been waiting inordinately long for the payment of their accounts. That should not happen. I am not suggesting for a moment anything of that kind when I say that on the expenditure side there is a need to protect the Commonwealth's financial interests. What I mean is that government agencies should ensure that the whole process is conducted properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman indicated, special purpose payments that we make available to the states represent a transfer of funds from the Commonwealth government, which raises the taxes, to the states to help fund state programs or to encourage or require the states to modify perhaps their own state based programs to accommodate, quite correctly, priorities of the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If&mdash;and it has happened unquestionably: the sectional committee found this to be so&mdash;those special purpose payments are made to the states before the states actually need to spend the money, it means the money is not in our accounts earning interest for national taxpayers. It is in the accounts of the states earning interest for them and representing in effect a hidden subsidy. The states of course welcome that. Why would they not? But it is not something I believe the Commonwealth government should be doing. The Commonwealth government should be protecting its own accounts, protecting its own revenue, protecting its national taxpayers. That was one of the things referred to in the inquiry and the report into cash management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat some of the comments that were made by the chairman in connection with the recommendations of the committee. He said that one of the primary recommendations from that committee in connection with the more effective management of cash by the Commonwealth was that there should be established a series of cash forecasting benchmarks based on national and international best practice in both the public and private sectors&mdash;that is, at the Commonwealth government level, in the whole process of managing cash receipts and meeting expenditures, we should be adopting the best practice that exists. When we talk about responsible government, to a large extent that is what it is all about. We have a responsibility to the national community and national taxpayers to manage their money, to manage their cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman also emphasised that another very important recommendation contained in the report was that the Department of Finance play a more prominent role in providing guidance for line agencies&mdash;all of those government departments and all the sectors of those government departments&mdash;in the monitoring, analysis and reporting of cash management. That is the second of what I consider to be two primary recommendations of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on the note on which I opened in indicating my own personal appreciation of those people on both sides of the parliament and from both chambers of the parliament with whom we all work in the Public Accounts Committee for the commitment, the dedication and the effort that they bring to that work. It is of national importance. They fulfil it well and they fulfil it under the leadership, the management and the chairmanship of Les Scott, the member for Oxley in Queensland. As I said, he is a man who has brought all the experience from banking that he had been able to accumulate before entering this parliament. He is the sort of fellow that parliaments need. He is the sort of fellow that we appreciate and welcome on this side. I am glad that his commitment is to the government, to the Labor Party and to the labour movement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Charlton made some interesting historical observations which I would like to allude to briefly. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts was one of the earliest statutory committees of the parliament. Interestingly enough, during the Depression it was wiped out as a cost saving measure. Subsequently it was reinstituted by Professor Bland and has had a substantial record of achievement over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the honour to chair the committee from 1975 through to 1983. On the question of the number of reports that we tabled in that period, I think there were 130.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that part of the ongoing program of the committee will be the biennial federal-state Public Accounts Committee conferences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall distinctly at our very first meeting in Sydney that the then Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Renshaw, actually said on the record, `We don't need a public accounts committee because our Treasury does the most wonderful work possible.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has just been pointed out by the member for Charlton, through investigations into the cash management of the Commonwealth&mdash;the subject of the 340th report tabled here today&mdash;it is perfectly obvious that the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the states needs to be constantly under review. I believe that the Public Accounts Committee is the place in which to do that. </PARA>

It was first put in place back in about 1903, at a time when a substantial proportion of the business of the House was done by private members. In the much more informal setting that existed then, party allegiances were very fluid, government majorities were virtually non-existent, and a considerable amount of government legislation was handled through private members' processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time ministers were not the only ones accountable in government. Clearly, when bills took months to go through parliament, when issues of the day in relation to those bills changed it was important to have the capacity to get up in the chamber and question a member of the parliament about what they had in mind with a bill that was before the House, which was supported by the government and which was of vital significance to the nation with a complex set of clauses in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation has disappeared and, as it has done so, so has the use of standing order 143. When I first came to this place the only occasion I can recollect its being used was when the then member for Lilley had a private member's bill before the House and the then Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, stood up and asked her a question about it. The question was permitted but it went only to the issue of the timing of the introduction of that bill, not to a discussion of its content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In my memory this particular clause never has been used to question not a bill before the House but a motion moved by a member of parliament in private member's time. Clearly, it is a situation where a motion has been questioned. On this particular occasion it was a question to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), but it is then quite clearly open to members of parliament on a contemporary interpretation of the standing order to spend the entirety of question time standing up and asking each other questions about their various motions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. So the use of the standing order essentially to question bills has now gone well beyond that. The potential for it to go further than that is now enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare this situation with the situation in 1903. We now have in place committees&mdash;which in those days they did not have in parliament. There is now a vast array of committee chairmen and deputy chairmen around the House, all usually with business before the House&mdash;matters that have been referred to them by the House, matters that they themselves are referring back to the House and reports that they are producing. On contemporary interpretations of standing order 143, they are all capable of being questioned in the House on the matters that are before them. We have also instituted a new institution of parliamentary secretaries. Actually, that is not so new. They did exist for a very brief period when members of the Liberal and National parties were in office. Clearly, under interpretations of standing order 143 they are now capable of being questioned as to their activities as parliamentary secretaries in so far as they might well relate to affairs in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So well and truly the genie is out of the bottle on this issue. The tradition of question time is that of being a point in time where the government is held to accountability. Questions asked of ministers could be rendered in these circumstances a complete farce. It is also obvious that, in the interpretation of standing order 143 on the last two occasions that it has been used, it was very restrictive. It goes simply to a question of the narrow element of it in terms of timing and procedure. If you look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, you would think that the area was very narrow indeed. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, if the answer to such a question would require the Member to anticipate what he or she might say in the second reading speech&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">clearly they do not actually anticipate questions going on notices of motion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the question is anticipating debate and is therefore out of order.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume a similar interpretation might have applied to a question that refers not to a bill but to a notice of motion before the House. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A question asking when the bill will be introduced, whether the bill has been drafted, or whether the questioner could see a copy of the bill would be in order. A question of a wider scope has been allowed to a Member in charge of a bill actually before the House. For example, a Member who had already made his second reading speech was permitted to explain the meaning of a clause of his bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, however, the way in which that has been utilised, that quite narrow set of interpretations over the last few months has been broadened out quite considerably, and a deal more is permitted in discussion of it. In those circumstances, we could obviously have the ludicrous situation applying of everybody getting up and asking each other questions in this place. </PARA>

I have indicated to him that I intend to write to the Procedure Committee for them to review the application of standing order 143 in the light of the changed circumstances&mdash;with the existence now of committee chairmen; with the existence now of parliamentary secretaries; with the precedents that have been set on the last couple of occasions which have gone well beyond a request for a simple explanation of a particular clause into a capacity for, effectively, a wholesale debate on the intention of the bill; given what was not anticipated though is permitted, and that is you go simply beyond discussing a bill but discussing a notice of motion before the House. The standing order should also be looked at it in the light of whether that constitutes an appropriate aspect of question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also look at whether or not, if it is the genuine desire of members that they have an opportunity to question each other on matters before the House, a question time for members might not be made available. That would be a very useful thing for the committee to look at. If members have a desire for the opportunity to question each other on private legislation that they have put before the House, or on notices of motion that they have put before the House, then the Procedure Committee could well look at that and we could look at the possibility of setting aside 45 minutes a week for precisely that sort of activity. It is not the intention of the government to eliminate this standing order. It is the intention of the government to modernise it so that it relates to contemporary parliamentary practice instead of 1903 parliamentary practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman will receive a letter from me shortly that will confirm what I have already discussed with him verbally on this matter and should provide an opportunity for all members of parliament to have an input, including an input into the notion of whether or not there ought to be a members' question time in the course of a parliamentary week. In recent times we have dramatically expanded the capacity of private members to initiate activity in this chamber. The opportunity was at one stage given on Thursdays but it is now given on Mondays. I do not see any problem with expanding the opportunity if we can work out some way of doing it sensibly&mdash;with a 45-minute period for members to ask questions, for example, if that is what is desired. That is something that the committee ought to take a look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim this standing order is being used in ways in which it has certainly not been used in the living memory of any member of this chamber and in a way which has probably not been used at any time since its application in 1903. It is important that question time maintain its essential character as a time related to holding the government accountable. The fact that the opposition is unsuccessful in holding the government accountable does not diminish the theory of what the exercise is supposed to be but merely the opposition's capacities in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be said for one minute that the opposition is not being well treated in interpretations of what is in order in the asking of questions these days. It has been treated very generously by successive speakers since we have been in office&mdash;on what, if you look through standing orders on questions at question time, is a very restrictive set of rules about the ways in which questions may be asked. They have been very broadly expanded, effectively, in interpretation, over the last seven or eight years or so, very much to the advantage of the opposition. Therefore, the fact that the opposition finds it difficult to hold us accountable, with all those added advantages, speaks more of them than it does of us. </PARA>

As an Independent member of the House, I would certainly oppose any further restrictions on the method in which question time is conducted. I was interested in the comments of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). Having looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> in relation to standing order 143, the Speaker of this place has in fact been correctly interpreting the questions asked on two occasions by my colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), using standing order 143.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as the Leader of the House well knows, if one were to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> one would know that the interpretation of standing order 143 has been traditionally of the most narrow scope possible. As the Leader of the House would well know, from his experience as a longstanding member of this place, the narrow scope of standing order 143 was nonetheless wide enough to allow the two questions by the member for Warringah to the Leader of the Opposition, seeking responses in relation to motions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in his name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously been a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure&mdash;a very important committee of this House. Having participated in the last but one report, which gave rise to the changes to question time in which we saw the introduction of rosters for ministers, I have to express some very serious concerns about this suspension of standing order 143 until the Procedure Committee has reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is rather like putting the horse before the cart. Why does the government not wait until the Procedure Committee has had an opportunity to examine this proposal before it takes what is in fact presumptory action, and suspend what is, and will hopefully remain in the future, a perfectly reasonable and usable form of this House, to inquire of members about the progress or stewardship of their particular motions or private members' bills on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an Independent member, I believe this proposal by the Leader of the House on behalf of the government places a further restriction on the opportunity for members to properly question not only ministers of the government but also those responsible for introducing private members' bills or motions on to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I notice that the chairman of the Procedure Committee, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is present. He is a man who, I believe, has acted in a fair way in his stewardship of that committee. I can only urge him to use whatever influence he has, as a former minister in the Hawke government, to try to get the government to change what is basically a further restriction on question time that is being proposed by way of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing in essence the government responding in a ham-fisted way to a particular form of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was sitting behind you thinking we were referring to item No. 10 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> when in fact it was No. 11. The fact that the Prime Minister was on the wrong foot is obviously a matter for him to resolve and of course a matter for you and him to resolve jointly in relation to your government's strategy. Let us not use that particular failure on Monday as a reason for then ham-fistedly ironing out one of the most important opportunities, albeit on a narrow basis, for members to ask pertinent questions of those who have the stewardship of private members' bills or motions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said to us that it has extended opportunities for private members to participate in debates and to introduce matters into the House. But, in real terms, the government is encroaching more and more upon the sovereignty of parliament and of course is using executive power to basically crush whatever opportunity we have to express in this place the will of our constituents. In the end, it is our constituents' interests that are being crushed here. Constituents may want to know about matters contained in a private member's bill or a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> currently, and we are now prevented from dealing with them. We are prevented from asking questions. </PARA>

It is just that the government fears that that could be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then of course the Leader of the House went on some historical journey to say that when the standing order was established in 1903 it was a much different parliament: it was a much more informal setting; government majorities were more shaky; bills took months and months; the party system was not so rigid; and there was a greater number of Independents. That situation ended 55 or 60 years ago. That situation did not continue on past the early 1930s. So the justification now for overturning this right of members to question other members besides ministers on the basis that it is outdated is a complete nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The setting that the minister paints ended more than 60 years ago; but consecutive parliaments, and governments for that matter, have retained the need for standing order 143.

How does that justify the government's now truncating of members' individual rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's not put up with this phoney suspension of 143. To all intents and purposes you have abolished it until the next election, and there is the key to it. You are referring off to the Procedure Committee a review. You hold out the promise of a 45-minutes-a-week question time for members; but, of course, not before the next election. That is the key to this whole thing. The fact is that the government lives in fear of the Leader of the Opposition and will even go to the extent of abolishing a standing order that has existed since 1903 to protect itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House claimed that the genie was out of the bottle. The genie is out of the bottle simply because the opposition used standing order 143 on but two occasions to question the Leader of the Opposition during question time.

If it becomes a farce, we will be the first to join with the government in finding a way, for the good of the parliament, to stop any exploitation of 143. But it is not a farce; it is simply that you are worried we will use standing order 143 between now and the next election. Remember, after today there are but two more sitting weeks to question the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the public would want to know why standing order 143 is being abolished simply because the opposition has used it on two occasions. Let me read out standing order 143. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real motive, of course, in suspending standing order 143 is that the government has been embarrassed by the Leader of the Opposition's exposure during question time of, firstly, its incompetence and hypocrisy over the third runway issue and, secondly, its blatant disregard of proper ministerial standards of conduct. They are the two issues which members of the opposition, more particularly the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), have asked the Leader of the Opposition to address.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Fraser years, an average of 77 ministerial statements were made per year. Under Labor that figure has dropped to 30. Why should they bother with ministerial statements, thereby giving the minister's opposite number a platform on which to respond, when they can use question time for these long monologues that often go over 10 minutes? As a result, this parliament is reduced to the farce that the Leader of the House makes out that standing order 143 will lead to. Forget about it ever leading to a farce; you have turned the workings of the parliament into a complete farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has debased parliamentary standards through his abuse of procedures and his vile and undignified language.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion seeks to stifle a legitimate recourse for the opposition to expose incompetence and hypocrisy by the government.

Who would have called him in and said, `Stop any more questions from the member for Warringah and/or anyone else from the opposition to the Leader of the Opposition'? It would have been the Prime Minister himself. This has his fingerprints all over it, and it is a harbinger of things to come.

I think someone else mentioned 1903, and that is possible. But, as the Leader of the House and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) quite correctly indicated, certainly during my time and his time in this place that standing order was invoked on only one occasion prior to the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was when the then Leader of the Opposition, Bill Hayden, directed a question to Mrs Elaine Darling, who was then the member for Lilley, in connection with a private member's bill that she had before the parliament. To my knowledge, it has not been otherwise used, until more recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to&mdash;nor, I assure members of the opposition, does anyone on this side of the chamber&mdash;nor any concern about members of the opposition properly exercising their rights, responsibilities and duties to their constituents, the parliament and the parliamentary institution; that is, to act as a vigorous and an effective opposition. That is how this government has acted, and it continues to operate as a vigorous and effective government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern on the part of the opposition is whether there are ample opportunities for the opposition to question and challenge the government. I draw the attention of the House and the wider community to some of the provisions which already exist. If the opposition were to manage its affairs more effectively and more efficiently, it would utilise some of these provisions which already exist more effectively and more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, in connection with legislation which passes through this parliament the opposition has the opportunity to oppose it, to amend it, to seek to reject it, to challenge it and to take it out into the community. One of the great benefits of the types of circumstances we enjoy in Australia is that we live in a vigorous democracy. I would hope everyone in this parliament and in this chamber would endorse that. So the opposition can do that as far as legislation is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition can also move for a suspension of standing orders if they wish to bring on a matter which is important to them. That provision exists within the standing orders. Why, then, has it not been used? Why does the opposition not recognise that? That is an opportunity for all of those purposes for which, I believe, standing order 143 has started to be misused. Let us all be perfectly clear about it: standing order 143 was never intended to be used in the way in which it is being used at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the government would be seeking to suspend the operation of standing order 143. Let me make this point as clearly and as vigorously as I can: the government has the power to abandon that standing order forthwith. I appreciate the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister quite properly came to me, as chairman of the Procedure Committee, and indicated that it was the intention of the government to suspend this standing order and to make a reference to the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the assurance of the Deputy Prime Minister that that reference will be wide. It will not in any way attempt to restrict the Procedure Committee in dealing properly with this question, to make sure that whatever concerns may be expressed by the opposition can be adequately accommodated&mdash;in just the same way as the legitimate and proper concerns of the government. So there are those two ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the existence of the matter of public importance. Every day that this parliament sits, generally members of the opposition and, very infrequently, members of the government have an opportunity to raise a matter of public importance and have that debated. It is not just on days when the Senate is being broadcast; it is also on days when this chamber is being broadcast. So if there are any people out in the community who want to hear those issues, they can tune in and hear them directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the grievance debate. There is also private members' time when members of this parliament can get up and, in 10 minutes, take the opportunity to raise issues which are of concern to them, either individually or collectively. We also have the adjournment debate. Every night that this parliament sits, all members of the parliament have an opportunity to seek to attract the attention of the Speaker in order to get five minutes in which, again, they can raise any of the issues they want to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have questions on notice. Let me also emphasise that, as a result of recommendations by the Procedure Committee and decisions by this government, provisions to ensure that questions on notice will be answered more promptly and more adequately have been put into place. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, if any members of this parliament genuinely want to seek information, genuinely want to challenge ministers and genuinely want to challenge the government, they also have the opportunity to do that through questions on notice which go into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. That <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> is available for the observation of the media, and for the observation of anyone who wants access to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a vigorous democracy with a well-informed public&mdash;a very well-informed public, an alert public, an astute public, a receptive public. We have a very vigorous media, the fourth estate, in Australia. There are no restrictions on it, apart from the normal restrictions of libel and slander, to which the editorial columns and articles of every issue of every newspaper, magazine and journal in Australia will attest. We have a vigorous democracy, supported strongly by the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have doorstops. Most of us were probably doorstopped this morning, with the media coming out and seeking our responses. Members of parliament have an opportunity then to respond publicly to those issues. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) wants to call a media conference, depending upon the issue and the media's time and responsiveness, at any time during the day he can attract around to any committee room members of the media. He will then have an opportunity to say anything that he wants to, to raise any issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me emphasise: there is no need&mdash;no need&mdash;for question time to be used in the way in which an attempt is being made to utilise it under standing order 143; that is, where there are questions being directed by members of the opposition to the Leader of the Opposition simply because he chose to establish the base for those questions by putting some motions on notice. I believe that the procedure which the Leader of the House, the Deputy Prime Minister, has adopted is perfectly proper. He has respected the forms and institutions of the House. He has referred the matter to me and indicated that it will be a suspension and not an abandonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee now will have the opportunity to examine all of the alternatives&mdash;and, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a cross-party committee. Let me say this: there are only two weeks of sitting left this year. As a result of the suspension and consideration by the committee, it should be possible for us to consider this matter and come back and have for the rest of the year&mdash;including the lead-up to the election, whenever that might be next year, which time is so critical to the opposition&mdash;a new standing order in place which will make it possible then for us more effectively to achieve the objectives that were originally intended under standing order 143 but which, quite clearly, at the present time are not being achieved by it. </PARA>

I have said in this place many times that it seems to me, in recent years, this House is losing not only its character but also its ability to deal with the issues with which it should deal. It is becoming simply a mechanism for government to ramrod its legislation and its agenda through a formal procedure in order to get it off to the Senate and try to convince senators to pass its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not care about members participating in the democratic process. The House is no longer a House of Representatives; it is a House of government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing this opportunity is truly draconian. I wish the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) had been in this House in 1991. I had before the House at the time a private member's bill which dealt with the Industrial Relations Act. That bill was intended to remove section 299(1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act, which was in fact a punitive section which said, in effect, you cannot say anything derogatory about the Industrial Relations Commission or a member of the commission or you pay a fine or you go to gaol or both. </PARA>

The fact is that use of standing order 143 by a member, the member for Warringah or any other member, to ask me a question about that issue could have well helped put that issue on the national agenda and focused attention on the government and its failure to properly use the mores of the House to proceed with business. </PARA>

What it is all about is the fact that use of standing order 143 on two occasions in recent times has allowed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to stand on his feet at this dispatch box in front of this microphone and speak to this parliament and speak to the people of this nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On Tuesday, United Nations Day, I spoke to a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the charter of the United Nations about the importance of the United Nations to Australia and our role in it. I also spoke about a major step in Australia's disarmament policies. I believe the issues raised are relevant to all the honourable members who sit in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, visited Australia in April to take part in a conference on global cultural diversity, he said to me that he judged countries not so much by their size and GDP, which one would tend to think was the normal yardstick of his measure, but rather by their ideas and their commitment and the impact and the difference that they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the Secretary-General's measure, Australia has made a disproportionately large contribution to the work of the United Nations. This has come in the work done by men and women like Dr Evatt and Jessie Street during the creation of the body, through the work over the years of Australian peacekeepers who have served with great courage and distinction in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean, through our aid and refugee workers, our diplomats working on disarmament, our health experts dealing with smallpox or AIDS, our contribution to the spread of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And it has come, particularly in recent years in the area of arms control and disarmament where we have played an important role in areas like the creation of the Treaty of Rarotonga, support for the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the agreement to ban chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else, the people who drafted the charter of the United Nations 50 years ago, who had just experienced a global conflict&mdash;the most destructive in all of human history&mdash;were motivated by the desire to rid the world of the scourge of war. But their hopes were almost immediately crushed with the coming of the Cold War. For the first time, the international community had to contemplate the possibility that another world war would destroy our civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the debate and anger over the past months about the French government's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific, there is one point which consistently recurs in our thinking about this issue. I have made that point publicly. It is that, however strong our opposition to them, those tests at Mururoa, and China's continued testing, are not themselves the core of the problem. They are instead a symptom of the problem&mdash;the deeper and more troubling problem, of course, being the problems of nuclear weapons in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have seen such a huge outpouring of public concern about the French tests, not only in this region where they are being held but also in Europe and Japan and elsewhere, has been a feeling that we have been cheated&mdash;robbed of the chance of a world free of nuclear weapons. With the end of the Cold War, we all breathed more easily. We allowed ourselves to think that the nuclear threat, the nightmare of two generations, had finally passed. The thought of nuclear weapons and nuclear war faded from our minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality has not faded. Fifty thousand nuclear warheads remain in the arsenals of the five declared nuclear powers. And it is no less real and frightening that others&mdash;not just the so-called threshold states of India, Pakistan and Israel but others like Iraq&mdash;wait and work to acquire nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French decision to resume testing&mdash;announced within weeks of the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty&mdash;was an outrage and a folly. It has produced an entirely understandable wave of anger around the world. But we may yet be able to derive something positive from it because it has jolted us back to the reality of nuclear weapons in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now feel a growing certainty that some great good might yet be got out of the present bitterness if we make this the moment to take on the challenge of nuclear weapons. I believe we can turn the global outrage at French and Chinese testing into something broader and more ambitious&mdash;I mean the creation of a world totally free of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has often been talked about in the past, of course. It is a goal which has been forcefully articulated by Professor Joseph Rotblat, who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize. It has long been an aim of Australian policy. However, to most people, including me, it has always seemed an unachievable ambition, at least in our own lifetimes. The strategic uncertainties and deep political suspicions of the Cold War would surely have made this goal impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that world has now changed. We still have conflict, of course. We still have competing national interests. But the strategic framework in which nations operate has changed profoundly and I believe it is now possible to contemplate getting a concrete program to achieve a nuclear weapons free world because the truth is that the sort of world we now have, with nuclear powers committed to reducing their arsenals and unlikely to use their weapons offensively, will not continue forever. We can be certain of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we take action now, the nuclear competition that characterised most of the second half of this century will very likely return&mdash;and probably in a much more unstable and multipolar form. The world must extricate itself from the circular argument that we need nuclear weapons because we have nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nuclear powers cannot be excluded from this: they must understand that the most likely threats to their own security lie in the proliferation of the very weapons that they hold. This is a point we have made often about the French tests and the way they cut across the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the most important arms control treaty ever negotiated within the UN system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the former French President Giscard d'Estaing made a similar point in an article in the French press on 12 October. He said that `the increase in the number of states, be they big or small, who manage to develop nuclear weapons, now constitutes for France a threat just as serious, if not more serious, than that of a strategic strike decided by one of the rare countries with nuclear weaponry'. I believe that a world free of nuclear weapons is now attainable. It can be done and it will be in the best security interests of Australia and our allies and friends if we do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we saw in the Gulf War, new technology has given weaponry an accuracy that substitutes precision for brute explosive force, and with far less risk to civilians than those from nuclear weapons. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have also seen how real is the potential for catastrophic nuclear accidents. The government believes the time has come for more determined movement towards the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no magic wand we can wave to make this happen. As with the long negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to get rid of chemical weapons, ultimate success may be decades away. And getting there involves security issues of the greatest complexity and profundity. We do not minimise the difficulties or the dangers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Success depends ultimately on having the will as well as the ambition. The chemical weapons convention has shown that where there is a will there is a way to put the genie back in the bottle. We proved it was possible to rid the world of a whole class of weapons of mass destruction. And the verification problems for a total ban on nuclear weapons should be easier to solve than those for a ban on chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key building block for a nuclear weapons free world is already in place with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, article VI of which commits the nuclear weapon states to `pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament'. But this generalised statement of principle is not nearly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need now is action to achieve the abolition of all nuclear weapons. These are the next steps the government has in mind. In our own region we want an end to nuclear testing by France and the closure of the Mururoa test site. For nearly 50 years&mdash;since the beginning of the nuclear weapons era&mdash;the Pacific has been used as a testing ground. The Americans began testing in the Pacific in 1946 and continued until 1962; the French are still testing in French Polynesia; and the Menzies coalition government approved British testing in Australia between 1952 and 1963. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, the Australian government&mdash;this Labor government&mdash;set the objective of ridding the region of testing and began its campaign to declare a South Pacific nuclear-free zone. With the announcement on 20 October by France, the United Kingdom and the United States that they would sign the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty in the first half of 1996, we can say that we are on the point of achieving our objective and ending a dark period of the region's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's deep regret, of course, is that France is not drawing the logical conclusion from its intention to sign the South Pacific nuclear-free zone protocols and ending its tests now&mdash;as we urge it to do. We also want the nuclear weapons states to support the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty, which is being presented to the current session of the General Assembly, as well as the South-East Asian nuclear weapon free zone, which is nearing completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that progress towards a nuclear weapons free world would be given a major boost through the creation of linkages between the existing or potential nuclear weapons free zones in the South Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Indian Ocean, which already cover most of the Southern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Globally, the most immediate priority has to be the conclusion of a genuinely comprehensive test ban treaty by mid-1996, followed by its early entry into force. Australia, together with Mexico and New Zealand, is presenting a resolution to the current session of the General Assembly to entrench this deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Geneva, Australia has been consulting closely with key countries on ways to expedite the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament to take advantage of this opportunity. Over the next few months, the government will be devoting substantial resources&mdash;as we did for the chemical weapons convention&mdash;to doing what we can to help bring this about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, we want to see the immediate start and early conclusion of negotiations on a convention to ban the production of fissile material for weapons purposes&mdash;the so-called `cut-off' convention. And we want to see the development of a regime requiring all states to declare and account for their present stocks of fissile material, as another necessary prelude to the elimination of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to encourage the strengthening of international safeguards, in particular by building up the International Atomic Energy Agency's ability to detect illegal undeclared nuclear facilities. We want universal membership of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, particularly by the nuclear threshold states of India, Israel and Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said earlier, Australia is determined to pursue the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. We want the nuclear weapons states to carry out their commitment to the elimination of their nuclear stockpiles by adopting a systematic process to achieve that result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next steps towards this are the adherence by the United States and Russia to the destruction timetable under START, and further nuclear reduction agreements between the United States and Russia, with the earliest possible involvement of the United Kingdom, France and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge the need, as we always have, for a system of stable deterrence to be maintained while the reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons is being achieved. All these elements constitute a program which will set norms for international behaviour, establish new international legal obligations and further develop international control mechanisms which will serve as an essential framework for the safe and secure elimination of nuclear weapons. </PARA>

In a major series of meetings in Australia, this group will be tasked to produce a report to be submitted to the next United Nations General Assembly and to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A judgment by the court that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is legal, even if only in some limited circumstances, runs the profound risk of achieving precisely the opposite of what those seeking the court's opinions want&mdash;namely, the encouragement of others who want to join the nuclear club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even a judgment that nuclear weapons use or threat is illegal&mdash;unless very carefully framed to deal with how that conclusion might be put into practical effect&mdash;would likely be ignored by the nuclear powers and as a result serve no purpose other than to weaken the standing of the court itself. </PARA>

In the public debate which has followed, the federal opposition has accused the government, and me, of mounting a political stunt. That is all there was to it. From them there was no agreement or disagreement; no debate over the comprehensive test ban treaty or the prospects for a cut-off convention; nothing about linkages between nuclear-free zones; no analysis of proliferation problems; and no advice on how the policy might be managed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister chose, in the last three or four minutes of his remarks, to call attention to some of my attitudes on foreign affairs. This Prime Minister&mdash;my Labor opponent&mdash;is the man who in 1979 said, `Who cares about Afghanistan?' So, if you start reminding people of what they have said in the past, I might remind the House that in 1979 the member for Blaxland was so unconcerned about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as to dismiss with that kind of dismissive remark the approach taken to impose sanctions against the Soviet Union because of the invasion of Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that Australia became a major signatory to the major international instrument held up by the Prime Minister in his speech as being the driving force towards the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons&mdash;in other words, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty&mdash;because of the action of the Gorton coalition government in 1970, which was 25 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There he goes. In typical Keating fashion, he runs out when there is a bit of heat. He cannot stand a little bit of heat. When I got the written text, I said to the member of my staff who handed me the Prime Minister's statement, `What is it like? How many bucketings of the opposition are there?' She said, `None.' I said, `Well, that's a change. Maybe we can have an intelligent, level-headed bipartisan debate on an issue that all Australians care about.' That is what I want to do. I was absolutely determined to come into the parliament and to give the Prime Minister credit for what was in the written statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was really no notice of that ridiculous end that he put on the statement. This man really is addicted to vitriol. He is absolutely hooked on the habit. No matter what the issue is&mdash;no matter how important the issue is&mdash;he really just cannot help himself. The idea that he could rise above some kind of political tirade, actually forebear and pass up the opportunity was really just too much for him. So not only did he add some kind of snide reference to the Menzies coalition government's agreeing to British nuclear tests in the 1950s&mdash;it would be interesting to know what the Australian Labor Party said about those tests at the time&mdash;but also he could not resist adding more at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just say very clearly and deliberately, on behalf of the opposition, that the goals of a nuclear-free world are goals with which the Liberal and National parties completely associate themselves. Despite the nattering interjections of those opposite, it has been the goal of governments representing both sides of Australian politics over the last 40 years to rid this world of nuclear weapons. The idea that Paul Keating, or anybody on the Labor side of politics, has some kind of dignified moral monopoly on the high ground on this issue is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the House of a remark that was made by Dr Keith Suter, the President of the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney. I do not think he will be given first class honours in Star Wars research while he holds that particular position. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, he says `Paul Keating expressed little interest in this issue'&mdash;a nuclear-free world&mdash;and his change of heart is a `remarkable turnaround'. That is from an acknowledged expert on peace studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that in 1984 there was a ruckus in the Labor Party about the MX missile splash-down facilities that the Hawke government had agreed to give to the United States. And there was a revolt against that from the left wing&mdash;but not from Paul Keating. I do not remember Paul Keating being arm in arm with Tom Uren in 1985 when the Labor Party withdrew permission for the Americans to have splash-down facilities in Australian territorial waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact Paul Keating urged Bob Hawke to take a very right-wing position on that particular issue. Far from being arm in arm with Tom Uren, he was arm in arm with Ronald Reagan. On that particular issue he was probably a bit closer to the truth, but that was before he was Prime Minister and before he was trying to parade his peace credentials around Australia. He could not have given a damn about South-East Asia before he became Prime Minister. He flew over it with contempt as he raced towards the shopping malls of Paris&mdash;we all know that. He could not have cared less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to all of those debates between Paul Keating and John Hewson and Tim Fischer about Asia. Hewson and Fischer have forgotten more about Asia than Keating has learnt in the whole of the time that he has been in parliament. Once again, he is a poseur when it comes to international relations. Through his behaviour in the last few minutes of that speech, he squandered an ideal opportunity for this parliament to express calm bipartisan support for something that all Australians are interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for his ridicule of the behaviour of the Reagan administration, President Reagan, be it remembered, went to the Reykjavik Summit with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986 and declared his commitment to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. It is my view&mdash;and the view of many who have studied the history of that period&mdash;that if it had not have been for the action taken by Reagan and Weinberger in the mid-1980s, you would never have had the ultimate disintegration of the Soviet Union, an event that has done more to bring about the chink of light that the Prime Minister is now talking about than any other development in foreign affairs since the end of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you understand history, do not dump on the role played by people like Reagan and Weinberger in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Far from those who supported those policies in the 1980s being proved wrong, they have in fact been proved right. The fact that there is now an opportunity, of which the Prime Minister speaks, is as much due to what they did as to anything that has been done by those who sit opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to some of the calmer things I had intended to say when I read the text. The Prime Minister is never what he seems: he comes in here in statesmanlike mode, with the tie in place, the posed dignity and the dropped voice; his followers are all behind him, and we are treated to a morally unctuous lecture, `We in the Labor Party are the only people who care that people shouldn't be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.' What a moral nerve you lot have to suggest that you are the only people in Australian politics who have any interest in the preservation of peace and stability!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said yesterday, the goal of a nuclear-free world has been shared across the political divide in Australia for about 30 years. The idea that it has only been in the last three or four days is ridiculous. All that the Prime Minister has done over the last three days is to recommit the Keating government to what has been a bipartisan constant of Australian politics for the last 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all he has done. He has not struck out and embraced any new initiative; he has not peeled the scales away from the eyes of Australians; he has not unlocked us into some new understanding.

I do not think he made any speeches about nuclear non-proliferation, any more than he made speeches about engagement with Asia. He made speeches about all sorts of other things&mdash;and that was his right&mdash;but he should not now try to rewrite history and give us moral lectures.

I am perfectly happy to accept that most of them have had that view for many years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite seem to have the idea that, somehow or other, like a repugnance towards racism, when it comes to nuclear weapons issues moral purity is something they have exclusively, just as they claim to have it in relation to other issues as well. This is a great weakness in their approach to politics. This issue of a nuclear-free world ought to be bipartisan. If the Prime Minister had not introduced that very sour, discordant, mean-spirited, characteristic note towards the end of his speech, we may have come out of this debate as a group of people with a little more dignity. We may have made a greater impact. We may have impressed younger generations of Australians a little more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great biblical injunction says that, as you sow, so shall you reap. The Prime Minister has sown discord and disharmony.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice, who is at the table, can interject as much as he likes, but the whole tone of this debate was destroyed by the Prime Minister in the last three minutes of his address. The truth of the matter is that we on this side of the House are utterly and totally committed to the goal of a nuclear-free world. For the sake of ourselves, our children and future generations, however difficult it may be to obtain, we would all like nuclear weapons to be eliminated from the face of the earth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of his speech, the Prime Minister acknowledged that, as a result of the end of the Cold War, we now live in an inherently less stable world environment so far as nuclear weapons are concerned. That is a very interesting admission. It is a little at odds with some of the things he has been saying about my foreign policy remarks over the past few weeks. However, along with the Prime Minister, I find the attitude of the French towards nuclear tests in the Pacific to be not only insensitive, but also, as the Prime Minister said, an act of complete folly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find something Augustinian in the decision of the French to sign the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty after they have completed their tests. It is very much a question of `Lord, make me pure, but not just yet.' I do not think the French commitment, in those terms and in that context, is a very impressive commitment. And I agree very much with the Prime Minister on this point, that it does not do anything to assuage the sense of hostility and the sense of rejection that is felt across party lines, across generational lines&mdash;across all lines&mdash;in Australia towards what the French have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the world has changed utterly since the end of the Cold War. Before the Cold War ended, people had a different view about many of the things that bear upon this debate now. But I think all Australians, and people all around the world, felt that the end of the Cold War offered a new hope and a new opportunity for a world that, for almost two generations, had lived under the threat of nuclear annihilation. It is a sense of outrage and indignation that the French tests have generated&mdash;not only in the Australian community but around the world&mdash;that that new dawn following the end of the Cold War might be threatened that has led to such a widespread and spontaneous protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, on behalf of the opposition I want to say that, first and most importantly, we support utterly and without reservation any reasonable measures taken by this government to achieve the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The second point I would make is that that has been a goal of successive Australian governments, of all political persuasions, for at least 25 or 30 years. It is not a sudden discovery of the Keating government. It is not a sudden discovery of this Prime Minister. It has been a goal attested to by the leaders of this country, from Sir Robert Menzies through to Paul Keating, over a very long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, with those qualifications and in that context, the opposition welcomes the statement of the Prime Minister. I think the written statement delivered to me was infinitely more appropriate for the occasion and infinitely more deserving of the almost unstinting bipartisan response that this kind of statement would have received. I have to say that it was a pity the occasion was not matched by the contribution of the leader of this country. It was an occasion to put party politics aside. It was an occasion to rise above the political point scoring which is a compulsive element of the man's character. It was an occasion that, once again, he failed to match. </PARA>

The subject of whistleblowing has been increasingly an issue on the national agenda. It is likely that the committee's report signifies the beginning of a new attitude to the general subject of whistleblowing. That state of affairs is consistent with the now well-established philosophy of this government to develop modern, responsible managerial practices in public administration which serve as a guide to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to give in principle approval to the development of whistleblower legislation that will strengthen the position of public-spirited citizens within our modern managerial framework. First, however, I will briefly outline to you several matters which are relevant to whistleblowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reports that have a direct bearing on both the protection and disclosure of information and Public Service administration&mdash;the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on the protection of confidential and third party information, and the report of the Public Service Act Review Group. These reports raise issues of direct relevance to any proposed whistleblowing scheme and it is appropriate to consider the detail of a whistleblowing scheme in the light of the recommendations contained within these reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service supported the Gibbs committee's recommendations on the protection of whistleblowers. The government considers whistleblowing legislation to be an integral part of its response to the recommendations of the Samuels commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the guidelines on official conduct of Commonwealth public servants, a revised edition of which was issued in March 1995, have been amended to explain how a disclosure of information can be made under existing laws and the protection that is currently available to whistleblowers. It should also be noted that the Financial Management and Accountability Bill will give responsibility to managers for identifying and responding to instances of maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of my statement I will present the government's detailed response to the committee's recommendations and, while that response indicates that the government's course of action on the issue of whistleblowing, I believe a short statement to explain what the government's proposed whistleblowing scheme is about is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government understands the term whistleblowing to refer to the disclosure, in the public interest, of information which indicates wrongdoing. The public interest is in the fair and independent investigation of such allegations of wrongdoing, and the protection of a whistleblower from recrimination in the course of his or her employment following his or her disclosure of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government intends to introduce into parliament legislation for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations. In the Commonwealth sphere whistleblowing is hindered by provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 prohibiting the disclosure of official information. In December 1991 the Gibbs committee, in its review of Commonwealth criminal law, made certain recommendations for the reform of the laws on the disclosure of official information. The public report of the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service also recommended the introduction of whistleblowing legislation. It will be appropriate to introduce laws on whistleblowing, both as part of the government's implementation of the Gibbs committee's recommendations and as a part of the government's response to the recommendations of the Samuels committee of inquiry into ASIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme will be based upon a two-stage process&mdash;whistleblowing disclosure within a department or agency and then to an independent agency. This process is identical to the basis of the committee's proposed scheme and parallels arrangements that have been successful in other contexts, such as police complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will apply to Commonwealth officers and contractors. It will encourage them to use internal reporting mechanisms in the first instance in the form of an officer authorised to receive whistleblowing disclosures. The legislation will also provide for the use of existing independent reporting agencies&mdash;the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the IGIS&mdash;to ensure that disclosures are received and investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government anticipates that access to the MPRA will ensure that whistleblowers who are Commonwealth officers are protected from retaliation in the course of their employment. Government contractors and their employees will receive similar protection from recrimination by Commonwealth officers through the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the IGIS, as appropriate. Consequential amendments will be made to the relevant legislation to ensure that these independent agencies have the jurisdiction and powers appropriate to ensuring that the objectives of the proposed whistleblowing scheme are achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee emphasised that potential whistleblowers need to be reassured that their disclosures will be fully and properly investigated by an appropriate independent agency that is accountable for its activities. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will be required to oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme and prepare information for inclusion in his or her annual report. The IGIS will oversee the operation of the whistleblowing scheme in the intelligence and security agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes that an authorised officer who represents the internal reporting mechanism will be required to notify the Ombudsman of receipt of the whistleblower's complaint. The Ombudsman will have certain discretionary powers which may be exercised over the authorised officer's investigation of the disclosure. The authorised officer's decision to investigate the matter, or not, or to refer the matter to the Ombudsman or IGIS for investigation, or the result of the investigation, will be communicated to the whistleblower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the whistleblower is dissatisfied with the authorised officer's decision not to investigate, or with the result of the investigation, the whistleblower can take the matter to the Ombudsman or the IGIS. The Ombudsman or IGIS will have a range of powers to investigate a whistleblower's allegations, including the power to refuse to do so. They will also have the power to refer the matter to any other appropriate agency, such as the Auditor-General or the Privacy Commissioner, to be dealt with as that agency sees fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not consider it appropriate for a whistleblower to make public disclosures, either before using the whistleblower scheme or before a final determination has been made on the allegations. Whistleblowing allegations are serious matters requiring careful investigation. The information available to a whistleblower may not be complete, nor is the whistleblower usually in a position to make an independent assessment of the public interest considerations. The Ombudsman and the IGIS, on the other hand, are disinterested third parties who have powers and expertise to conduct full investigations to assess the allegations in their full context and to make judgments about the action required. Both the Ombudsman and the IGIS have the public interest as their primary concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public interest in creating a whistleblowing scheme is in the fair and independent investigation of allegations made by whistleblowers. Public disclosures may impair any investigation into the allegation. Whistleblowers who publicly disclose material after an investigation is complete will need to ensure that any such disclosure does not breach existing secrecy and privacy laws or the limits of their authorisation to disclose information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ombudsman will have a discretion to make public statements about whistleblowing matters as appropriate. The Ombudsman will also include information about whistleblowing in his or her annual report. Existing powers to make special reports to the Prime Minister or parliament by the Ombudsman or the MPRA will apply to the whistleblowing matters. The government has given detailed consideration to all of the committee's recommendations and acknowledges the substantial assistance it has obtained from the committee's report in formulating the first scheme for the protection of whistleblowers and the investigation of their allegations at the Commonwealth level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, let me canvass a couple of matters relating to the way in which this matter has been dealt with. The government has finally seen fit to produce a response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. The terms of reference for the committee were set on 2 September 1993 with the committee reporting in August 1994. It is now October 1995 and, of course, it is at this time that the government has finally seen fit to produce its response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) did advise that it would not be possible to meet normal reporting commitments to the parliament. He said that he proposed to have a response after the Christmas break, in early 1995, so it was almost eight months ago that one might have expected such a response. I am not aware of any further reports to the parliament indicating that there were reasons for delay, other than the comments now that the government deferred responding to that committee report to await a report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the protection of confidential and third-party information, the report of the inquiry of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, and the government's response to the Public Service Act Review Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing, when a Senate committee puts in as much work as was put into this report, and particularly given the commitment of my colleague Senator Jocelyn Newman to this particular cause which led to the setting up of this Senate select committee whose report the government is responding to, that, when the government deems it appropriate to bring a response forward, it does so largely without notice. It certainly did not see fit to provide a copy to Senator Newman, who was the chair of the committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have no indication as to what the government sees as an appropriate program to implement its response. I just draw attention to the question that was being asked by my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) as to when we might see some legislation to give effect to the government's acceptance of certain recommendations and the government's response. It also needs to be understood that in this matter the government has not adopted all of the committee's recommendations. The response is, in a sense, quite limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee inquiry into whistleblowing was a landmark. It highlighted the important role that whistleblowers could play in ensuring open and accountable government. It also revealed the enormous personal and professional sacrifices that many whistleblowers have made in doing what they believe was the right thing, that is, exposing corruption, waste, inefficiency or dangerous practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The life of a whistleblower can be a very lonely one. I think the Senate committee took some evidence in relation to that. It takes enormous courage for a person to take on an organisation, particularly one with which they have been associated, be it a company or a large government department. There is not much in the way of rewards for whistleblowers. I suppose they might be able, if they wrote books or something of this nature, to get some royalties. But the only real reward is being able to live with an honest conscience and the slight hope that their decision to blow the whistle may lead to a change for the better or that they are doing the organisation they work for a favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality, which was borne out in the Senate committee inquiry, is that many whistleblowers are ostracised or punished for their public-spirited actions. Some organisations, including government departments and private businesses, can make the life of a whistleblower pure hell. They can be subjected to total isolation in the workplace, they can be assigned meaningless work tasks, they can have to endure verbal and physical abuse and they can have their sanity questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, from personal friends who have been at the wrong end, I suppose, of companies that have been concerned about information which they were aware of and concerned about, that it can pose long-term jeopardy in employment terms for people who have been involved in private sector areas where these matters might be raised. Under the enormous pressure, the health of a whistleblower can suffer dramatically. Indeed, a person who sets out to do the right thing can be met with such a vindictive and unrelenting response that the end result can be very severe psychological stress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that it is a vicious cycle. The whistleblower is psychologically worn down and forced into a defensive position, leading to a decline in their performance and relationships with colleagues, giving the organisation ultimately an opportunity to sack that person for what they see as being inadequate performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whistleblowers are often made an example of, and usually for the worse. Instead of being rewarded and acknowledged for their public-spirited work in bringing forward information, they are frequently punished. Such treatment, of course, sends a clear message to other would-be whistleblowers. One of the reasons that this committee report came forward was to give people who take a public-spirited approach to these matters a way of being able to deal with them, and to protect them. It is in that context that I want to address the way in which the government has responded to the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not adopted all of the committee's recommendations. In fact, it seems to me that the principal recommendations have been largely avoided. I will draw attention in the first instance to the first and second series of recommendations. The first dealt with the need for a national education campaign. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  in order to enhance the campaign's acceptance and likelihood of success, strong public statements of support should be given at the political, senior management and union level.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect that as you read the response of the minister today you would hardly say that it is a glowing endorsement of whistleblowing. In fact, in its response the government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  as the proposed whistleblowing scheme will be a strengthening of existing policy, it will not be necessary to engage in a national education campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislative regime will be publicised by the Government and will become a part of existing information campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee went on to recommend:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the proposed national education campaign should involve recent developments in ethics and accountability as a base from which to emphasise, in positive terms for the organisation and ultimately the public interest, the benefits of reporting wrongdoing . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The government says that it still does not consider that a national education campaign is necessary on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the government takes this approach in a matter of this sort, yet when the matter involves citizenship the government thinks it necessary to have an education campaign which, over some 3 1/2 years, is going to involve $17 million of taxpayers' money. One ought not to be surprised that money can be found, and in very large leaks, if it suits the government's purpose, but if matters of a different character are involved quite a different approach is taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal recommendation developed by the committee was for a public interest disclosures agency, and it set out a very detailed proposed legislative regime for such an agency. The government's response has been to reject that. It has said in its response that it is not accepted. The government believes that the existing agencies&mdash;the Ombudsman, the Merit Protection and Review Agency and IGIS&mdash;will be the appropriate independent organisations upon which the government's proposed scheme will be based. The government goes to the point of even emphasising at the end of its response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not accept that a Public Interest Disclosures Board is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee believed that a public interest disclosures agency and the provisions of supporting legislation should be given the widest coverage constitutionally possible, but the government takes the view that it should not extend to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also has significant reservations about including government business enterprises in the proposed scheme, although it says that it will be considered after the government has responded to the report of the Administrative Review Council on related matters. The recommendations went on to cover academic institutions. The government makes it very clear that it is limited to Commonwealth officers and contractors and that any whistleblowing schemes in academic institutions are matters for those bodies themselves to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in relation to the health care industry, it takes the view that the scheme should not be extended to that area. It takes the view in relation to banking, and the Reserve Bank in particular, that it ought not to cover that area. The government does not accept either of the recommendations. It does not consider it appropriate to amend the charter of the Reserve Bank. I suppose what it is saying is that if there were a cosy deal between the Prime Minister and the Governor of the Reserve Bank which somebody was able to blow the whistle on, legislation ought not run to protecting people involved in that situation or for any investigation of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It deals with the Australian Federal Police. The committee recommended that the Australian Federal Police be covered by whistleblower protection legislation, yet the government takes the view that protection for whistleblowers and for independent investigation of their allegations is already in place in the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act. I guess it takes the view that all the arrangements are adequate, even while some officers and former officers of the Australian Federal Police have been the subject of quite significant criticism in the Wood royal commission in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government looks at the recommendation dealing with the matters that might be covered. The committee took the view that illegality, infringement of the law, fraudulent and corrupt conduct, as well as substantial misconduct, mismanagement, maladministration, gross and substantial waste of public funds and resources, endangering public health and safety, and danger to the environment ought to be matters to be covered. Yet we have outlined in the scheme that the government intends the Ombudsman should administer that certain limited categories of wrongdoing will be the subject of review&mdash;in other words, an indictable offence against the law of a state or territory. So it is not illegality, it is not infringement of the law, fraudulent or corrupt conduct, but it now has to be an indictable offence. What we are saying to people is that they have to form almost a legal judgment in relation to these matters before they can raise them in the context of the government's proposed legislation. That will have to be formed by the person before they can deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does go on to deal with gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety or danger to the environment. I think the only one there that is clearly covered is danger to the environment, amongst those matters that have been picked up by the committee&mdash;in other words, that had not been subject to a qualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it needs to be understood that the government has decided that whistleblowing issues should be addressed through existing agencies. It has certainly brought forward a response which has largely left to one side the committee's scheme that was proposed and a much more limited arrangement has been substituted by the government as a response to the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, we will be giving further consideration to these matters. The way in which the government has dealt with this matter needs to be seen as a step in the right direction, but one in which, I suggest, looking at the report that the government had before it, a great deal more could have been done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In resuming this debate this afternoon on this social security and veteran's affairs legislation, I first wish to respond to some of the comments that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the shadow minister for social security, made in his contribution to the debate yesterday afternoon. It will come as no surprise to the House that the honourable member for Berowra once more moved his regular amendment to the second reading motion, which he has done on every single occasion that we have had social security legislation before this House. He has moved that all words after `That' be omitted and then put forward a motion condemning the government for all sorts of sins and evil practices that we are alleged to have undertaken. It is becoming a very boring practice by the shadow minister and, unfortunately, it has absolutely no credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one listens to what the honourable member for Berowra had to say in response to this enormous package of amendments which will significantly improve the social security benefits of hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens, we find the regular trotting out of all sorts of condemnations for every possible savings measure that the government introduces in this legislation. Of course, any benefit that we actually provide is never seen as good enough and it has never gone far enough. Throughout his contribution to this debate yesterday afternoon he constantly used the term `mean-spirited'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It becomes a bit of a broken record when we hear the honourable member for Berowra speak on social security legislation, because he constantly attacks the government on its program on social security, yet never once does he actually enunciate a clearly stated opposition policy platform on social security. When one examines all of the commitments, promises and shady innuendo that the shadow minister puts forward as the opposition's position on social security, one starts to get a very interesting picture of the way in which the opposition is treating this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to understand that social security benefits touch the lives of the vast majority of Australians. Social security benefits go to things such as family payments, unemployment benefits and age pensions&mdash;a whole host of benefits that probably touch almost 75 or 80 per cent of Australian  families. Yet we never actually hear any substance from the opposition about what it would do. We have had all sorts of promises from the opposition on things. It is on the record that the honourable member for Berowra goes around to pensioner groups saying, `Yes, we would do all of these wonderful things if we were in power.' He has now been going around the community promising a universal pension, when he knows that that is an unachievable aim. He realises that such an offer would cost some $5 billion to the Commonwealth taxpayer. Yet he is going around suggesting that if they got into power that would be something they would be looking at and they would give the pension to everybody, regardless of their assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister has made all sorts of other promises about what he would do for the guardians allowance and for various groups in the community. When you actually add up all of the costs of these little suggestions and all of the criticisms and condemnations he makes about the government, you find that the opposition would have to spend several billion dollars more on social security than we currently spend. That stands in stark contrast with the aim and ambition of the opposition. If they are going to achieve some of their other commitments that they have made in policy pronouncements in and outside this place, they will have to make savings of around $9 billion to $12 billion a year from social security. </PARA>

If members of the opposition do not want a scare campaign, they should start telling people what their policies will be. What do they have to hide?

They do not want people to know what is behind those policies. They do not want to expose themselves to scrutiny, so they are not going to tell anybody in Australia what they are going to do. They will just spring all their policies on them a couple of weeks prior to the election so nobody will have any chance to scrutinise what impact they might have on families, the unemployed, age pensioners, veterans, other beneficiaries or the whole community, depending on what the policy package will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition do not want to tell anybody these policies because they might be exposed once more, yet they will go around the community and make all sorts of shady little promises and suggest all sorts of things like they are listening to people and know what their needs are. Yet, in reality, their basic, principal position that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) set out in his so-called headland statements he made in the last few months was a promise of smaller government, leaner government, and less taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition says he is going to achieve smaller government. Look at what the Labor Party has achieved. We have got the smallest bite on the nation's purse of any government in the last 50 years. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to make government leaner and meaner&mdash;the emphasis being on `meaner' when it comes to the opposition&mdash;he will have to massively slash expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will he slash expenditure? In the Commonwealth budget, one-third of all expenditure is in the social security portfolio. Another quarter of all expenditure is on health and community services. Those two portfolios touch the lives of every single Australian. They spend over 50 per cent of the Commonwealth's budget. The next area is in higher education, training, jobs and labour market programs. That is probably another 15 per cent of the Commonwealth budget.

We are accused of being mean-spirited. Let's start having some reality in this debate. Let's start having some specifics. What has the opposition got to hide? What is their secret agenda to attack the welfare of Australian families? When are they going to start being honest with the people of Australia and give us some detail?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they think they can go to this next election hiding all of their evil agenda behind their cloaks and hoping that they will fool the people of Australia, I am afraid they have another think coming. The people of Australia are much wiser and much more sensible than that. They are able to understand that, if the opposition is not prepared to put forward clear and specific policies, they have to look at the opposition's track record. The opposition's track record in the area of social security has been one of slash and burn, of wanting to cut benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's look at what they did to pensions. In their last period of government pensions fell to an all-time low. When John Howard was Treasurer, the average rate of pensions was only 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings. Under a Labor government, we have consistently increased those pensions and got the value of pensions back up to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We have continued to improve benefits to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition is not prepared to come forward with some details and some specifics about what they will do in social security or in any other portfolio area, we will have to be reliant on looking back on their track record and looking back on their previous policy pronouncements, such as in Fightback. We have to make the judgment that they will again be a slash and burn administration for the families of Australia and that they will cause havoc to social security recipients&mdash;some 80 per cent of Australian families, across the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition shadow spokesperson on social security made a number of comments. He claimed that he had very little notice of this legislation. It was introduced into the House some eight or nine days before we had to start debating it. He criticised the government for not giving pensioners and the rest of the community enough knowledge about this. That argument falls on very stony ground when you realise that almost every part of this bill is a budget measure. It was announced in this House as part of the budget. The opposition has had since May to read about what the government intended to do in these social security measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely false to accuse the government of not having told social security recipients about these measures. I have here a copy of a Department of Social Security letter sent in May to all age pensioners about the changes to deeming rules, which we are talking about in this legislation. I have here a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS> of June, which again sets out all the information about the budget measures that we are debating in this House today. So there has been ample opportunity for pensioners and other social security recipients around Australia to know about these clauses and to consider them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the overwhelming response from the aged community and from the social welfare community has been one of commendation and congratulations to the government for the measures that we have contained in this legislation. These are clearly pieces of legislation that will benefit social security recipients. They are supported by the aged community and by the social welfare community. So the mean-spiritedness in this debate all exists in the opposition's mind. It does not reflect the accurate situation with regard to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the opposition getting up on its hind legs and complaining about our position with Meridian Investment Trust. The shadow minister for social security claimed once more that our decision was mean-spirited. Let's look at what the government has announced with Meridian Investment Trust. We have decided that the government will extend the deeming measure. In reality, we have created a situation of providing a virtual lump sum to the people who are members of Meridian Investment Trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be making an ex gratia payment, calculated using the five and seven per cent deeming rates in line with the extended deeming provisions that will come into operation in July. This payment will be calculated as soon as possible and backdated to the next pension day. This means that we are providing the full benefit to those people and they will not be suffering as a result of the collapse of Estate Mortgage. We have taken into account their needs and given them a complete benefit. Again, the shadow minister claimed that this was being mean-spirited in dealing with these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of very positive measures in this bill. The most important one is the deeming on financial investments. The new measures that we are putting in place are a reflection of the major recommendation of the inquiry that was established by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and which resulted in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Targeting for equity</EMPHASIS>. It supported a broader deeming approach to investments as fairer and simpler. The federal government has agreed to extend deeming to financial investments, and this includes all bank, building society and credit union accounts; cash, term deposits, friendly society bonds and other managed investments; and shares, loans and debentures. But the measures will not affect the family home; car; stamp, coin and antique collections; life insurance policies; and farms, holiday homes and other real estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From July next year, the old rules about measuring the various capital growth and investment growth on those investments will no longer apply. All the financial investments will be assessed under the one set of rules. The lower deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of financial investments for single pensioners and the first $50,000 for couples. A higher rate of seven per cent will apply to the value of financial investments over these amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those deeming amounts have been set at a very conservative and quite an achievable level. The government has given some 15 months notice of these changes to enable pensioners to have plenty of time to make whatever arrangements are required to change their investments so that they are able to achieve those investment rules. We have also introduced a major expansion in the financial investment advisory service for pensioners to assist them in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not just changed the rules and left people to their own devices. We have also provided some significant additional free advice from the department to assist them to make whatever changes might be required. We have given them 15 months notice that these changes will occur. We have also said that, if they have to change their investment from one form to another in that period, they will not be penalised at all. Any capital growth they have that is measured in that time will not be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made the rules as reasonable and as fair as possible. The pensioner and aged communities in Australia have welcomed these changes and said that they are very progressive, fair and reasonable. They are all delighted. But the shadow minister criticises us and attacks us, saying that we are doing it too quickly. That is absolute bunkum. If he dares to actually consult with the aged community, which I know he is not prepared to do, he will find that they support the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a number of other changes. This legislation provides some significant improvements to carers' benefits. They have been broadly welcomed by the carer community. They have received quite significant support. There is a whole range of amendments contained in one of the bills that we are debating today which will make a significant contribution to supporting the caring role of families, especially as our population ages. The amendments recognise that many people who need full-time care often prefer to be cared for at home or in familiar surroundings. The changes brought forward in this legislation recognise that the people who perform the role of carer need financial support arrangements which are as flexible as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has listened carefully to the concerns raised by carer organisations and the International Year of the Family Council. The changes mean that people receiving care will no longer have to get a pension in order for their carer to qualify for the carer pension. From March next year, as long as their family income is less than $61,000 and their assets are worth less than half a million dollars, they will be able to have someone on a carer pension to look after them. These limits will rise in line with the basic family payment income and assets test. A number of other changes which have been introduced have been broadly welcomed by the carer community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add that there is a clause not appearing in this bill. It has been taken out as a result of this government listening to the community and, particularly, listening to the backbench on this side of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I get sick and tired of hearing government members criticise the opposition for failing to have disclosed all of our policies for the next election, which could well be up to six months away. If honourable members opposite had a reasonable memory, they would know that in the Australian political tradition political parties usually announce their policies some six weeks prior to the actual election date, at the commencement of the formal campaign period. There are, of course, occasions when political parties differ from this arrangement, but the standard practice has been that parties announce their policies at the commencement of the election campaign. One only has to go back to the time prior to the election of 1983 to appreciate that the Labor Party did not release its policy until the election was actually called.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who in a very short space of time will be the Prime Minister of this nation, has made a series of headland speeches in which he has outlined the general policy thrust and direction of the coalition. In effect, he has been indicating what we stand for, and I believe this is well recognised in the Australian community. It is very clear that this government is absolutely desperate. It is absolutely terrified of being tossed from office at the next election. That is why it is urging us constantly to release our policy proposals precipitately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a pledge to the Australian people. At the time of the next election, the coalition's policies will be clearly on the table. They will be open for full scrutiny and we are quite happy to be judged on our policies. We will, however, release our policies at an appropriate time, prior to the election. There is no question of our going into the election without policies. We will have policies. They will be firm, decisive policies. Those policies will be a recipe for the recovery of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Labor Party over the last 13 years has a sad and sorry history in government. It has presided over the widening of the gap between rich and poor in this nation. The government will be absolutely thrashed at the next election because of its failure to deal with the major problems confronting Australia. We have perhaps two million people unable to find adequate work. We have 800,000 people unable to find a job. Yet this government has masqueraded as the champion of the underprivileged. It is a fraud and it will be rejected as such at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills we are discussing today are the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. As has been indicated by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), this legislation has been rushed into the House, obviously with a view to clearing the decks for the next election. Indeed, the government has introduced this legislation, which, we admit, includes partly budget measures but also non-budget measures. There are changes to what the government outlined at the time of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the two bills and the explanatory memoranda resulting from those bills, we see a total of 741 pages. Yet on these very major bills the government is permitting the Australian community very little debate. With bills and explanatory memoranda of 741 pages, what the government is doing with the introduction of this legislation is treating the parliament like a sausage machine; it is not letting the legislation lie on the table clearly for full debate in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus my colleague the shadow minister has indicated that the coalition will be moving an amendment to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which is in the following form:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)failing to advise Australians adequately that it estimates that the extended deeming rules will result in 207,000 pensioners suffering a decrease in their pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)its failure to adequately assist investors of the Meridian Investment Trust who have been disadvantaged by the unrealised capital gains provisions currently contained in Part 3.10 of the Social Security Act,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)failing to address the potentially adverse impact of the extended deeming rules on the holders of investments in friendly societies".</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that an election is just around the corner. It is also clear from public indications that the coalition has made that we are prepared to stand up in this place and in the Australian community to give support to investors in the Meridian Investment Trust. We find that the government belatedly is trying to do something for those people who were disadvantaged as a result of the collapse of Estate Mortgage. What the government is doing is not enough, but certainly it is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the government has been sorely embarrassed into responding to the plight of the Meridian Investment unit holders. Of course, as I have said, we were going to publicly, in this place, expose the government for what it was. The government's response, in our view, is inadequate. All the government seeks to do is to make provision for an ex gratia payment. As the honourable member for Berowra has said, this is a mean-spirited response and, in my view, it is totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike other holders of saved investment, Estate Mortgage unit holders will be deemed to have earned income of either five per cent or seven per cent on their investment. The opposition has proposed that these investments would have been entirely exempt until July next year when the new deeming arrangements would commence for all investments, including those now regarded as saved investments. The government has done a backflip in relation to the investment holders in the Meridian Investment Trust. It is not too late for the government to adopt the proposal as suggested by the opposition. I can see that the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) has come into the chamber. I would ask that she consider adopting the proposals which have been put forward by the honourable member for Berowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills before the chamber at the moment were provided to the coalition only just over a week ago. As I have pointed out, they are very lengthy bills. When one looks at the total number of pages in the bills and explanatory memoranda, it is very clear that eight days is simply not an adequate time in which to digest the complexity of them. I think the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) pointed out that these were budget measures. They are certainly partly budget measures. But the opposition must look closely at the fine print of any legislation because, in many cases, the devil is in the detail. The government is introducing more than 40 amendments to the act, and we believe that these amendments should be subjected to the closest of parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do understand that part of the reason for the delay in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill was the fact that the government needed to have it reprinted at public expense to remove the measure announced in the budget, to remove women under the age of 40 from the wives pension. The government announced that certain law changes would be made in the budget and the government has now done a backflip. Clearly, people in Australia, before they know what the budget is ultimately going to mean, must look at the detail of legislation passed through this House because quite often what becomes law is very substantially different from what is initially proposed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about the area of valuation of investments. The government has argued the new deeming rules are attractive because they will create certainty. Payments will not move up and down depending on the value of their investments. But no provision has been made in the bill to determine how often the assets of a person are to be valued. At present, people are required to notify the department each time the value of their assets changes and their pension will be adjusted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a penalty involved if a person fails to advise the department of a change which leads to a debt due. People will be in the same uncertain position under the new rules as they were under the previous unrealised capital gains tax provisions. Apparently, the department aims to achieve a system which is administratively workable and is the least demanding method on the recipients as possible. The system in the form it is to take must be enshrined in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the matter should be referred to the Senate Community Affairs Committee to consider the issue of appropriate timing and regularity of valuation and, if possible, amendments should be made to incorporate an appropriate scheme. It could provide for valuation at the election of beneficiaries if no scheme is outlined by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to budget savings, we notice the government has lauded the new system as being advantageous to recipients, but the Labor government has estimated it will result in savings of $62.58 million in 1996-97 and $65.02 million in 1997-98. The government has estimated that 270,000 pensioners and part pensioners will see a decrease in the pension if they do not rearrange their assets to meet or exceed the deeming rates. Pensioners or part pensioners who lose their pension will also lose their fringe benefit entitlements arising from concession cards. Given the drop in interest rates and the way in which many pensioners and retirees have been so affected adversely by those drops in interest rates, it is very clear that many of them depend on the fringe benefit entitlements and on the concession cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government itself estimates that 120,000 people will see an increase in their pension on average of only about $4 a week. One does not have to go to many department stores or supermarkets to realise that $4 does not go very far. It ought to be recognised that this bill and these changes are an initiative of the Labor government. I hope that at the next election people will remember this fact. Even if people are only first affected in July 1996, after the election, after there has been a change of government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable concerns have been expressed, particularly by members of the Australian Friendly Societies Association, about changes made in the area of friendly society bonds. Members and senators on this side of the parliament, and I suspect those opposite, have received representations from the peak friendly societies organisation and maybe from individual members of those friendly societies. The Australian Friendly Societies Association has asserted that provision should be made to treat tax prepaid investments, such as friendly society bonds, differently from products on which tax is not prepaid but the investor pays tax at their own marginal tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association argues that returns from prepaid tax products will necessarily be lower than those available to non-pre-tax paid investments as the tax has been paid prior to the distribution to the investor.

There are approximately 400,000 pensioners with total investments of $2.8 billion. The association has made a number of alternative suggestions which could solve the problem which the government's legislation is going to create. Those suggestions include the possibility of introducing a differential deeming rate for pre-tax paid investments which take account of the fact that tax has been paid prior to distribution to the investor; the pensioner being able to remain in the bond and being assessed on realisation&mdash;that is, maintaining the current practice&mdash;and amending division 8A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable friendly societies to provide income stream products which allow pensioners to switch to the product without tax penalty. </PARA>

We believe these are matters which should also be considered by the Senate Community Affairs Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is given only 20 minutes to speak on legislation in this place. The government has brought in two very large bills. It has given the parliament only eight days to peruse the draft of the legislation. Yet we find there are going to be amendments to the drafts as printed. It is clear that the government is seeking to pump this legislation through the parliament as quickly as possible. I get sick and tired of hearing members opposite suggest that they somehow are the repository of care and concern for the underprivileged. We have only to look at the appalling record of this government in increasing the inequities in Australia to appreciate that when people like the honourable member for Moreton claim that the government is the party of the battlers they are entirely out of order. The opposition is prepared to stand up for all Australians, including the Aussie battler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 13 years there have been five federal elections and the Labor Party has been returned on every occasion. The government has been prepared to lie, rob and cheat its way into office. This government is prepared to say absolutely anything to gain the support of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last election the Prime Minister, not expecting that he would be returned to office, made an enormous number of promises which he and the government had absolutely no intention of keeping. We also found that they sought to misrepresent the very detailed policies released at that time by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation now where we are in the run-up to the next election. It might well be held on 2, 9 or 16 December. It might well be held some time in February, March, April or May. The Prime Minister is desperately looking for an opportunity to go to the people with a chance of success. But with the appalling record of this government it is very clear that this government will be swept from office whenever the election is called. While we do not really care when it is held, we invite the Prime Minister to go to the Governor-General. We want an election now. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the member for Burke might be one of those who has taken a bet on it in my favour. I want to speak about the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, and I will be doing so in two parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pleasure to speak on this bill because it contains measures introduced by the budget earlier this year. The opposition have known about them since that time, so I do not know why they are whingeing now about suddenly having to debate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also brings in other measures which are basically revisions of existing measures and legislation. They show that this government is very good at listening to people&mdash;listening to those who receive social security benefits, to those who care for them, and to those out in the community who have brought to us, as their local members, and to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), matters that need changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those changes&mdash;I thank my friend and colleague the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his kind words, saying that this is another Deahm amendment&mdash;resulted from a committee that I chaired. That committee was itself a result of the government's move to equalise eligibility for the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the pension age for women will be changed to 65, to be phased in over 20 years. While the opposition castigated us for that move, in their promises before the last election they were also going to bring in this change, but phased in over 10 years, which would have created more hardship for a lot more women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, any sort of change like this affects a wide number of people. I suspect that in the future most women will have superannuation and will not be needing a pension. The women who will actually have to wait until 65 for an age pension are younger women now who have become used to equal pay and equal opportunity&mdash;although this benefit is not by any means fully available to all women&mdash;but accept the fact that if they want to be treated equally they have to accept the equal pension age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there were a lot of women in their mid- to late 50s who saw this as a problem&mdash;women who were ill, women who were hanging on, waiting to retire because they were, frankly, exhausted, and women whose marriages had broken up and have had to go out to work later in life. There was a raft of circumstances. A lot of those women came to see me, and as a result of members&mdash;particularly the women in the government&mdash;talking to the minister about this the minister decided to set up a committee which would consult with the unions and other groups to see what could be done to phase in that change for those women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am flattered that the minister asked me to chair that committee. We asked for and received a number of submissions from a number of groups&mdash;pensioner groups, the Council on the Ageing, the Older Women's Network, various other groups, and trade unions. As a result, we now have the changes in the mature age allowance, which is one of the cornerstones of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mature age allowance, as most people would know, was brought in in March 1994, and it had a June 1996 sunset clause. It was brought in as an interim measure to assist older, long-term unemployed people. Those are people who are aged 60 and over but who are below the pension age. At that stage it was only men, because at that stage 60 was the cut-off time for women. Those people faced particular disadvantage because if they had been made redundant or they had lost their job for some reason it was very difficult to find another job at the age of 60 or over. So we brought in the mature age allowance, which gave them pension rates and benefits. But we have found that longer term unemployed people will not suddenly phase out at June 1996. This measure was a means of helping those women who were going to be disadvantaged when they turned 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the new measures brought in in this bill are, first of all, to remove the sunset clause of June 1996. Also to be removed is the requirement that the recipient be registered with the CES for the previous 12 months. The payment will now be moved to the allowance system. An entitlement will be assessed under the allowance income and assets test rather than under the pension income and assets test. Also, applicants will be required to establish that they have been receiving an income support payment and have no recent work experience. For the purposes of this bill, the definition of no recent work experience is that they have not been employed for more than 20 hours a week for a total of 13 weeks in the previous 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current requirement that a person must have been in receipt of income support for at least 12 months will be reduced to nine months, and that must be nine months on some sort of income support&mdash;such as jobsearch allowance or newstart allowance. They will also be removed from the non-activity tested payment. I am referring, for instance, to people on carer pensions, disability support pensions and parenting allowance. They did not have to be on jobsearch allowance; they could be on one of those other benefits. Those people will now be eligible for the mature age allowance. A lot of those women will have already been on a carer's pension, looking after a husband or a child who was disabled or ill. They will now be able to move across to the mature age allowance. I have a lot more to say on a lot of other issues, but I will end on that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

What we see with average weekly ordinary time earnings at the level they are now at, around five per cent, with the inflation rate underlying it at around three per cent, is very strong growth in real incomes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made the point in the House a few days ago that what the coalition have in mind is putting the Commonwealth's income tax powers across to the states, to have state income taxes. Let me again refer to the quotations by the shadow Treasurer in an article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Opposition Leader and shadow treasurer, Peter Costello, describes Commonwealth/state financial relations as "an important issue that has to be addressed". He says states' reliance on Commonwealth grants, so-called vertical fiscal imbalance, is "something we will be dealing with in our first term".</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, `something we will be dealing with in our first term'. The smother which Mr Costello then raced to publish&mdash;that was his denial&mdash;said, `No, I was only interested in a fixed share of Commonwealth income tax.' A fixed share of Commonwealth income tax only exacerbates the so-called vertical fiscal imbalance, because a fixed share of Commonwealth income tax is still a financial assistance grant. It is a bag of money with `financial assistance grants' written on it. In fact, under his formula, it would be a bigger bag of money. So the vertical fiscal imbalance is exacerbated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no repair of the supposed imbalance without giving the states more powers to raise their own revenue. That is the definition of it. Those who argue that the imbalance exists say that the states spend more money than they raise and to remove the imbalance you have to let the states raise more money. Giving them a larger share of Commonwealth income tax does not let them raise more money in their own right at all; it just gives them more Commonwealth money and more financial assistance grants. It exacerbates vertical fiscal imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the shadow Treasurer said `an important issue to be addressed and something we will be dealing with', he meant giving the states tax powers. That is what he meant; it is the only thing he could have meant. We find out today that Access Economics has done a very big study for the conservative states, which includes a state consumption tax. When the article said that other tax options include a state based consumption tax, the journalist who wrote it was right. Here is Access Economics now doing the states' work. We saw Mr Kennett yesterday belling the cat further, saying, `Not only should the Commonwealth get out of these things, but we should have 80 per cent of the funds.' He said that the Commonwealth should go back to national priorities such as telecommunications, the air force and defence&mdash;in other words, out of social spending, out of health and out of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Premier who has taken $280 million out of Victorian hospitals. These are the same people who, when they have the powers, diminish what they will spend on them. What they want to do&mdash;this is the whole conservative agenda&mdash;is rob the Commonwealth of money and keep it out of functions and put the functions back to the states. Mr Kennett said that the remaining 80 per cent would go to the states and to the people of the states who generate the wealth. It is not the people of the states; it is the people of Australia who generate the wealth. This is one century on from Federation.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3089" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard such claims made several times by the Leader of the Opposition, including in this question time. Of course, this comparison by the Leader of the Opposition is a completely false one. Perhaps the starting point for consideration of it is that we should always remember&mdash;when we hear comments from the Leader of the Opposition about interest rates and about mortgage repayments&mdash;that when he was Treasurer he left this country in a recession with interest rates higher than they are at the present time, when the economy has been growing for over four years. So, in a recession, he had higher interest rates than we have in a growth economy. That is the record of the Leader of the Opposition in terms of interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of this issue about a 50 per cent increase in mortgage repayments, what is involved in this is a totally dubious and artificial comparison of average monthly mortgage repayments. Apparently what the Leader of the Opposition has done has been to take the average home loan in 1983, adjust it for inflation, apply an interest rate of 12.5 per cent to obtain an estimate of the monthly repayments on that loan in today's dollars and then compare that figure with how much monthly repayments would be on an average loan this year if the interest rate on that loan was 10.5 per cent, the current bank and building society rate. Then of course he throws in some considerable rounding up for good measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a totally shonky exercise. It is shonky for a number of reasons. Firstly, there is the use of the 12.5 per cent mortgage rate in 1983. This was a figure that was available on a very limited basis. Perhaps we should bear in mind that, just before that last election, it was cut. That is interesting! Just before that last election, he cut the interest rate from 13.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. But, even at that 12.5 per cent rate, it was a rate which was available on a very limited basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it was a highly regulated number, banks were unwilling to lend too much on that. After a certain level, you had to go and cocktail it up with other personal loans, or higher interest rate loans of one sort or another, or go to building societies or other sources of finance&mdash;all more costly. So the real mortgage rate was well above 12.5 per cent. The building society rate in March 1983 was 13.9 per cent, which is a better indicator of what the market rates were than the 12.5 per cent figure. Obviously, at that point, you are looking at a considerable increase over the interest rate of 12.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But bear in mind also that, since that period, we have had a process of much higher loans evaluations being granted by home finance bodies. This is partly because low income earners, who normally have very small deposits, are more involved in housing these days. They could not get into housing back in those regulated days in large part because they could never get enough deposit. So they were locked out of the system&mdash;a point that was actually acknowledged by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in a rare moment of revealing the truth of the past. Talking to a CEDA conference in July 1994, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the system of credit controls that prevailed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is back in 1983&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">banks refused to lend to borrowers who did not have a record of saving with them, and refused to lend to borrowers who could not offer generous security against their loans. This made it harder for the lower income groups to compete for housing finance against the middle-income groups, and forced them to seek out housing finance through alternative and more costly forms of finance.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acknowledged that low income earners were largely locked out of the system and therefore could not get into a system of home finance, except at very costly rates of interest. Housing finance is much more widely available. Low income people can get loans at substantial loan to valuation, and that brings them a chance of becoming home owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average new home loan in 1983 as a percentage of the average house price was 50 per cent, and today it is 63 per cent. So that shows that the average loan to valuation has considerably increased. In other words, mortgages are bigger because the loans are bigger because you can get a larger proportion of the home price of a loan. There is also the fact, as we all know, that home loans are increasingly able to be used for other purposes than the actual purchase of the house. Everyone here has seen the Commonwealth Bank advertisements, for instance, with various items piled on top of the house, including a swimming pool and a car. That is because you can these days use your home mortgage to finance aspects of your expenditure other than the house itself. Therefore, home loans become bigger for that purpose. Also, houses today are bigger than they were in 1983. In fact, on average they are 18 per cent bigger.</PARA>

The bottom line on housing finance is this: the cost of a mortgage is the interest rate. The interest rates today are less than they were in 1983 in a recession. In fact, today you can get interest rates which are well below the 10 1/2 per cent rate. You can get mortgage originator rates down to as low as 8.7 per cent compared with the building society rates which were predominantly available at the time when Mr Howard was Treasurer at 13.9 per cent. That is a 37 per cent reduction.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industrial tribunals have traditionally taken the view that sick leave exists to meet the fact that sickness may strike anyone. It is not a right that an employee gains by virtue of the performance of his duties.</PARA>
<PARA>The government wholeheartedly agrees with that full bench view. We will never condone the prospective cashing out of sick leave, wherever it might occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the coalition, particularly the member for Flinders and indeed the Leader of the Opposition, have fulsomely supported the Tweed Valley decision. Even Phil Gude in Victoria said he would not agree to the trading away of sick leave conditions. That is how bad those sitting opposite are. They support the agreement, an agreement which the full bench today found reduced a number of award entitlements, including annual leave loading, smokos, public holidays and meal breaks, and at the same time increased working hours from 38 to 40.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full bench found that on the employer's own calculations&mdash;Tweed Valley's own calculations&mdash;some employees in the first 12 months would be more than 3.5 per cent worse off than under their comprehensive award. Further, it found that the employer's methodology was deficient, only having regard to a limited number of award reductions. Finally, it found that the agreement resulted in a net reduction in wages for some junior employees. So they just about got everyone in this terrific little trimmer that has been endorsed by those sitting opposite but today rejected by the full bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the Tweed Valley agreement was found wanting, just as it is not surprising that the coalition supported it because, as we know, they are all about slashing award conditions, and always have been. Today they have gone public and have said that they are in favour of equal pay for work of equal value. They are in support of family leave as well. What a great breakthrough that is. We have waited weeks for this latest revelation. `People are entitled', says the bleeding heart member for Flinders, `to what they've already got.' He is actually going to say that he is prepared to let them keep equal pay for work of equal value. He is prepared to let them keep their family leave. How generous can you get?

Thanks to the Tweed Valley case&mdash;can I conclude by saying&mdash;we know that the coalition will not protect people's sick leave. We know it very clearly because they came out and rushed to embrace this agreement.

But, when we put the transfer payments into it and we put Medicare into it, it really makes a very large difference, a huge difference, to those people who are on lower incomes.

As I said, the reason why I invoked 304A was that, in my view, it interrupted the flow of the minister and in fact was not a reasonable point of order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today was one of those days when the government decided that the opposition had policies as opposed to those days when it attacked us for not having policies. In addition to doing that, it found time to try to cover up some of its activities throughout recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to begin by referring to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). There it was, loud and clear for everyone to see: this minister was caught red-handed being unable to answer a very simple question, which did come under his portfolio, about the arrangements associated with his visit to Gallipoli. The reason is that he is up to his neck in waging this campaign against His Excellency the Governor-General by leaking information to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> and setting up this huge article. He has been quoted indirectly as being one of the Labor team who is now very upset with the modus operandi of His Excellency the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it on the record of this House that we live in a robust democracy and that we have a robust Governor-General. I expect that in the 1990s he is going to have things to say from time to time.

The minister who leaked in absolute terms was none other than the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who was exposed so loudly and clearly today. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the interjection of the minister at the table about a former leader. I just happen to have some notes about what former leaders say about current leaders, including the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Who said that he had erratic behaviour and that everyone is worrying about his judgment? Bob Hawke said that about the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, on page 497 of his memoirs. It gets better. What else did he have to say? On page 498 he described the Prime Minister as vainglorious, arrogant, disloyal and contemptuous. On page 499, he described him as disingenuous, churlish and inaccurate. Then he said, `He was deliberately lying to me.' These are just some of the accusations made by Bob Hawke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is: this government has been misleading this country for far too long. Its time is up. Whilst at the United Nations earlier this week the Governor-General, because of the badly written speech, was unable to complete the paragraphs relating to French nuclear testing&mdash;it is very unfortunate that that was so, and the blame for that rests with Minister Evans&mdash;this government has now run out of time with regard to the good governance of this country and with regard to the economic management of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that was reflected in many ways in the statistics this country was officially presented with yesterday; that is, the CPI figure of 1.2 per cent, or 5.1 per cent on an annualised basis. What does that mean at family level? What does that mean for the battlers of Bankstown, Bourke, Balranald and beyond? I have done some research into those figures and applied them on a dollar basis. What do I find with those CPI increases in relation to the poorest 20 per cent of families, the battling families? The past 12 months of inflation have increased their costs by some $25 a week. That works out at some nine per cent. With regard to mortgage, it is more like 50 per cent, as the Leader of the Opposition has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the news gets even worse. At the other end of the scale, the increase in household expenditure of the richest families, whose incomes average more than $1,700 a week, represents just 2.5 per cent of the family's income. In other words, the battlers get forced further and further behind by the economic mismanagement of this government. Tragically, the gap between rich and poor is getting wider and wider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another chilling statistic. I think this statistic is perhaps the most disturbing of the ones that have currency at the moment. In 1995, there are 150,000 more children living in families where neither parent is employed than was the case in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that the retiring president of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, Jim Maher, stood up to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), eyeball to eyeball, at a recent union conference. I think it is worth quoting the exact words of Jim Maher because I think the parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), probably has a degree of respect for Mr Maher. Maybe he doesn't; he may be part of another faction. I will check with him later. Some of you, somewhere, might just happen to have a bit of respect for Mr Maher. This is what this shop steward happened to say, eyeball to eyeball, to the Deputy Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many people in Australia today who are suffering, and suffering hard. Families trying to bring up children rear them and education them in the current environment is not easy. They can truly be described as battlers. I would hope for the future that the government will, whatever other promises it makes, attempt to look after those genuine families who are struggling today.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is from their own, in a sense&mdash;from their own official family, in a sense. That is a direct highlighting of the plight of the battler, of the increasing gap between rich and poor and of the economic mismanagement of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government always tries to cover up that economic mismanagement by focusing on our policies, which will deliver for the battlers, which will begin the huge task of reining in the huge foreign debt, which will genuinely look after the family and bridge the educational gap which is developing in this country, and which will in fact turn around this economy and bring about not five minutes of economic sunshine and not even five months of economic sunshine, but solid, continuing, sustainable growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that, the legacy of mismanagement of Labor, leaving the battlers out of the equation, can best be manifested by looking at some key statistics. Total government revenue has increased by some 30 per cent since Paul Keating became Prime Minister. Over the next three years, government revenue is estimated to increase by a further 21 per cent, with taxation revenue increasing by 23 per cent. Indeed, taxation revenue this financial year is going up by some 8.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the taxation revenue increase exceeding the enlarged CPI rate, thus showing what is truly happening to the battlers. And, of course, the Commonwealth government's own debt, excluding the states, has risen by 130 per cent over the period that Keating has simply been Prime Minister as opposed to previously when he was Treasurer. But perhaps it is time to remind the House of a certain event which took place on 15 July 1967. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a particularly extraordinary event. I know we get lectured on history by the frontbench from time to time, so I have been going back in history too. I have found that, on that particular day, a Mr John McInnes was carrying out his duties as menswear manager in the Bankstown David Jones store. In fact, I have found that on that particular day history will record that Mr McInnes sacked one Paul Keating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Mr McInnes sack Paul Keating? It is on the file. Mr McInnes described him as: surly, arrogant, rude, unmanageable, could never find him: sacked&mdash;and Paul Keating has not changed along the way. Indeed, somewhere in the archives of David Jones there is a file that is marked `would not re-engage'. If only David Jones had put that in their prospectus last week they would have got twice the take-up rate for their shares. That action of Mr McInnes all those years ago, I think, was a very early summary of this person who by one method or another is now Prime Minister and on whom the clock is ticking&mdash;and the clock is ticking very, very fast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the Deputy Prime Minister. Let us show how he exposed what perhaps might be the true agenda of Labor in their lingering weeks and days in government. I refer to the tax agenda of Labor: their fuel excise tax increases, their sales tax increases and their other increases. Members will recall a comment made by the Deputy Prime Minister in the House on Monday when he was asked to rule out tax increases. What did he say? Do you remember what he said? The Deputy Prime Minister, when asked in very clear terms whether he would rule out tax increases, said, `Why would we do that?' In other words, he said, by implication, `That is our agenda; there is more to come.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be more tax increases under Labor&mdash;as demonstrated by the famous Dawkins budget after the last election; as demonstrated by the l-i-e, l-a-w tax cuts lost to this country; as demonstrated especially by what they did with regard to fuel excise tax. The Deputy Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag, let the situation emerge where Labor are fudging again on tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The electors, and the battlers especially, of this country, and the small business operators of this country, have absolutely every right to be terrified of what is in store for them in the very unlikely event that Labor are returned to government&mdash;which they will not be. The people of Australia have had enough. They have seen what has happened with their interest rates. They have seen what has happened with inflation. They have seen what has happened with unemployment. They are getting a little sick and tired of a Prime Minister who comes in and rewrites figure after figure, rewrites and reinterprets and reinvents figure after figure, even when they are official ABS figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede one little thing with regard to our current and terminating Prime Minister&mdash;and that is, he is a spin doctor extraordinaire. Whichever way the figures go, he will move to pick out the elements, inject new elements and totally falsify the interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that famous youth unemployment press conference which he gave. It was the one where he decided to do the big U-turn and come into the courtyard smiling. We all were in deep shock, actually: he came smiling to his press conference. He stood in front of the media whom he loves so dearly, the press gallery whom he loves so dearly these days&mdash;I mean, there is Margot Kingston over there in Cambridge and elsewhere, missing, and he is still happy and he still put on this great presentation. This was the famous post-Rupert Murdoch `the economy is a disgrace' press conference. I remember it very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in the middle of this press conference? Not only did he almost lose his lines completely because his smiles were getting tangled up with the lines&mdash;I mean, it was a quite extraordinary press conference&mdash;but, in fact, he invented a youth unemployment figure for which he was roundly chastised because he could not verify it. He decided to arbitrarily reduce youth unemployment from 26.7 per cent to somewhere around nine per cent. He was caught red-handed by the shadow minister; he was caught red-handed by people in ACOSS and people across the board who said, `This is one lie too many; we are not going to cop it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has no realisation of what is happening out there in small business. He has no idea of what is happening out there in those areas still affected by horrific drought. He has no idea of what is happening in those sectors still suffering from recession and in the real suburbs, which are a long way from the very cloistered locations to which the Prime Minister goes when visiting capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to the House that it is about time to bring on an election. It is about time to give the people the right to pass judgment with regard to this shocking record of government. It is about time we had the chance to decide on the fate of this Prime Minister. I am just a bit amused about the matter of leadership being mentioned by the member for Werriwa. I have an old paper here&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>, `MPs plot against Keating'. It is not 1990. It is not 1991. In fact the date is September 1995&mdash;only a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is not quite in order to display these papers in the chamber. It is quite embarrassing for members of the government. I say in very loud and clear terms: time is up on this government.

In respect of this matter of public importance, a man called Jack McInnes, former David Jones employer, sacked Paul Keating back in 1967.

Those figures come from the annual report, tabled just today, of the Inspector-General on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act.

In these bills, parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1995-96 under Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. </PARA>

After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $917 million in appropriations for 1995-96, an increase of about 2 1/2 per cent on the amounts made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the 1995-96 budget. </PARA>

Running costs appropriations provide for the recurrent and minor capital costs of agencies in providing government services. The total supplementation for running costs for all departments and agencies&mdash;including defence military and civilian personnel&mdash;of $433 million represents an increase of 3.5 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). A number of factors contribute to this increase. </PARA>

Other major factors affecting running costs estimates include the impact of actual compared with estimated carryovers from 1994-95, borrowings against the forward estimates and some additional funding for departments associated with workload changes provided for under the running costs arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gross additional estimates of some $187 million are sought for the defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report I have just presented arose from the execution, by officers of the Australian Federal Police, of a search warrant on the electorate office of the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) on 26 July. The committee was required to consider whether a contempt had been committed in connection with the execution of the warrant. In the course of its inquiry, the committee was assisted by written submissions from the member for Stirling and from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. In addition, the member for Stirling appeared before the committee on 21 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Stirling did not argue that the Australian Federal Police officers involved had acted improperly. The substance of his concern was the disruption caused to his office during the search, the removal of certain information and the effect that the actions had on his ability to perform his duties as a member. The honourable member quoted from statements by citizens expressing concern about the confidentiality of information which might be provided to his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee appreciates the position in which this matter placed Mr Cameron, it has found that, although the actions complained of amounted to interference in the performance by Mr Cameron of his duties as a member, the interference was not improper interference. Accordingly, the committee has concluded that no contempt was committed by the officers involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the general issue, it is no reflection on the Australian Federal Police to note that the present reference has illustrated the extent to which the execution of a search warrant can disrupt the work of an electorate office. The committee acknowledges that there is no parliamentary immunity which would exempt electorate offices from the execution of such search warrants. It recognises, however, that members' electorate offices are vital to the performance of their duties as members and are important to constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members and their assistants are called upon to help in many matters and they come into possession of much confidential and sensitive information. As an interim measure, the committee considers that the proper operation of electorate offices and the assistance and services provided to constituents would justify the negotiation of an understanding which would not impede the operations of the law enforcement authorities between the minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police and the Speaker in respect of search warrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that such an understanding would not create any immunity for members; it would not seek to change the statutory provisions. But it would enable some ground rules to be agreed, at least in so far as the Australian Federal Police were concerned, so as to recognise the reasonable interests of members and their constituents, particularly in respect of sensitive or confidential information. It could, for example, be agreed that a third party be given custody of documents a member wished to withhold and that such documents could be held pending resolution of the member's claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee therefore recommends that the House request the Speaker to initiate discussions with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), with the objective of reaching such an understanding. The committee would be very pleased to assist in this process. I repeat: the committee is not seeking an additional privilege or immunity for members in this matter. Rather, it is suggesting that some guidance should be available to assist when these matters arise, to the benefit of constituents, not just members and their assistants. </PARA>

In May of this year, just prior to the state election, the then ALP member for Gladstone, Neil Bennett, wrote to all residents promising a high school for Boyne/Tannum by the beginning of 1997. At last, after six long years, the Goss government reiterated its earlier promise that a high school would be built at Boyne/Tannum. But, to demonstrate its arrogance again, the debate turned from when to where the school would be built&mdash;another stalling mechanism. </PARA>

Calliope Shire CEO Graeme Kanofski described the EIS as `a sham and a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Council recreation officer Nick Alderson reported that the Canoe Point site with its melaleuca wetlands, mangroves and rainforest was of `vital importance' and `an essential component of the overall reserve'. Similarly, the Capricorn Conservation Council has expressed its opposition to the Canoe Point site because development there would endanger vegetation unique to the area. If that was not enough, 762 Boyne/Tannum residents signed a petition earlier this month urging the government to consider a site more suitable for a high school than Canoe Point. </PARA>

There has been obstruction, prevarication and stonewalling. It is time this nonsense stopped. The need is clear. The acceptable site is available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To open up competition to cable TV, Telstra and Optus Vision will be laying cables. Telstra plans to lay 80 per cent of them underground with 20 per cent above ground and Optus is planning to put up aerial cabling, which will include pay TV, local phone calls and eventually an interactive service for personal computers. Optus says that this cable is only 17 millimetres in width&mdash;that of a five cent piece&mdash;and is placed at least a metre below the regular power lines. Optus says it is for safety of installation and maintenance purposes but I also suspect it is due to interference with electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at this stage, from the photos that I have seen from Blacktown where the aerial cable has been installed, it is very unsightly. It is black and it appears much thicker than has been indicated. As a result of the lack of information, it was necessary for the Drummoyne Council to go to the Blacktown area and take these photographs. Despite obvious differences in urban form, initial concerns regarding the visual impacts of the cabling have been confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that have arisen include the thickness and colour of the cable being inconsistent with existing cables; the location of cables, over a metre below existing lines, lowering and extending the layer of wires and cable, making it more conspicuous; the visual impact at intersections being particularly intrusive; the connections to individual premises being prominent; and the overall cumulative impact of cabling increasing the visual clutter of the streetscape and being a retrograde step in providing a quality urban environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optus maintain that these cables can run safely through trees and therefore they do not need to be trimmed. Optus also claim that they will not install cabling in heritage areas. I also understand that Optus and Telstra will both be paying rent to the electricity companies and that, should an electricity company or council decide to incur the expense and put electric wires underground, Optus are willing to share the expense of going underground instead of using aerial cabling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that people will have an option of phone companies with regular local calls capped at 25c as a maximum, cable TV and other activities. Optus, incidentally, has the Disney channel. But for people who do not wish to take this option up, or even for those who do, it must be done in an aesthetically acceptable way. Underground is expensive and sometimes impractical but, if aerial cabling is to proceed without community outrage, it needs to be thin, discreet cabling, light in colour and closer to the existing power lines and therefore less intrusive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken this week to Austel, which is considering Drummoyne Council's submission of complaint, and to Telstra, Optus and Drummoyne Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will detain the House only briefly this evening, but I feel constrained to make a few comments on the subject of this government's attitude on issues of law and order. I am well aware that they are issues that are more commonly identified with state governments. However, the federal government does have a very important role to play in the subject of law and order. I have raised more than one issue under that heading during the term of this parliament and I have never received a word of response from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very much aware that various government ministers, and probably all of them, who are concerned are acquainted with my views. I was made aware of that last Thursday when, in an interview with the radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) referred to the statements I had made on the Yakuza. These were the speeches and questions that I had raised in this place on that subject but had not directed to him. He was nevertheless aware of them. So I am satisfied that those ministers who have a responsibility for my interest in the Yakuza are aware of my views. I reiterate: none of them has ever responded to the questions I have asked in this place on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the only law and order issue that I have raised here. Recently I raised the case of the Department of Social Security refusing to cooperate with law enforcement agencies which held warrants for the arrest of felons who may be receiving social security. The department will not cooperate with law enforcement agencies on making available to those agencies information it has on the whereabouts of those people for whom warrants have been issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the Yakuza because at the end of last week the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) opened a new AFP office on the Gold Coast. He made a speech in which he referred to the Yakuza. He said that one issue which is sometimes given hysterical media treatment is the Yakuza issue. I take issue with the minister. I do not believe the treatment of the Yakuza has ever been hysterical. I believe it has been objective and quite fair. However, when governments refuse to take any notice of what is being said and genuine concerns that are being raised, naturally the press are inclined to press the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reports of Yakuza visiting casinos in every capital city in Australia have been appearing in our newspapers for some years. These reports have been confirmed by the Australian Federal Police, so the reports are neither recent nor hysterical. They have been straight out matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to put on record my concern at the minister's apparent dismissal of the subject of the activities of these people in Australia. There is plenty of evidence that, in their own way, the Yakuza are establishing themselves in Australia, not least through major property purchases. Despite the fact that it was 2 1/2 years ago that I raised the matter of the ownership of a very expensive property in Surfers Paradise by the 2IC of the biggest Yakuza gang in Japan, Masaru Takumi, he still owns that property and he is still the principal director of a company registered on the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want to be peremptory on these things but I do not think it unreasonable that a government have in place some mechanism whereby people like this can be required, in a reasonable time, to divest themselves of Australian holdings of property and companies, because without a doubt that is the foothold that the Yakuza have established wherever they have moved. The government has been warned. It has chosen not to act. </PARA>

I would like to thank him for acknowledging how widespread concern is in Victoria for the selling off of our public utilities by the Kennett government. I must say that I was saddened that the member for Casey, a fellow member of parliament for whom I have the greatest of respect, has been drawn into this debate which has been raging within my electorate of McEwen for the past six weeks.

The simple fact is that the Liberal and National parties intend to sell off all of Australia's public utilities, such as electricity, gas, water, Telecom and, without question, Australia Post. Why would you not sell Australia Post, having sold everything else?</PARA>

The Liberal and National parties in Victoria do not accept that I have that right. They are disappointed, but I will continue to ensure that they remain disappointed because I will not be muzzled by these vicious and untrue personal attacks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a lovely speech to follow. Unemployment is an issue that we are all concerned about&mdash;no more so than in the area I come from, the greater west of Sydney. I wanted to speak tonight about a program called Westjobs, which is an initiative of two area consultative committees in the area&mdash;the Central West ACC and the Outer West ACC, and both of them cover parts of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 October, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) launched Westjobs at a breakfast meeting at the Rooty Hill RSL. The target for the ACCs was to create 4,000 new jobs in the area by the end of November. The figures I got this afternoon show that 2,500 jobs have already been arranged. I am very proud of that. I am very proud of the ACCs and the hard work they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to personally congratulate the chairman of the Central West ACC, Mr Ross Jones, and the chairman of the Outer West ACC, Mr Jim Bosnjak, for the hard work they and all the members of their committees have put in. Outside their launch they had a Westjobs bus. Mr Bosnjak is the owner of Westbus, so obviously he was able to provide this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, after returning from parliament, I formally launched the separate Hawkesbury section of Westjobs in Richmond. It was a very interesting occasion because there were a number of speakers from a wide range of community groups. A local councillor, who is also a shopkeeper and the president of the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, spoke of her experience of being asked to conduct some classes in retailing at a TAFE college. She went along to the TAFE college thinking, `What am I doing here? What do these unemployed people want? Why can't they get a job? Why do they need my help?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the first night she wanted to run away and not come back because these people did not seem to understand what she was on about. As she got to know these people, she realised that they had had pride in themselves but had lost that through being unemployed and they needed a help up. She has been instrumental in that, and it has been educational for her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also heard from a trainee who was employed in a traineeship at Richmond TAFE. She talked about her experience of being trained on the job, doing TAFE courses and then being able to go into the work force into a permanent job. A lot of small business people were there, and it is the small business people who will be taking up the challenges under new work opportunities, traineeships and other programs which will eventually result in long-term permanent jobs for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot from the opposition, particularly from the shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who I am glad to see is in the chamber tonight. He constantly criticises our labour market programs and says they are useless. I have attended a number of graduations under the LEAP program&mdash;which is for young people&mdash;and this is one of the programs that he says are useless. I made a speech in an adjournment debate some time ago about a graduation in which 11 young people graduated and 10 of them had jobs before they had finished the program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the last round of the exceptional circumstance drought declarations and welcome the very belated acceptance of the B and C divisions of the Dubbo Rural Lands Protection Board into the drought relief payment scheme, which is something that should have occurred over 12 months ago. However, I must also express my disbelief and extreme frustration that other drought ravaged regions in my electorate have been yet again excluded. I refer specifically to division A of the Nyngan RLPB, which is based on Girilambone and Coolabah, large areas of the Cobar and Wilcannia boards, especially north of the Barrier Highway&mdash;these are very large areas, each of them approximating the size of Tasmania&mdash;and certain areas in the Condobolin Rural Land Protection Board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism that must be followed for areas to qualify for exceptional circumstance assistance is long and tortuous, and it would seem that it is designed to deliberately exclude many very deserving areas. This drought has been going for years now. In New South Wales, where in many instances it has been the worst drought in history, less than five per cent of total farmers are receiving any help at all. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has to make up his mind whether he wants to help these farmers or not. If he does not want to help them, he should just come out and say so, but he should not pretend that he is helping them and take credit for something that he is not delivering on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To most farmers&mdash;in fact, to most people, and I would say to most politicians&mdash;the criterion to get into the scheme is a total mystery. If you ring the minister's office for reasoning as to why some of these areas have been left out, either you get fobbed off or they say the reasons are not to be made available or you can only get them through an FOI request. It is all very secretive. Nothing about it is transparent. I know hardly anyone at all who understands the process. The farmers themselves are totally puzzled as to why some properties are in and all the neighbouring properties are out. How can a fence line make a difference, when it is obvious to anyone with half a brain that everybody in these regions is affected equally?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers feel totally cheated and forgotten. They feel that they are victims of an inequitable system and they feel abandoned. To my knowledge, the minister for primary industries and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have yet to set foot on a property in New South Wales on an official drought inspection. We have the minister for primary industries running around making claims that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars, yet he has delivered on only a very small fraction of that. When I ring his office, the only reason I am ever given is that they have had too much rain. What an insult!

The Department of Agriculture has written to the state minister. The state minister has agreed, as I understand it, and has written to the federal minister. The federal minister is still refusing, because of these criteria which no-one can understand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the opportunity&mdash;I would not call it the pleasure&mdash;to be here yesterday during some of the earlier stages of the debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. Before I go to precisely what I want to say, I wish to make some comments about the contribution from the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) who spoke for his full 20 minutes and delivered what was mainly a tirade about the federal government closing off&mdash;from the way he put it&mdash;any educational opportunity for people in remote areas. He was particularly hostile about hostels for rural school students and I want to put his comments into some context. With the program he was talking about, the changes under this piece of legislation mean that, out of a $3 billion set of programs, we are looking at a cut in a $1 million program, which was really there to provide seed funding, anyway, and a number of states have already picked up some of the recurrent funding issues there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that we had to endure that tirade. Certainly, while the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) was trying to make his contribution, he had to put up with constant haranguing from the other side from the member for Kennedy, who was saying that people were not terribly interested in rural and remote areas. I do not think that is the case in any way, shape or form, and it would be disappointing if people in the Kennedy electorate gained that impression from him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural and remote issues are very important because they are an element of what is important to the Labor Party, and that is educational opportunity across the board, regardless of where you live or, for that matter, of how much money your parents have. But I would like to concentrate what I have to say today on issues that relate to not a small number of people&mdash;certainly in terms of the Australian population&mdash;in Kennedy. The member for Kennedy talked about `one vote, one value' yesterday, and there are 80,000-odd people in his electorate, as in most other electorates; but I want to talk today about 25 per cent of the Australian population, and that is the people of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is in a very difficult position when it comes to education, because it does not have much power, in many ways, to direct where the money that we are talking about in this bill will go. We have just had reports from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training which really point out two aspects of these particular issues. One is `Resources and accountability for the Commonwealth funding for scenarios for government primary schools' for the next four years, and the other is another review into the level of Commonwealth government recurrent funding to government primary schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is very clear in these reports is also increasingly tragically evident in human terms on the ground, as far as the potential for Australian school children, and particularly Victorian school children, is concerned, and that is that the state government is ripping money out of the education system. The Commonwealth government, on the other hand, is putting it in, and what we will see will be a pipeline effect for a generation of children and young adults going through the education system in Victoria. There will be an impact which will affect their opportunities in life, and an impact which will affect the economy of that state and, therefore, of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Kennett government came to office, it has cut $400 million out of education in Victoria and closed 300 schools. The member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) is constantly trying to bring this matter up in support of his constituents, to point out the impact not only on education but also on country towns in his electorate, which is a vast one, relative to the rest of Victoria. The impact that those sorts of cuts are having on the economies of towns and, certainly, on the opportunities for children to gain proper education is astounding and, in many cases, quite demoralising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of Mr Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, has cut $400 million out of the state school system; he has closed 300 schools; and he has sacked 8,000 teachers. Now a lot of those skills have been lost to our community, probably forever. In many cases those teachers are going to New Zealand, and I will come back to that shortly. He has cut expenditure by 10 per cent, whereas the Commonwealth has increased expenditure in real terms over that same period by 1.5 per cent. So the Commonwealth has funded Victorian education through that index to pay wage increases for teachers. He has not passed them on. He has closed schools. And now the Victorian government will not even participate in the nation's literacy survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a number of contributions here yesterday from people concerned about the problems of literacy in our community, yet the Victorian government refuses to participate, along with the Western Australian government. Does that not point to something&mdash;that the Western Australian and Victorian governments refuse to participate in a national literacy survey?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was really quite surprising, considering the comments by the Liberal candidate for Jagajaga in the next election. She sent out a letter to all her would-be constituents, and she said that Victoria's truancy and literacy problems are more than a little disturbing. I have to agree with her. But she, like most Liberal candidates and members of parliament, have yet to come up with the goods; they have yet to come up with the solution. We would never see them going out and attacking Mr Kennett, who has cut $400 million, sacked teachers, increased class sizes and put incredible pressure on all elements of the school system in Victoria. They will not talk about that in terms of literacy. They will not even talk up here in the federal scene about what their alternatives are in terms of an education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be very surprised, but I would be very happy, to hear contributions from members of the National Party or the Liberal Party about what they are going to do as an alternative. It is no use just coming in here; it is getting a bit late for that. The clock is ticking away out there in the electorate. They might think they are having a good run now, feeling pretty pumped up, but, once the heat goes on, they have to put those policies out there some time. The later it is, the harder it is going to be to sell them. But the problem is that they will not be able to sell them because people do not believe anyone who has gone on for so long hiding policies from them, particularly when they can see what Liberal-National Party governments do when they are in office. They cut health and they cut education, and certainly in so many ways we have seen that happen now. Not only do they cut it; they take resources out of the system in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems for the federal government is to get accountability in health, education or any of these joint Commonwealth-state programs, any of these areas where money is allocated for specific purposes into state government programs. Education is one of the most critical areas. Health is obviously very important but, when it comes to education, we are talking about the future. It is very hard to rectify these discrepancies and these weaknesses in an education system for generations to come. It has an incredible pipeline effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are any dollars that a government, state or federal, is going to spend out of revenue from taxpayers, then surely education is one of the most critical areas of government expenditure. It has an impact on so many things. It has an impact on our economy, and it has an impact on our society in ways that often cannot be measured but, in many ways, can be measured with great precision. It has an impact on the opportunities that people have, the ability for our most valuable resource&mdash;our human resource&mdash;to be provided with the skills, the ingenuity and innovation to contribute to the economic wealth and growth of this country. Yet we see that conservative state governments, time after time, cut education, push down wages and bring in incredibly restrictive workplace arrangements and legislation&mdash;as we have seen in Western Australia only too recently. At the same time, they find all these ways to reduce their accountability so that they siphon off the Commonwealth dollars which are there for specific purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has a number of quite clear objectives in education which give opportunities for people to maximise our human and economic resources. The Commonwealth's objective is to strengthen Australian schools by assisting schools to provide educational services of the highest quality, to prepare students for life in general and for full participation in society, including participation in a skill, to create an adaptable work force, to promote equity within schools and society&mdash;we do not hear much of that from the others&mdash;and to maximise retention rates, especially among groups which currently have low rates of retention. One of the great successes of the government over the last decade has been the way in which we have been able to build that retention rate from one of the lowest in the OECD to one of the highest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just the other day I was sending out best wishes and kits to the school leavers finishing year 12 in my electorate. When I started doing this eight or nine years ago, I had plenty left over after having distributed 500. This year I have distributed over 1,500. That shows the success of the government's policies and expenditure in building up retention rates so that our young people go through to the end of year 12 and get the maximum opportunity to participate in TAFE or further education, or even just to go from there and take a break to learn some life skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's programs are also there, particularly in primary school funding, to facilitate the transition from primary to secondary school. We have seen even greater advances in facilitating the transition from secondary school to further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw a few parallels. I have said a few things about the federal government's money being spirited away by Liberal-National Party state governments in places like Victoria&mdash;they are not the only ones&mdash;where we have seen $400 million being sucked out of the system, 8,000 teachers being sacked and the Commonwealth's real increase in expenditure in schools education being undercut and knocked down by the incredibly drastic 10 per cent expenditure cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the ideal that is held up by those opposite about the wonderful land of the long white cloud. The student-teacher ratio in primary schools in New Zealand in 1993 was about 25.5 to one; in Australia the ratio is 18.4 to one. In secondary schools in New Zealand the ratio was 17.5 to one; in Australia the ratio is 12.4 to one. New Zealand has not invested long-term expenditure in training teachers and now they are importing teachers from Australia. Talk about a brain-drain! Think of the dollars we have spent developing the skills of Australian teachers. Now New Zealand is trying to suck teachers out of Australia&mdash;all too willingly provided by the likes of Jeff Kennett&mdash;to go over there. That is a great loss to our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at how the conservative government in New Zealand has failed its people. It is no wonder they have some economic success, but at what cost? Sure, it is easy to be the cheap, white trash of Asia if we want to have people with a low standard of education working in factories at absolutely minimum wages, which is the sort of thing that is being promoted by those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proportion of all students in New Zealand who stayed on to form 7&mdash;the equivalent of year 12 in Australia&mdash;increased from approximately 15 per cent in 1980 to more than 50 per cent in 1993. From 15 per cent through to 50 per cent is one thing, but between 1990 and 1993 the number of students who completed form 7 increased from 33 per cent to 38 per cent. The equivalent school retention rate for year 12 in Australia in 1993 was 76.6 per cent, up from 71.3 per cent in 1991. That is a big difference. Some of the economic commentators who only think of the short term might think that there have been some great successes over there, but at what price? What price is New Zealand society paying for such poor performance in education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will be the price to Australian society&mdash;and we will see the effects in a very short time&mdash;of pulling $400 million from the Victorian education system? The Minister for Education has been absolutely abysmal in his public relations and in his performance in Victoria. He pulls out $400 million and then a couple of weeks back he makes a big announcement about how he is putting $50 million back in. The principals to whom I have spoken&mdash;and there are still a few who are game enough and brave enough to talk to people outside of the Liberal Party in Victoria&mdash;do not cop that. The school communities do not cop that. Those school communities have been asked to take the cuts and to go out into the poorest areas and find hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep their schools running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free education is an absolute myth in Victoria. It is okay for the people who live in rich and wealthy suburbs where their kids go to government schools. They have all of the professional people, and that is where all of the big fundraising and sponsorship goes on. That is what they call `schools of the future' in Victoria&mdash;if you have got the money, if you have got the clout, you will do okay. But where is the support for the schools in the low income areas such as the West Heidelbergs of the world? What hope have the kids in those areas got? The state government does not care; it is quite happy for people to be in that situation. The people there are either unemployed and live on social security paid for by the federal government or they are used, under the Victorian industrial relations system, as cheap factory fodder. And, for that matter, if the opposition should ever come to power in this country, federally, we would have deeply repressive national industrial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that education is something that has to be improved on in terms of our federal system and in terms of accountability. One of the basics of that is literacy. It is about time that the Victorian government stopped talking about the schools of the future and started investing in the schools of the here and now. Without developing and participating in national literacy surveys, and without putting real money into education, Victoria will go backwards. We have the opportunity to go forward now. Manufacturing and many other aspects of the Victorian economy are starting to move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had to undergo, probably more than any other state in Australia, the most drastic restructure to get our economies and our industries&mdash;so many of which are manufacturing based&mdash;away from protection and from the old ways. The Victorian people have done that. They have done it hard, but they have survived. They have built new industries. But now they are having to pay another price for their efforts, by having their children ostracised in this process of vast cuts and, indeed, by the lack of accountability between federal and state funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one big issue facing Australia as it goes into the 21st century is not about the flag or whether we have a President or a Queen, and all the rest of it; it is about federal-state relationships. What sort of country are we going to have? Is it going to be one that is a collection of 19th century colonies, as those opposite would have it, inhabiting a big continent, having a common currency and interstate trade policies and a common defence? Or is it going to be one where there is true national progress, where the states and the Commonwealth work out, through constitutional reform, the realities and get some consistency? It is about time that some of the people in state governments woke up, instead of harbouring a parochial small-minded attitude about their hangovers from the 19th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we seen from the opposition? We see them going back to state taxes and the same old ways of promoting the states at the expense of national Australian policy. You cannot talk about an Australian flag unless you have an Australian attitude. I am afraid that national attitude is seriously lacking in the opposition. They are at the behest of their state Liberal and National party organisations, and this is reflected in their very parochial attitudes. There has to be accountability for federal grants to the states. On this occasion the federal government's money will be spent to overcome the deficiencies of state governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been interested and amused by the statement by the member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples). His remarks, which went way beyond the scope of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, indicated that this is a very wide ranging debate. The only thing he did not mention is the need for more priority funding for the Pacific Highway. I am surprised he did not do that, because I know he would share my views on that particular point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested to hear the previous speaker mention that the issues of the flag and republic are not the major issues confronting Australia today, or in the future beyond the next election. I was surprised that he should focus on federal-state relationships as the major issue facing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the major issue facing Australia as unemployment&mdash;jobs and future security for all Australians. That should be the absolute priority. I take this opportunity to refute the furphy raised by the honourable member for Jagajaga when he was talking about the opposition advocating state taxes. This is not true. In the lead-up to the election campaign the government will continue to put forward falsehoods, which will have to be hit on the head every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of fairness the government has to be applauded for its funding of the programs in this legislation&mdash;for instance, the extension of the early literacy program to 1996. Literacy is a major problem right around this country. I do not believe that most Australians realise the extent of the literacy problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will provide grants to foster literacy development for children in their early years of schooling. Next year, government schools right around Australia will receive $6.666 million, while non-government schools will receive $2.208 million. The idea of the program is great, but the level of funding is ridiculous&mdash;it is farcical. If the government were fair dinkum, they would be spending far more than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to talk about the need for literacy, we should certainly pinpoint our Aboriginal community, and perhaps the Torres Strait Islanders as well. Next week, as part of the inquiry currently being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I will be chairing hearings at Ernabella and Nepabunna. The committee has been to many places around Australia. You cannot help but be appalled at the extraordinarily high level of illiteracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is the key to the future of Aboriginal Australians. I believe that education has failed Aboriginal Australia. In my capacity as deputy chairman of the committee I speak to many Aboriginal people, not only in my own electorate but right around Australia, and it is horrifying to find the level of illiteracy. Without literacy and without education those people are doomed. I applaud the government for what they are doing, but it is too little too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another budget initiative reflected in the bill is the new program of grants to non-government special schools, to assist students with disabilities to make the transition to mainstream education or to pursue further training for employment. Again, that is wonderful and I applaud it. But how much are we providing for the whole of Australia? It is $3.22 million. This is only window-dressing; the scope of the problem is far wider. Three million dollars right around Australia for a whole year's program is quite laughable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also perturbed that the government is going to do away with the gifted and talented children's program. Let us face it, if we take as an example the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, he continually spoke about the clever country. We do need to be a clever country. I believe we need to foster and give support to gifted, clever, talented kids. This is a resource we cannot afford to waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that we spend a very large amount of money on children with disabilities, and I do not begrudge one cent of that expenditure, I think it is absolutely vital that we do that, but we are very short-sighted because, while we are spending a great deal of money to help those who have some sort of a disability, we are now walking away from the gifted and the talented children. If we are to be a clever country, if we are to succeed and increase our productivity and make our economy more efficient, then we need all the brains we can get. We need to foster and help clever, talented people. I think it is a great pity that they are doing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the cutback of funding for hostels for rural school students. My area, which is the mid-north coast of New South Wales, is not remote but there are remote areas around Australia where, without a hostel, kids cannot get education at all. I find it very strange that speaker after speaker from the government can stand up and talk about equity and fairness and bucket us in the opposition as though we do not care and as though they are the owners of all caring and all compassion. It is not true. Then you come to the reality of the situation. It is not a great deal of money that they are talking about but it is just one more thing that is going to make it harder for those kids who live in isolated areas to get a decent education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying about our Aboriginal Australians, education is the key. It is the key for everybody. A good education is needed, particularly these days. It might have been the case that decades ago you could make it on your own, but not these days. I will give you one example of a person who did make it on his own several decades ago. Ulrich Ellis, who worked in this parliament as principal private secretary to Sir Earle Page, Fadden and McEwen and who was later campaign director for the New England New State Movement&mdash;a wonderful man and author of several books&mdash;failed the Intermediate examination. That was his proud claim. He was a brilliant man who was successful and did make it without a formal education. However, that is not possible these days and unless we provide education for all of our people we are doing a great disservice to every individual. Without an education they just cannot enjoy life to the fullest, and literacy is the key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the first point I was making and that is the paucity of funding being provided for the literacy program. I wish that more could be provided. I know, as everybody else does, that Australia is broke after 13 years of financial administration by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Look at the balance of payments problem and all the other factors. I will not go into them now. Australia is broke. It is like when the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was Minister for Land Transport and I would always be talking about the Pacific Highway and asking for more funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as I am now and will continue to do. You have to realise that you have to balance things up and set priorities. Literacy education has to be an absolute priority. Unless we are concerned enough and care enough to make the commitment, then we are going to go out backwards. We cannot just rely on the enormous number of dedicated and committed people who are involved in our schools as teachers or administrators or even the parents and friends bodies that do such an absolutely marvellous job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I get a lot of schools coming from my electorate to visit Parliament House and I make a point of spending a lot of time with them. It is a truism, of course, to say that those kids are the future of Australia, but they are. Even if they are coming down on non-sitting weeks, if I possibly can I will come down especially and meet the kids when they come in. I will have them for two or three hours and bash their ears about democracy&mdash;I use that phrase, which always amuses them&mdash;and about the importance of parliament and the great things that we have in this country. We take democracy for granted&mdash;we really do. There is only a handful of countries, 20 or 25, where anyone can get out and do what I do in every federal election campaign, which is to stand on the street corners with a microphone and say what I think quite freely about parliament and government, with no secret police across the street and nobody with a submachine gun around the corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say to the kids, you just have to look at your television screen any night of the week to see what is going on elsewhere and realise how lucky we are to be in this country&mdash;even though it does have a Labor government&mdash;and to enjoy the facilities of freedom and liberty and democracy that do not exist in most countries in the world. Those teachers who come down here, sometimes with 70, 80 or even 150 kids, and give their time, at night and in travelling with them, do a wonderful job. In the context of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 I would like to pay tribute to those teachers who are involved with those schools coming down. They do a fantastic job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the government schools; the private schools that I have in my electorate do a wonderful job. They do not all manage to get down here. For instance, I have three Seventh Day Adventist primary schools&mdash;at Coffs Harbour, Kempsey and Macksville&mdash;who do a great job and they generally combine with some others to come down. Mirriwinni Gardens Aboriginal Academy&mdash;right up at Nulla Creek, where Slim Dusty was born, on the upper Macleay&mdash;is doing a great job with Aboriginal kids, not just from our area but from all over Australia. We have two Rudolf Steiner schools&mdash;Chrysalis, which is a secondary as well as a primary school, and Casuarina&mdash;which are doing a good job and providing the variation in education that is so important to give people the option of having something different. And, of course, the Catholic school system does an absolutely fantastic job, both in primary and secondary schools. Without that, the impact on state governments in providing education would be unbelievable. It is absolutely essential that that system is supported and continues; otherwise, if it were to disappear, the stresses placed on state government systems would be totally insupportable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of smaller schools. It is interesting that they seem to be proliferating and expressing various views, particularly in the Christian schools. We have a new Anglican school in Coffs Harbour, Bishop Druitt College, and at Kempsey there is the very small Heritage Christian School. There are also the Christian community schools. We have an excellent high school at Bonville, near Coffs Harbour, and two branches of the Christian community school in the primary area&mdash;one in Coffs Harbour and one at Nambucca Heads. These people are doing a wonderful job as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are even quite small schools, such as the Coffs Harbour Bible Christian School. The last time I was there it had only 19 students, so it is very tiny. But they have the freedom in this country to do their own thing and I think that is very important indeed. Another of these is the Tallowood School at Bellingen, and so it goes on. All of these schools are doing a wonderful job, but all are in need of a little more funding. To come back to my main thrust, we have to acknowledge, we have to realise, that without education this country cannot go anywhere and we have to place the emphasis on education for every kid in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the member for Jagajaga was suggesting that, in Victoria, the schools in poorer socioeconomic areas were disadvantaged compared to those in richer areas. If so, it is a great pity. I suppose that, if their average level of income is higher, the support for the school from the parents is likely to be higher as well. But I understand what he is saying, because the electorate of Cowper has the second lowest level of per capita income of any federal electorate in Australia. We, in Cowper, are not rich people. We have got an enormous number of unemployed. The last figures were somewhere about 18 to 19 per cent. It becomes 15 to 24 per cent in the 30s, and teenage unemployment is over 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures are from the last time we got the figures.

I want to emphasise the point that, in my electorate, we have a number of disadvantaged schools. I am not conversant with the Victorian system, but in the New South Wales system the disadvantaged school system does work. They are provided with extra facilities and extra funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, my electorate is not remote in any normal sense. But there are one or two schools right in the backwoods, so to speak. Collombatti Rail is a very tiny school in the Macleay Valley, but it is well equipped with computers and all sorts of equipment. This I applaud. At least in the New South Wales school system&mdash;at present, at least&mdash;there is some fairness and there is some equity. If Victoria is not employing the same form of system for disadvantaged schools, I hope that Victoria will see what New South Wales is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I come back to the main theme that without education we hamstring our young people. This is why, as I said at the beginning, I applaud the government for introducing these things. But the level of funding is really joke. It is just not satisfactory at all. Of course, literacy and numeracy&mdash;this is simple and basic&mdash;are the key. I will go back to the point I made at the beginning: under $9 million for government and non-government schools throughout Australia, for the whole of 1996, really is a joke. I want to conclude by saying that every dollar we spend on educating our kids and every dollar we spend on educating older Australians is a dollar well spent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important bill. It brings into force some of the government's initiatives. I was particularly impressed with the idea of the extension of the early literacy program. This should be called the Mary Crawford amendment. If I remember rightly, the member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training did a lot of work on literacy and numeracy. They produced an excellent report. I am certain the recommendations in that report have influenced the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) to give more money to this particular area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian state government has cut funding to kindergartens by $11.5 million or 18 per cent. That has happened since the beginning of 1994. What does cutting funding to kindergartens do? It is estimated that the fees have risen from $40 in 1993 to between $100 and $120 in 1995. In one particular kindergarten, enrolments have fallen from around 94 per cent to about 88 per cent. That is the sort of thing that is happening all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aspendale North Kindergarten has recently complained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> about what is happening. Aspendale North is close to my electorate, although it is in the electorate of Isaacs. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kay Cafarella is the parents' committee member in charge of enrolments and fees at Aspendale North Kindergarten. She said yesterday that the kindergarten's committee had done everything it could to keep fees down, but has still had to raise them from $35 a term before the cuts to $90 in 1994, and $105 this year and $110 next year.</PARA>
<PARA>Jeffrey Kennett is putting this huge impost on average families in Victoria. He is making the parents pay these huge fees at the very beginning of their children's education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this do? The people who can afford it&mdash;the wealthy people in our community&mdash;have no problems paying this sort of fee. However, those who have low incomes, such as single mums and others, cannot afford it, and so their kids miss out on those first years at kindergarten, years which are vitally important for the whole of their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which did an inquiry into bullying in schools. We had evidence before us that was given by kindergarten teachers that this sort of behaviour could be noted when the kids had just started kindergarten. What happens? Once again, for those who cannot afford to send their kids to kindergarten, these faults cannot be rectified and they cannot get those extra couple of years education which really assist. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 23 October 1995 revealed that hundreds of children have dropped out of kindergarten halfway through the year because parents cannot afford to keep paying their up-front fees. As I said before, thousands of children in Victoria are being affected because of the impost that Jeffrey Kennett has put on those kindergartens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to primary schools. I had a mother speaking to me yesterday and she was complaining that at her child's school, a school in Frankston, they have composite grades of grades 4, 5 and 6. They do not have just one composite grade of 4, 5 and 6; they have three composite grades of 4, 5 and 6, and there are 30 kids in each grade. I said, `Why can't they be separated into three grades, one 4, one 5 and one 6?' She said, `At the present time, they can't do it because there will be more boys in one class than there should be.' That is because of some ludicrous law that is under way in Victoria. Children in grade 6 who are ready to go into high school or whatever they call it now, secondary school or tech school, have got younger kids of grade 4 in their actual class, so naturally they do not get the proper training. This is what is happening to schooling in Victoria, and it is all over Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a look at what else is happening there, it is not just the children that are being affected; it is also the teachers that are being affected. Teacher numbers in Victoria have been cut tremendously. If the teachers speak out against it, what happens? I will tell you what happens. Mr Kennett commented on the radio that teachers unhappy with the education system should get another job. `They use our children as ramming rods to prove they have their own points, so I have no truck with them at all,' Mr Kennett told 3AW. `I do not see why we should promote teachers who have a record of disruption or withdrawing services.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what else is happening in Victoria. The Kennett government have taken $400 million out of education already. That is August 1995, so it is not as if it is going back. They have removed $400 million and they are about to take out another $150 million. We are giving them more money. They are stealing the money and putting it somewhere else. Who knows where it is going. Jeffrey Kennett spent $50 million refurbishing various government buildings. His own offices are like a fortress&mdash;you cannot get in there. Supposedly the carpet is about three inches thick. This is the sort of thing the money is going to. It has been taken out of the education funding that the federal government is giving and is going to the contracts of his friends or his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at what is happening in Victoria in relation to education and to the casinos. All Jeffrey's mates get whatever they want down there. If they want another casino table, it is a case of, `No worries; here you are, Mr Williams.' If you are a friend of the Liberal Party and if you make a big donation or if you look after his house, maintain the lawns or do a bit of building there, you get what you want. However, if you want to get your kids into schools, there is a bit of a queue. There are 30 in a classroom. There are 271 primary and secondary schools that have been closed in Victoria under the Kennett government. There are 8,200 teachers who have been taken out of the system. Is that doing the education of our children any good? Certainly not. Victoria spends $1,004 per person on education in comparison with New South Wales, which spends $1,108 per person on education. There are similar sorts of figures in social security, housing and recreation, and we can go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that New South Wales spends about $300 more than Victoria does per primary and secondary school pupil. Jeffrey Kennett has a committee made up of politicians from his own joint party, and even that committee has criticised what he has done in education. The report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The school global budget in Victoria</EMPHASIS>. The report has been circulating amongst school principals for quite some time now. One of its recommendations was that there was a `strong argument for increasing the overall level of resources for primary schools'. It said that it was time to end the funding disparity between primary and secondary schools and that there was a need for a significant increase in resources for students with special learning needs. It also recommended assistance to small schools in country areas so that they can offer a broader range of studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, because of these cuts&mdash;for instance, the special teachers have been sacked&mdash;and the increases in numbers, the state's VCE rates have dropped. The numbers of students staying at government secondary schools has fallen every year since 1992. When was Jeffrey elected? According to figures released by the state government last night, current VCE retention rates were measured at 77.5 per cent in February this year, with a low of 70.6 per cent in July. In February 1992, the retention rate was 84.6 per cent, and in February 1995 it is 77.3 per cent. </PARA>

It said that the Liberal Party has the policies, the team and the determination in Victoria to get Victoria moving in the right direction. He certainly moved it to the right all right. As I said before, he has destroyed democracy in Victoria. He sacks any teacher who speaks out. If the Liberal Party gets elected again and if Jeffrey becomes the dictator of Victoria, I will probably be up against the wall. However, I will not go there quietly. </PARA>

In this bill we see that the federal government is going to honour promises on three-year funding that it made prior to the last federal election. I particularly want to focus on the abolition of a rural hostels program. The bill seeks to implement the announcement in the 1995-96 budget that this program would cease in July 1995. So much for the rhetoric about the federal government knowing and understanding the problems out there in rural Australia.

I have been personally involved with the committees which run those hostels, and I have seen the good work and the worth of the program. It was only this year that the Roma Rural Student Hostel received funding of almost $6,000 from this program, for the purchase of a computer, a laser printer, computer software, staff computer training and advertising. It is a very worthwhile program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am here today, I want to put on the public record my support for this program. Unfortunately, it is not going to run its full life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May of this year the  program provided $1,508 for St Joseph's hostel in Dalby, another rural hostel doing a wonderful job providing accommodation for rural students so that they can gain access to higher education. Those hostels are playing a particularly important role in providing that accommodation for those students.

Those amounts of money are extremely modest when you consider the total amount of money that is spent on the education budget. For the people of Bollon at the hostel there, $1,508 has bought some assistance and facilities which would otherwise not have been provided. Of course, the local community was unable to provide it, given the severe recession still out there in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absence of this funding will place a severe financial burden on these hostel committees and their local communities in the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abolition of the rural hostel program will only exacerbate this inequity, and I condemn the federal government for attacking the people and families of rural Australia by failing to continue to fund that hostel program for the life of the original commitment made by the government. It is a particularly callous breach of promise to the people of rural Australia, given the plight of so many families as a result of five long hard years of drought and of what can only be described as the recession that still plagues rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on some comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) in relation to education. He attacked me recently in the Senate about my comments in the rural newspapers of Queensland regarding access to Austudy. These articles stated that farmers had come to see me and said that they would be better off, in many cases, if they did not receive some of the available assistance measures. While that assistance is welcome at the time, when they later go to their accountants, farmers are finding that, in many cases, their entitlement to other assistance measures such as Austudy have been severely cut. Some farmers now actually have a debt to repay to the Department of Employment, Education and Training because they were not entitled to the Austudy that their children had received. This is due to income in the form of assistance that they could not have predicted would be available when they originally applied for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to what Senator Bob Collins said in the upper house, because he seemed to think it was a bit of a joke. My comments in the newspaper were in response to representations from farmers out there at the coalface; they were comments representative of the views of people out in rural Australia. Senator Collins was criticising me for saying that assistance arrangements for farmers makes it difficult to predict their income for the year ahead. He was trying to defend these arrangements. It is difficult for farmers to estimate their income, and this is one of the difficulties which people from rural Australia have in applying for Austudy, because to predict their income&mdash;and the seasons, as well&mdash;is virtually impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the schemes that is certainly providing much needed help to many farmers in rural Australia is the rural adjustment package, but it is really just a lottery. Minister Bob Collins obviously does not understand that the income that farmers receive&mdash;whether from a drought relief payment or as an interest subsidy&mdash;goes towards their family's taxable income for that year. I have got a farmer's budget figures here, but before I read those into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> I wish to state that in the last 13 months the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority has received 5,994 applications for assistance. If you are one of those farmers out there applying for assistance, you really do not know whether you are going to get it and how much you might be going to get. Of those applicants, 4,826 were successful and 1,168 were not successful, so it becomes an absolute lottery to know whether you are or are not going to get that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A farmer came to see me recently about this problem, and I actually have in front of me his family budget: that is how concerned he is about the issue&mdash;unlike Senator Collins, who thinks it is a joke. This farmer applied for an interest subsidy and he thought that it was right to assume that he would probably get an amount similar to his entitlement in previous years. The drought worsened and the Rural Adjustment Authority looked at his application and realised that, unless he got substantially more assistance, he was a possible risk of foreclosure. The authority recognised his plight, caused by five years of long hard drought and a mouse plague in the area, so he received almost double the level of assistance provided the year before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That farmer had budgeted for a figure of about $11,000 in assistance. I will not read out the figure that he actually received, but it was double his budgeted figure and a bit more. At the end of the financial year when Austudy did a review of his need for Austudy assistance, it found that his dependent children were not entitled to full Austudy, because that assistance was treated as family income. This meant that those children were tripped out of the top level of Austudy. As a result of an assistance measure, the farmer has now to repay some $10,000 in Austudy that has been paid to the students. It was welcome assistance but it has tripped them out of the top level of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister said that the assistance meant that predicting the farmer's income for the year was difficult, there was laughter in the Senate chamber. Of course it is difficult, and it is even difficult to predict when you are or are not going to get financial assistance in the form of an interest subsidy. The figure of 1,168 farmers who missed out on the subsidy clearly indicates that some get it and some do not. Those who get it cannot budget for it in the financial year, because they do not know whether they are going to get it or how much it might be. In this case, receiving it meant that the farmer's income was higher than he had predicted on the application for Austudy assistance and so, at the end of the financial year, he found that he then had a debt to repay. Whilst the assistance is certainly welcomed by farmers, the complex and uncertain way of receiving it is creating a downside for the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Bob Collins went on to say that farm families receiving a drought relief payment&mdash;which is another form of assistance and is all about putting food on the table for these families&mdash;are excluded from the Austudy assets and income test for the time they are on drought relief payments; that is, for the period of the drought and for a further six months following that. That is true; but, if families are not on drought relief payments for the financial year 1995-96 and they apply for Austudy this financial year, whilst they may have been on Austudy in the previous financial year, that drought relief payment is considered&mdash;in terms of their access to, or eligibility for, Austudy&mdash;as income for the previous financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the farmer is on the drought relief payment, that is fine; but, if he trips out of it because of the arrival of a welcome, come-by-chance crop, the farmer then goes off drought relief payment. This is because, if he is not entitled to it, he is going to have to pay it back, as he has to in the similar case of Austudy. This particular farmer actually took his family off the drought relief payment because he realised that he was not entitled to it. With the failure of the winter crop, he then reapplied in the next financial year and, because he was not on drought relief payments, the Austudy income and assets test did apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case demonstrates how little the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy knows&mdash;or cares, for that matter&mdash;about this issue, because he seemed to make a bit of a joke of it in the upper house. But I do understand the issue, because I am representing these people on a day-to-day basis. I do not think there has been anywhere in Australia in the last 30 or 40 years a drought area worse than we have seen in the Darling Downs and south-west Queensland. Unfortunately, the drought has come on top of the collapse of the wool price and the corruption of the international commodity market for grain, and it has come on the back of the highest interest rates that this country has ever seen. Farm after farm is in a desperate situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these assistance measures have been welcomed by the farmers, they also create other consequences and problems down the track. Farmers cannot accurately predict their income or the source of any financial assistance that may be coming from the Commonwealth and, because of that, we see that the consequences of providing assistance to the rural sector, particularly Austudy, are not understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister ought to think again before he says this issue is a joke. The fact that he took the time of the Senate to attack me on this issue shows quite clearly that my comments are hurting him. They are accurate comments which have come from farmers of my constituency. They are also comments that are supported by accountants who do the books for these people. These people have presented their farm budgets to me. They have also shown me the amount of assistance they are receiving. One thing about rural people is that they never like to talk about the amount of debt they have or the amount of tax they pay. They are very private people. They have had to swallow an enormous amount of pride to show me exactly what they have received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must condemn the actions of the federal government in breaking a promise in not continuing to assist those rural hostels to the tune of another $1.1 million for just one more year. I would have thought the minister would have looked again at this issue. Students are part of the next generation of people to live in rural Australia. They are the beneficiaries of the rural hostels program, which has been well received and has delivered some wonderful facilities to students who would not otherwise have been provided for. Obviously, the minister has been rolled by the Treasury officials, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the cabinet. He obviously has very little authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it demonstrates that the Labor Party has no understanding of the plight of rural communities in Australia. The Labor Party always thinks, `If we throw a bit of money out there they'll keep quiet, they'll be happy.' They do not understand the complexities of budgeting in rural Australia and the complexities of rural economies. They certainly do not represent the best interests of the students of rural Australia. The abolition of the rural hostels program one year prior to when it was meant to conclude in this funding round demonstrates that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join the debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 because it gives us an opportunity to develop an important theme that is now before the politic national, that is, Commonwealth-state relations. Education&mdash;especially primary and secondary education&mdash;is a field where the responsibility is shared between the states and the Commonwealth government. It is interesting to have a look at the way in which that cooperation takes place in various states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of my Victorian colleagues have spoken on this side of the house. In Victoria we are seeing some of the worst aspects of Commonwealth-state relations where there is an unequal sharing of the responsibilities. It is in primary and secondary education in Victoria&mdash;amongst other things such as hospitals&mdash;where we see that because the states are given the greater power they reach outcomes that are not in the best interests of the people who live in the state and do not fulfil the outcomes that the federal government would like to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in this bill first came about because I noted that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), in his second reading speech, provided supplementation of capital and recurrent grants to reflect movements in costs. One of the things that has galled me in Victoria is that there is very little recognition, especially towards capital works, of the Commonwealth's contribution to projects in government schools. In fact, the Kennett government, in using capital works in education as part of its grand plan to get infrastructure spending and capital works projects on the go, completely ignores the contribution that is made by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Minister Free has endeavoured, with great gusto, to ensure that the states&mdash;in this case, the state of Victoria&mdash;understand their obligations under the various Commonwealth-state agreements, still at the edges the Victorian government tends to try to slink through and not acknowledge at any point, in what it is doing, how much contribution is made to capital works projects. For instance, in the development of the Mill Park Secondary College, which is the only post-primary school in a suburb that now has 30,000 residents, and is growing at a great rate of knots, something like $4,445,000 of the capital money used to build that school was federal money, was Commonwealth money. As each stage is developed and each stage opens, whether it is informally or formally, there is very little recognition&mdash;very little to no recognition&mdash;of the contributions that are made by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that we really need to look at, because the people of Victoria need to understand that, despite Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett&mdash;as the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) so often refers to him&mdash;making glib comments about the nature of Commonwealth-state relations, a lot of income tax moneys that are raised are returned to the state. In some way the Premier thinks that he is a great national figure and he has the interests of the nation at heart, but we had him yesterday coming up with this notion, in commenting on the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about a referendum on whether the states should be able to raise income taxes or not, of suggesting that, I think, 80 per cent of all income tax and company tax should just be handed over to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in an adjournment speech earlier this week, I do not think that the people of Victoria would welcome a suggestion that we are going to give even more power to a Premier such as Jeff Kennett. It is just not on. At the worst, they might believe that there needs to be this balancing between what we, as a national government, have as objectives as against what Kennett has as his objectives for his state government. At best, I suppose, I would like to believe that we, as a national government, can work in the national interests, which are also in the states' interests. I reject this notion that somehow, as we approach the centenary of Federation, we should revert back to Australia being still a collection of six colonies. This is nonsense. As we develop a maturity on the international scene, as we understand the need for us all to work together, we really need to act as one nation. If the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) mentions the importance of the Pacific Highway, that is done in a context that it is not only important to his local electorate but important on the national scene.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at a government education system, whether it be in Victoria, Western Australia, New South Wales or wherever, we have to remember that what happens in that education system will have a definite impact on what is happening to Australia as a nation. That is an important consideration, and it is disappointing to hear, through the comments that have been made by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello) and by a state Liberal Premier in Kennett, that the coalition is unclear in what it would have for the nation with respect to Commonwealth-state relations. I unashamedly believe that we should be moving towards national policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about national policies, it does not necessarily mean that we are talking about centralist policies. We have to recognise that, in a country the size of Australia, state authorities and local authorities have a role to play. They are perhaps better placed in the delivery process, and in that delivery they should be working to a national framework. As I said, I cannot understand why the Victorian government, in its mealy-mouthed way, will not recognise the contribution that is made towards capital works projects in government schools. I contrast that with the attitude of non-government schools, schools in the Catholic system or schools that are run by other organisations. When they join in an agreement with the Commonwealth government about the capital funding of their project, they are quite happy to fulfil the requests that are made of them. In my electorate, when we had the opening of things that we have made contributions to in the Catholic system, they are quite happy to recognise the involvement of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this week, in an adjournment speech&mdash;and I am sorry the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has gone&mdash;I raised what I thought was a genuine concern that should interest the House about the Better Cities project. One element of the Better Cities project in my electorate is that some surplus institutional land, which was used as a psychiatric institution, has now become available for housing development. In setting up a proper community approach to this housing development, a number of state departments, local agencies, the Urban Land Authority and others have got together to work up models of what should be included in this development. Unfortunately, the one state administration that is not cooperating properly is the school education division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the corner of this site is the Bundoora Primary School, which has, I think, been there for over a hundred years. Slowly but surely development has impinged upon its site. On one boundary we have a six-lane road with the light rail&mdash;the tram that was built with money from the Better Cities project&mdash;running down the middle of it. This main road serves the suburb of Mill Park. On the other boundary of the school, we have part of the western ring road, the link to Greensborough, so it has a major road on either side of it. Over a number of years, this school has endeavoured to get the department's agreement to find an alternative site for it. The school basically services the suburb of Bundoora. It has a definite catchment which was widened two years ago when a neighbouring primary school was closed, under the Kennett government's unilateral closure of schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it has been offered is a site which services one of the housing developments in the suburb of Mill Park. There is nothing wrong with the site, but what the department does not seem to understand&mdash;I just wonder whether they are ensconced in Nauru House or some other ivory tower&mdash;is what is happening at a community level. If they are suggesting that this local school should move to that site, what they are saying is that the existing school closes and they build a new school. If that is the decision that they have come to, that is the way they should package it; they should not gloss it up in any other manner. The importance of the Better Cities land is that the present Bundoora Primary School is in the corner of that land. A proper housing residential development would give consideration to whether there was a need to have a primary school on it. On the basis of the number of residential allotments it is possible, and I believe quite probable, that there should be a school within this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, DSE, the appropriate state authority, will not even enter into discussions to have that kept open, as a suggestion. At a public meeting that was held at the Bundoora Primary School, one of the officials said, inter alia, that they would not be told by anybody where they were going to put their schools. This is a disgraceful and unfortunate attitude. As I have said in letters to the Bundoora Primary School community, at the end of the day wherever the new school is to go is probably not the question at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am asking is that the members of the school community have all the facts before them so that they can have a considered view about where the possible new school would go. What it is about is whether it should be a relocation of Bundoora Primary School&mdash;that is, a true relocation where they could move to a site that might be half a kilometre or a kilometre away&mdash;or, as I described before, whether it should be closure of the school and the building of a school some four or five kilometres up the road which would serve a totally different catchment area. I accept that these decisions need to be made from time to time, because the demographics of the areas in which schools operate change. It is not simply because Bundoora Primary School has been there for, I believe, over a century. It is not just a historical basis that justifies the school continuing; it is proper planning that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been an opportunity for a number of my colleagues to quite rightly express their disquiet, through to disgust&mdash;wherever they fit on that sort of scale&mdash;about what is happening with education in Victoria. Some $400 million has been ripped out of the budget; there has been the closure of some 300 schools; there is the loss of some 8,000 teaching positions; and there is the move towards different managerial styles that have been, unfortunately, instituted overnight with very little regard for the school communities and the school councils to be able to absorb that change. That is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem with school councils having a greater say in the way in which their schools operate. I think that is proper. But when we do that, when we devolve to school communities greater decision making, we have to recognise that they need to be given the support in making those decisions. That is where the inequity between what we would describe as disadvantaged areas and advantaged areas is even worsened, because it is not just economic inequities, it is also skills inequities. It is all right in suburbs where we have people that are managers in their own right and understand the complexities that are placed upon and by the bureaucrats within the education department. It is not all right where people are doing this out of concern, a desire to assist in the proper education of their children, where they are being exposed to new notions and it is done without proper support and training. That is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bleak picture in Victoria. I want to mention two articles in the Melbourne papers this morning. One article mentions that the state Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education visited a school for the opening of a room that had been destroyed by fire. The room has been replaced by using insurance money. I believe that, after a considered view&mdash;and probably quite rightly&mdash;a number of teachers went to the gateway in protest at this visit. Whilst the teachers have been told that they were going to be treated as professionals and that there would be a partnership with teachers, we have seen very little evidence of this over the last couple of years. </PARA>

In this case, we have the story about a secondary college at Hoppers Crossing, in Melbourne's west, that is seeking a professional fund-raiser to bolster revenue for new computer equipment. This is after it wrote to over 140 local businesses to try to get contributions of up to $30,000 to cover the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion is that people try to get the local community involved in this type of sponsorship for the schools, but it is nonsense to believe that this is going to happen equitably across the socioeconomic stream in Melbourne suburbs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is an omnibus measure proposing the validation of certain ministerial declarations and the amendment of three Bounty Acts: namely, the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 (the Computer Bounty Act), the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985 (the Machine Tools and Robots Act) and the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994 (the Fuel Ethanol Act). There are three major elements proposed in this bill. The first relates to the validation of certain untabled ministerial declarations made under the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non-tabling of these declarations was discovered as a result of an investigation into the status of all legal instruments administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology that was instigated by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) after the discovery of a similar administrative oversight in relation to guidelines under the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. The minister made a statement in the Senate on 26 June 1995 concerning the bounty legislation problem, and the validation element of this bill is designed to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act have a declaration facility by which the minister can vary the classes of equipment eligible for bounty so that new technologies can be brought into the schemes as they arise. The facility is designed to allow the schemes to cater for the rapid technological advances which are a feature of these industry sectors. In order to maintain parliamentary scrutiny of the classes of equipment eligible for bounty, the ministerial declarations are subject to the same tabling and disallowance procedures applicable to other forms of subsidiary legislation by the express application of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to table 20 declarations under the Computer Bounty Act and a further 12 under the Machine Tools and Robots Act has resulted in each declaration being invalidated after 15 sitting days of its making. A consequence of the legal invalidity of the declarations is that all decisions and acts or things done in reliance on those declarations, including applications claiming bounty, assessments of claims and decisions to pay or refuse bounty, are also invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 5 and 6 of the bill propose to address the invalidity problems by validating the declarations, and any decisions made, or acts or things done, in reliance on those declarations, from the time of their commencement as notified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, until the royal assent commencement of this bill. Clause 7 of the Bill expressly extinguishes the Commonwealth's right to recover any amounts paid on the production of goods purportedly made bountiable under the declaration facility of both acts. This will overcome the situation of Commonwealth officers having a duty to recover what have become unauthorised payments out of consolidated revenue and is appropriate given the fact that the various payments that have been made in reliance on the declarations over the years were always intended to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the bill involves the incorporation of the effect of the three valid current declarations into the Computer Bounty Act and the Machine Tools and Robots Act. Schedules 2 and 3 to the bill incorporate into each of the acts the various classes of goods which are presently bountiable via the declaration facility. The goods to be inserted under the relevant definitions of `bountiable equipment' have been the subject of new declarations gazetted in August and September 1995 and have been tabled in each house of parliament as required of section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three declarations remade the effect of seven of the invalid declarations and were made so that bounty payments relating to claims on hand could be processed during the time between the discovery of the invalidity and the passage of this validating bill. The remaining invalid declarations were not remade as their effect had already been incorporated into the principal acts by various bounty legislation amendment bills or they had become redundant because the technology to which they related has been superseded. </PARA>

I consider that periodically incorporating future declarations into the principal acts will also help to ensure their legal correctness and legal drafting in a way that has not always been the case in the past. This should obviate the need for repeating this exercise in the future by better aligning the declaration facility with the express parliamentary controls in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final element of the bill implements the government's 1995-96 budget decision in relation to the Fuel Ethanol Act. The Fuel Ethanol Act gives effect to a scheme to assist in the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. The three-year scheme, which commenced on 1 July 1994, provides for the payment of a bounty of 18c for each litre of fuel ethanol produced, providing certain criteria are met. One of these criteria is that bounty should only be paid on `new production' of fuel ethanol, which effectively imposed an extra production requirement on pre-1 July 1994 producers by only making bountiable that production in excess of the average of fuel ethanol produced in 1992 and 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the eligibility criteria under the Fuel Ethanol Act in schedule 1 to the bill are to give effect to the 1995 budget decision to ensure all eligible fuel ethanol producers can claim bounty on the same production criteria, irrespective of whether they were engaged in production prior to the 1 July 1994 commencement of the Fuel Ethanol Act. </PARA>

As well, I might be doing the work of my colleague the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is our shadow minister for resources and energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than take the time of the House and repeat the things that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has just read out in his speech that outlines the detail of this bill, I would like to make the point which the minister did not make in his speech: that a great deal of this bill comes about as a consequence of the failure of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to do its job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has pointed out, there are a number of aspects of this bill that are designed to make valid things that were not valid as a consequence of the department's failing to table declarations, as was required by the respective acts. Therefore, due to the department's failure to table those declarations, a lot of the things that have been undertaken under this act have been technically invalid. As a consequence, various aspects of this legislation&mdash;clauses 3, 6 and 7, and possibly other clauses as well&mdash;are designed to, in a sense, retrospectively make valid those things that were technically invalid because of the department's failure to properly table these declarations according to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that needs to be noted in the discussion relating to this bill. The opposition has said that it is not going to oppose this bill and I guess it is for that reason that it is in this chamber. But the opposition wants to take this opportunity to point out to the chamber that the department has not acted in a competent fashion in regard to this. This has led to a number of things being technically invalid, things that the comptroller-general and the chief executive officer have been carrying out and things that have not had proper legal sanction. A whole host of other things that have been done in the belief that they are legally valid actually have not been legally valid and, in part at least, this bill is designed to retrospectively make valid those things that were technically invalid, so we register our complaint and our concern about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my area of transport, a lot of the legislation that we have in the House is actually legislation that amends things as a result of incompetence at the time of the original drafting. Often things are missed out or are incorrectly written into legislation and often things are not properly thought through. Whilst people might think that that is only a fairly minor thing, as we know, the cost of any legislation and, therefore, the cost of these mistakes is very great. It is a cost to the taxpayers of Australia that could be avoided. On behalf of my colleague Senator Parer, I register our concern and criticism in this chamber and make the point that we will not be opposing the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey was designed jointly by staff of the Department of Human Services and Health and Electronic Trading Concepts, with advice from a liaison committee of industry representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surveys were distributed with a covering letter and a stamped, addressed return envelope, on 7 September 1994 with a closing date of 26 September 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thousand one hundred and forty seven returns were received by the time data entry commenced on 14 October 1994. This represents a response rate of 79%. The lowest response rate was in the Northern Territory with 71% and the highest in the ACT with 100%. However the numbers in the Territories are very small; if the Territories are excluded the response rate ranged from 76&mdash;84%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using the standard departmental definitions of capital cities, rural areas and remote areas, there was a 77% response from homes in capital cities, an 84% response from homes in rural areas and a 77% response from homes in remote areas. The numbers of these latter were of course small&mdash;27 responses out of 36 homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Replies were also fairly evenly distributed across sectors as recorded on the nursing homes payment system. Response rate was 86% for religious and charitable (C) homes and 85% for Transferred (X) homes (largely comprising religious and charitable homes). Adjusted fee homes (S) had a response rate of 81%, government homes (G) and private for profit homes (E) each 74%. Although, aside from the Territories, the response rate was fairly even among States for religious and charitable (C and X homes), there are greater differences in response among the private for profit homes which range from a response rate of 57% in Tasmania to 86% in Queensland. There were also large discrepancies in the percentage returns from Government homes (0% in South Australia to 100% in Victoria) but the numbers in each case are so small that these discrepancies are not significant. All responses from Government and adjusted fee homes should be treated with caution for this reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Response rates increased with the size of the nursing home, although within a limited range&mdash;the lowest rate was 78% from homes with 19 beds or less, the highest was 86% from homes of 150 beds or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall there is no reason to suppose that the responses received were not representative of the nursing home population as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Completion of Departmental forms</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question on the survey asked about the completion of Departmental forms. The aim of this question was to establish which forms were completed in the nursing home itself, which by the head office of an organisation and which by a management company. It was hoped that this would give some indicator of whether electronic commerce would need to be implemented for fifteen hundred individual users in the long run, or for a smaller number who would be undertaking work for the majority of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from the responses to this question that most forms are completed in the nursing home itself. The form which is most likely to be filled at the nursing home is the NH4, Application for Resident Classification, which requires personal knowledge of the resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The form which is least likely to be completed at the nursing home is the Annual Reconciliation, the NH20. In fact this is the only form of which more are completed outside the nursing home than at the nursing home. This form is complex and is more likely to require accounting skills. It is therefore the form most likely to be completed by a management company (21%).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nursing homes were asked whether they used paper or computer records to complete Departmental forms, in an attempt to calculate how much transcription for existing records goes on. Responses varied between forms, with computers being used most for the NH20 (46% of respondents), the NH3 (31%) and the NH3a (35%). For all other forms, less than 10% of respondents used computer records to complete the forms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Computer, fax and modem use</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total 88% of nursing homes who replied have a computer. These are evenly divided among States and Territories, with the Territories at the extremes (100% in the ACT and 80% in the NT). The response rate was highest in WA with 96%. Across sectors, the private-for-profit sector had fewer computers&mdash;79% of respondents compared with over 90% in all other sectors. Geographical location made little difference and nor did bed numbers (responses ranged from 86% in the smallest two bed groupings to 100% in the homes over 150 beds with an even progression in between).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eighty eight percent of homes had a fax machine. These are not necessarily exactly the same group as those who have a computer&mdash;81% of homes had both a computer and a fax. Fax ownership was lowest (80% of respondents) in the private for profit sector and highest among C homes. Between States (excluding the Territories) it was highest in New South Wales (96%) and lowest in South Australia (75%). As might be expected, fax use went up steadily on the spectrum State capital-rural-remote and with bed size, although the lowest usage was 80% in beds in the 20-39 grouping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 48% of homes had a modem.

The majority of homes with a computer used an IBM compatible PC (75%); eleven percent used a mini mainframe and only 2% an Apple Mac. Of those with an IBM compatible PC, the most common software was Windows (63%) followed by DOS (44%). Homes were also asked who developed the software they used: answers to this question were various, including some which indicated that the question has not been understood and many who had developed the system themselves or using other in-house resources. However a number of organisations&mdash;Care Systems, Trimicro, Australian Nursing Home Accounting&mdash;were mentioned a number of times. This list has been passed to the consultants to assist in contacts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Homes without computer</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Homes without a computer were asked whether they had plans to buy one, and whether if the Department offered the facility of electronic data interchange, they would buy one. Of the 93 respondents who did not have a computer, 32% indicated that they planned to buy one (and inspired by the survey, a handful of nursing homes telephoned to ask for advice on doing so!). Twenty nine percent indicated that they would buy if they could engage in electronic claims transfer. Further analysis is required to see to what extent these groups overlap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government is not considering online reporting facilities, but is exploring an option of allowing nursing homes to transmit claims information electronically. The Department wrote to peak nursing home industry groups in August 1994 and received nominations for an Industry Liaison Committee on Electronic Commerce. This Committee has met five times to discuss the setting up of a pilot project to facilitate electronic commerce between the Department and nursing homes. The pilot will evaluate the feasibility of transmitting nursing home benefits claims information electronically from the nursing home or management company directly to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Depending on the outcome of the pilot, electronic transmission of claims information and other data will be an alternative available to all nursing home proprietors who wish to participate in the arrangements. Submission of paper claims and applications will be retained as an alternative for all those nursing homes who do not wish to embrace electronic commerce, or who think that electronic commerce is not an economic alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage several service providers are indicating strong interest in electronic transmission. This is not, however, seen by the Government as an alternative to continuing to streamline and improve administrative practices which has been a focus of activity for some time, at least since my acceptance of the report of the Nursing Home Consultative Committee, chaired by Sir William Keys.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. These details are not available to my Department as it only has access to information regarding the usage of medicines listed on the PBS. Ritalin has not yet been listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The two stimulant medications used to treat ADD are dexamphetamine sulfate and methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin). (Other drugs such as antidepressants may also be used.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. The clinical trial evidence presented to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (two trials with small numbers) indicates that most children will respond to both drugs, a few will fail to benefit from both and some who do not respond to methylphenidate will respond to dexamphetamine and vice versa.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) One drug is listed under the PBS and the other is not. Listing is dependent on both acceptable effectiveness and value for money being proven for all drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes. The PBAC recommended PBS listing of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablet 10 mg for use in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, in accordance with State/Territory law.</PARA>
