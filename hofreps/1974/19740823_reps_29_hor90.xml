        <para>That each Autumn and Spring the increase in social security pension payments be not less than $3 per week to ensure that within a reasonable period the Government&#39;s policy pledge to affix all pensions at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings be achieved. </para>
        <para>In order that money may go to areas of greater need the Tapered Means Test ceilings of income and assets be frozen. </para>

            <para>-As I am reminded by my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland, it was at great expense. Let us not overlook that there is great expense in calling the Parliament together. But the fact is that today, 23 August, the Parliament is assembled in the form of the House of Representatives and while this House is assembled, with all its members here, if there is no discussion of the major matter occupying the attention of every man, woman and teenager in Australia, it will be an abandonment and an abdication of the true role of the House of Representatives. There must be a debate on these major issues. The Government should not think that it can assemble the House and then use the march of numbers to prevent question time- an action more lacking in courage we have never seen in this House-or that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> who has remained silent and refused to give any leadership because he does not know how to, can ask that all questions be put on the notice paper to try to save embarrassment. There has not been an occasion in the memory of this House when, the House having been assembled in the morning of the first day of an ordinary sitting, there has not been a question time. It has not happened before. That the Prime Minister should take action not to allow question time merely shows that he is determined that there will be no discussion of economic matters by the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>So that those who take an interest in the affairs of the Parliament may know what is happening, let me say that under the Standing Orders there is provision for a matter of public importance to be raised. The way in which a matter of public importance is raised is for the person wishing to raise it to write to the  Speaker.  Under the Standing Orders there is provision, after the  Speaker  reports to the House that a matter of public importance has been raised, for the matter then to be debated for up to 2 hours. On every occasion on which this House sits there is the opportunity for a matter of public importance to be raised. The reason for that provision in the Standing Orders is that the people who put together the Standing Orders and the people who have lived in this Parliament over the years have always recognised that if this Parliament is to represent the people the matters that are concerning the people should be debated. The matters that are concerning the people today are unemployment, industrial disputes and strikes and the lack of confidence in the community, and those were the very things which were contained in my letter to the  Speaker  raising a matter of public importance. </para>
        <para>The Parliament having been assembled, one would have expected that the matter of public importance would have been debated. One would have expected that the Government would have said: &#39;Yes, we will answer. We will say what we think about those things&#39;. Instead of that, members of the Government Party take a coward&#39;s retreat and use their numbers to prevent the discussion of the matter of public importance. The Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> who is sitting at the table, probably intends to threaten us once again by saying that if we have the temerity to move for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to debate these great national issues, these things that threaten the living standard of the Australian people, he will by the march of his numbers take action against us. If the Opposition in the Senate, where the numbers are different, then says: &#39;There will be debate in the national Parliament, in one of the Houses&#39;, members of the Government Party and a number of misunderstanding commentators and members of the media will say that we are obstructing. We are not obstructing. We are determined that these matters will be ventilated. If we did not do that we would be abandoning our responsibility to the Australian people, and we will not abandon our responsibility to the Australian people. We are determined that these matters should be debated. </para>
        <para>What are the facts that we find? The Treasurer of this country <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> is a broken man. He is as broken as the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard).</inline> &#39;It is impossible &#39;, says a member of the Labor Party. </para>

            <para>-One reason why we should have a debate on this matter is that the Treasurer is a broken man. We have not heard anything from him as to economic direction. All we have heard is that the Treasury is to be the scapegoat for the dereliction and failure of the Labor Party in Government. Meanwhile, the Treasurer says not a single word in order to state his views or to defend the Treasury. The Treasury may have its faults, but it is not to blame for what has happened. What an extraordinary performance we have had from the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns).</inline> He is the only person in the Government who is speaking on matters economic. But this is his track form: A month ago he was saying that we would face 350,000 unemployed. He was disbelieved then. A week ago he said that there was no need to trade off unemployment in order to contain inflation. He was applauded for that. A week later he says that there will be 150,000 to 200,000 unemployed and that the system is to blame. The system in Australia is the democratic process, the Parliamentary process, and if that is to blame we need a debate about it here. The system is the institutions in this country and the major institution in Australia is the democratically elected Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>If the democratically elected Parliament comes together it should not be deprived of the opportunity of exposing what has happened and what has not happened. When the Parliament comes together it should be allowed to expose the lack of confidence in the community resulting from the conflicting statements which Ministers make. We have had statements made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister which conflict with other statements he has made at other times. We have had the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> and the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> making statements in total disagreement. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> declines to say anything at all. He is unwilling to submit himself to questioning by this Parliament, by the media or by his own side. Honourable members opposite could also have asked questions at question time. The Prime Minister has said that what he will do is to take refuge in a television studio and there, in the silence of the studio, surrounded only by his own people he will have the capacity to say something, edit it, do it again and rehearse it so that out will come something which he reckons will represent his views. Is that the way in which this country is to be run? How can people have confidence in that, when we are not being given the opportunity in this place to question and to probe? There has been a total abdication - </para>

            <para>- I mean the Government is making a sham of the Parliament. But the way Government supporters are going on it will not be long before they are in opposition. They are falling into complete disarray. We even wonder sometimes who is going to be the Prime Minister from day to day. This Government is making a sham of Parliament. It called us back at great expense to amend 2 Bills which represent a compromise arrangement between the Opposition and the Government. A week ago the Government was saying that the Senate was acting as an obstructionist House and was frustrating the Government. Yet the Government is now accepting the amendments moved in the Senate because it is not prepared to face up to the Australian people with the tactics it was pursuing to have more and more central power in Canberra. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>We are all gathered in this Parliament today but the Opposition is given no right to express its points of view. Question time has been dispensed with- a very rare performance in this House. The Opposition has asked for a debate on the economy and industrial affairs when the country is gripped in one of the worst economic and industrial crises ever. The nation is clamouring for leadership. The people want some indication from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> as to what the policies of the Government are, but they are hearing nothing. All they see is the Prime Minister acting like the titular head of the nation while the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> goes ahead and makes more and more statements each day. Obviously he is the man with all the executive power while the Prime Minister is nothing more than a constitutional mark. He does not give the leadership which this country desperately needs at the moment. Yet we hear and read in the newspapers of growing concern and unrest, meetings being organised and fear in the hearts of people, and we wonder just where the whole situation is going to end. Inflation is running rampant, there is a shortage of goods, petrol is unavailable. </para>
        <para>Surely this is a time when this House ought to be given the opportunity to have a full and comprehensive debate on these matters instead of members being stifled the way they are. The 2 Bills that the House has been brought together to consider can be handled in a matter of minutes. Why not allow the Prime Minister to make his nationwide address here in this Parliament instead of on television next week? Is he frightened of criticism? Is he frightened of counter points of view being put forward? There are counter points of view. Everybody is concerned about the statements which are emanating from the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the  Deputy  Prime Minister. The  Deputy  Prime Minister talks about the system as the cause of the Government&#39;s trouble. Of course, last week the Senate caused the trouble, and a few weeks before that it was foreign capital and multinational corporations. Now it is being said that the system should be changed; that we ought to have a socialist system. Apparently the only way to control inflation is to put the whole economy into a straitjacket. </para>

            <para>- These are the reasons why we believe there ought to be a full debate. Let the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> get up and put his point of view. He is not game or he is frightened that his Department will be further discredited by members of his own Government. It is a shocking state of affairs when the Treasury is being denigrated and downgraded publicly and being used as a scapegoat, as the Leader of the Opposition said, for the inadequacy and incompetence of this Government in its management of the economy. The economy is in the worst mess we have seen it in. We just do not know where this Government will finish up in its handling of the economy. A Budget will be presented in a few weeks time, but surely today would have been a wonderful time, by way of preamble to the Budget, to have a debate about how the people are feeling and for the Opposition at least to express what I believe is the majority view of the Australian people, who have just about completely lost confidence in this Government and its handling of economic and industrial matters. </para>

          <para>- This motion arises out of the failure of the Government to allow the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> to embark on a propaganda campaign earlier in the day. The matter of public importance on which debate was disallowed had all the contents of a censure motion against the Government, but it is significant that the Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to move a censure motion. I will tell the House why. </para>

            <para>- Until I goaded the Leader of the Opposition, he wanted to introduce an urgency motion on which he knew there would be no division and therefore the insignificent numbers of members who followed him from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Canberra to gobble up members of the Government would not be revealed. We have given 8 live pairs to the Opposition. Two or three members of the Opposition are ill, as has been said, and several are overseas. But in the division this morning the Opposition could muster only 47 votes. Yet it claims its members are the ones who care about the economy. They know as well as I do that their motion is phony. The Leader of the Opposition now has a deathbed confession. He is writing out a motion to censure the Government. I goaded him into it. The full 47 Opposition members will stagger into this place and will show the motley collection of people who say they ought to be governing the country. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Some members of the Opposition are not prepared to come to the Parliament. It costs money to get them here. The Leader of the Opposition, as I said, flew in from the alligator country, alerted all and sundry and told the Press and the radio people. But when he got here he found he had only 47 members behind him and he was not prepared to move a censure motion which he says he is now going to do. He will have a chance to do so in the Budget session. He will tell the House that he is now going to move a censure motion. Even at this stage I have to write out the ideas for him. He is a real bright leader. He is now scribbling out a dreadful motion to condemn the Government. We will shortly see whether the Opposition is able to muster up 48 in a crisis. </para>
        <para>Some members of the Opposition are not in their electorates. Some of them could not be bothered to come back here to debate the great issues that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned. They had 4 days to get here. One chap is not here because he could not come by air. He could have walked from his electorate to this place in 4 days, but he could not be bothered coming along. It is of no use for Opposition members to say they do not know why this motion is being put on. In another place those obstructionist old gentlemen on the opposite side of the chamber have stopped Bills being passed. </para>

            <para>- It is a most important matter for which this House has been called together today. It deals with trade practices, national roads and roads grants. The Bills affect the lives and welfare of countless millions of Australians. In addition they deal with many practices that were mentioned today concerning inflation and all that goes with it. It is vital that this Parliament discuss them. In another place that obstructionist Opposition which has thrown overboard every semblance of decency and democracy is forcing the Australian people to suffer unless we put this legislation through today. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall- the only Liberal in the Senate- said that it is &#39;bloody minded obstruction&#39;. He said in the Senate that the Opposition is endeavouring to make it unworkable and whatever might be wrong with the economy today he put it at the doorsteps of those who support the Opposition in another place and members of the Opposition know the reason for this. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall said: &#39;Australia would not function if the Senate Opposition had its way&#39;. That is why there is trouble in the economy today. He went on to say: &#39;This blind antagonism to anything that is government will never be the basis for a new lease of life for liberalism. &#39; He went on to criticise the Opposition in regard to its activities in the Senate. </para>

        <para>Yet today we have called this Parliament together to discuss legislation dealing with contracts, arrangements and understandings in restraint of trade, monopolisation, exclusive dealings, resale price maintenance and all these kinds of things. The Leader of the Opposition, who has fallen for his own propaganda, wants to grandstand on issues which he knows have nothing to do with the debates today. We gave him his opportunity to move his censure motion. We gave him his opportunity to do all these things. </para>
        <para class="block">His proposition is a phoney one because many of his members have not turned up for the sitting. </para>
        <para>The Labor Party has won 2 successive elections. The people have endorsed our policies. The ALP has been resisted on every occasion by those who sit opposite and by the obstructionist people in the other place. I can understand the rumblings of discontent from the other side of the Parliament. Honourable members opposite have never accepted that they are not the government. They are a government in exile and will be for a long long time to come. They have never accepted that fact. They are trying to run the Government from another place and from that side of the chamber. They would not get a new idea if the Labor Party did not have regular elections so that they could pick up some of the ideas which we put forward. I have got the Leader of the Opposition writing out a censure motion of the Government because he could not think of it himself. </para>
        <para>Everybody knows that the Opposition is a complete rabble, is worn out and is disunited. In another place it is comprised of a lot of doddering old supporters who are holding up democracy and progress. In this place, as I look at some of the temporary occupants of seats opposite, I think it would be a good idea to have an election, whenever it might be held, in order that they might disappear into the limbo of the forgotten. Let the public never forget that on this day, when it is vital that Australia have certain legislation passed, only 47 members of the Opposition were prepared to come to Canberra to debate it. One or two are ill, but a lot of them who could have been here could not be bothered coming back from their world trips or jaunts or wherever they might be. That proves how phoney the proposition and everything associated with it are. </para>

            <para>- I have sought the indulgence of the House and, in particular, of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in order that there may be no misrepresentation as to the intent of my vote in the last division. When the division bells commenced to ring I was engaged in an important telephone conversation. I came into the chamber, bringing with me some work which I wanted to read over as it is work which is very vital to my constituents. Unfortunately I naturally sat in my normal seat after I had walked into the chamber. I did so without realising that the Government forces were voting no on this issue. I wish honourable members to keep in mind that I could not hear the debate and that I was speaking on the telephone when the division was called. Also, when I came into the House I was reading correspondence which vitally affects my constituents. I wish to make it clear that it was and always has been my intention to vote with the Australian Labor Party, the Government of Australia. </para>

            <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the immediate debate of the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition on 23 August. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">I move this motion because it is quite clear that the Government has taken a conscious decision that it will, in no circumstances, allow the major issues of the day to be debated in this Parliament. The Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> chided me for not moving a motion of censure of the Government. What he did not know was that it was my intention progressively to expose the decision of the Government not to allow debate and that when we reached the stage which we now have reached I would move that the Government be censured for its cowardice in being unwilling to debate matters and for its gross dereliction of duty by not allowing the issues which concern the public to come up for debate. This combination of cowardice in the face of fire and the Government&#39;s dereliction of duty in not taking action to protect the Australian people is the reason why the Government should be censured. That was the next step in the procedure. </para>
          <para>Let me just recount what the procedures have been today. We assembled here at 10.30 a.m. According to Standing Orders the first item on the agenda should have been questions without notice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you called for questions without notice but, before a single question could be put, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in accordance with what he can do under Standing Orders- what he would normally do threequarters of an hour after the House sits- asked that all questions be put on the notice paper. I ask the Whips, please, to have their conversation behind the Chair. </para>
          <para>Under the Standing Orders, the way in which the business of the House proceeds after questions is for the Prime Minister to ask- not to move- that further questions be put on the notice paper. By convention that is done three-quarters of an hour after the House assembles. Today, before a single question was asked, the Prime Minister took that escape. It was a cowardly act. He wants to avoid answering questions about the differences of opinion between Ministers in his Cabinet. He wants to avoid trying to reconcile their differences. Most importantly, the Prime Minister wants to avoid being put in a position where his answers can be taken to be putting him either on the side of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> or on the side of the  Deputy  Prime Minister, the Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns).</inline> He wishes to avoid being seen to be holding the view which he does hold, if in fact he does hold a view. Nobody knows whether the Prime Minister has a view. For reasons that are apparent, I decided that the best course of action was to take advantage of the Standing Orders which provide that a matter of public importance can be called on for debate. The intention to raise a matter of public importance is notified by letter to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and under the Standing Orders the debate on the matter can proceed for 2 hours. The practice of this House, since I was Leader of the House and made the arrangement with the then Opposition, has been that in each sitting week 2 hours will be allowed for the discussion of matters of public importance. That arrangement has subsisted since I was Leader of the House some years ago and has worked very well. There was a reasonable expectation therefore, having regard to the Standing Orders, that today we would have a 2-hour debate on the matter of public importance which I raised and which asked the Parliament to discuss the vacuum in leadership, unemployment and the lack of confidence in the community. </para>
          <para>Despite the normal practice that has existed in this Parliament over a period of time, the Leader of the House immediately stood up and moved that Government business be called on, and therefore stifled any consideration whatever of the matter of public importance which I raised. Of course, the Opposition voted against that proposal. But the march of numbers defeated us. The Opposition has been denied question time. It has been denied the opportunity to debate the lack of confidence in the community and unemployment which ranges in estimates by the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister from 150,000 to 200,000 people. People will be out of work; there will be social dislocation; and personal harm will be suffered by those unemployed people and their families. But we are not allowed to debate this matter or to ask the Government what it proposes to do to prevent this from happening. Are we to be asked to join those lemmings and walk over the cliff? Are the 150,000 to 200,000 people just to be abandoned? The Prime Minister, who is now in the House, is putting suggestions to the Leader of the House. Why does he not stand up like a man and state in debate - </para>

              <para>-We therefore proceeded in a proper manner. As I have said, we were denied the opportunity to ask questions and the opportunity to raise a matter of public importance. Then I moved for the suspension of Standing Orders so that this House, having been assembled, would not adjourn until there had been a full debate on economic issues, unemployment, the vacuum in leadership and so on. We voted against the Government&#39;s proposal that we proceed with the business of the House. In other words, we voted for the suspension of Standing Orders. But again the march of numbers defeated us. So we have now arrived at the stage at which I have moved a censure motion on the Government. Under the Standing Orders debate on the motion must be set down for the next sitting which will be Budget day, presumably, unless there is another panic call for a sitting of the House. My notice of motion is as follows: </para>

            <para>I give notice that at the next sitting I will move: That the Government be censured for its avoidance of the processes of debate in the House of Representatives when the country is alarmed about unemployment, industrial strikes and the vacuum in leadership and properly expects that these issues be debated. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We have taken the next step of moving for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow that debate to proceed immediately. We have to win the vote on the suspension of Standing Orders if we are to debate this matter. Of course, we know that we cannot win the vote because the march of numbers will apply against us. The way by which the debate can proceed is for the Government to agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>
          <para>It is a long-standing principle of this Parliament that when a censure motion is moved the House proceeds with that matter immediately. The Standing Orders provide that any Minister can announce that the Government accepts the censure motion and it will then take precedence over everything else until it is disposed of. The Government, through the Leader of the House when he was speaking, invited the Opposition to move a censure motion. He did it because he wanted to chide the Opposition, but the fact is that he made that invitation without knowing that I was going right through the process to develop this point. Now let us have the debate on the censure motion, or does the Government lack the courage to do so? </para>
          <para>The Leader of the House said that the Opposition does not have the numbers here. I think that 10 members of the Opposition are not here. The reason for that is that this sitting, called to debate the Trade Practices Bill and the Roads Grants Bill, need not occur today. There was no need for it at all. It would not have held up government in the slightest way. It will take some time for the trade practices legislation to come into operation. The fact that the Bill was not passed today would not make one iota of difference because the Government could have proceeded with the setting up of the arrangements anyway. It will still be necessary for the Roads Grants Bill to wait until the Senate approves amendments which the Government intends to move in this House. So it occasions the Government nothing to have this sitting. </para>
          <para>I was unwilling to call back people who had gone overseas. They had waited until the adjournment of the House to go overseas and do their business while the House was not sitting. Some honourable members went into hospital to have operations while the House was not sitting, and I did not intend to get them out of hospital for this purpose. But the Government must have known that something was likely to happen because it kept its members back from overseas and out of hospital. Furthermore, it advised its members to come here on Wednesday because the Government expected a strike on Thursday. What did the Government do? </para>

              <para>- Yes, you are pretty blue and you will be bluer by the time we finish with you. It should not have been necessary to move this motion but the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> in his usual smart alec way, challenged the Opposition to move a censure motion. The Opposition did not want unduly to take up the time of the House today. It wanted to debate a matter of public importance, so that the matter could be debated publicly and so that the Parliament could be used as a safety-valve for free expression in this country. But the Opposition was criticised for even wanting to do that. Apparently it was supposed to move a censure motion. I can well imagine that the Government would feel that a censure motion might be moved against it because it is in such a mess and in such disarray, because there is such a vacuum of leadership and because there is such industrial chaos in the country, but the Opposition felt that this was not the appropriate time for a censure motion. However, as the Leader of the House wants to force the issue, we believe we ought to have a debate and we are prepared to have a debate. In a minute when the Leader of the House goes on with his normal tirade about taking up the time of this Parliament, let him not accuse the Opposition, because he is responsible for this motion to suspend Standing Orders. </para>

          <para>What chaos the country is in! We see unemployement rising at the rate of about 4,000 a week. Even Ministers are predicting that the number is likely to rise to 200,000 or 250,000 by early next year. Unemployment is growing in country areas. Indeed, it is much worse there than in the capital cities. But of course this Government never shows any sympathy to those people outside the metropolitan areas. Forty per cent of the population exists outside the capital cities and at the moment 52 per cent of the unemployed are in those areas. Only 26 per cent of the vacancies are in country areas. In other words the ratio of people applying for jobs to the number of vacancies is about 4 to 1. This situation is deteriorating rapidly as economic circumstances in rural industries- primary, mining and secondaryget very much worse. </para>

Apparently one system they wish to change is the free expression of this Parliament by the use of its full debating facilities. They want to change the capitalist system, attack private enterprise and to replace it with socialism, with Government control and Government involvement. They are on the march. They are ruthless and determined. They are going to crawl right over the top of the Prime Minister to achieve their aspirations. If it drives the Prime Minister mad, well and good.

            <para>- In my view both the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> and the Leader of the Australian Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> ought to be members of Actors Equity. We have heard the same old record, the same old arguments and the same old tactics. The leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country Party came to this Parliament this morning and put forward a motion which had all the semblance of a censure motion. But it was framed as an urgency motion on which there would not have been a vote, no doubt. They even sought an agreement on how many speakers there would be. The reason for that is that 14 members of the Opposition, including 4 shadow Ministers, are away. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Members of the Opposition never had a thought about a censure motion until they were goaded into it earlier by me. Even then you cannot please the Leader of the Opposition. He gave notice that he would move this motion on the next day of sitting. He now says that he wants to move it today. Why does he not make up his mind? Did he want to move the motion today? Why could he not follow Standing Orders? He is trying to make the best of a bad job. As he always does, he fumbled the opportunity earlier in the day. He now comes forward with this second rate proposition seeking to air, he says, all the things that are wrong in the community. If we debated the Bills, which he said would go through in a few minutes, we would find that they have far reaching effects on the matters he has mentioned. The Bills are of tremendous importance. </para>
          <para>Why should we take the Opposition seriously when 14 of its members will not come to Canberra to fulfil their responsibilities? They are rambling around the world, in Asia and in other places, and will not front up. Why should we put up with a censure motion today when members opposite would be shown up as not having the numbers? Why, we even loaned them one of our members a while ago and they were still a mile behind. What a joke Opposition members make of a censure motion. They know they do not have the numbers here and they do not care what is happening. They are more inclined to go holidaying than anything else. It costs money to get this Parliament together, but it was called together today because the trade practices and roads legislation have far reaching effects. The Country Party growls about our bringing its members back here in order to debate roads legislation which allocates countless millions of dollars for people throughout the country areas and other districts. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition fumbled his chance earlier. As I said he would not get a bright idea unless we told him one now and again. He is staving off discussion on the Bills we are to have before us today. The Opposition in another place has altered the Trade Practices legislation in such a way as to deny the people the benefits of it. But the Government in the Senate obtained an absolute majority in the vote on that legislation. There were so many loopholes in the previous legislation that the Leader of the Opposition knew that those whom we sought to bring within the confines of our legislation would escape if it were not passed. He is making this last ditch stand under the guise of great national issues to stave off imminent defeat like the defeat he suffered at the Joint Sitting of the Parliament a few days ago. The Leader of the Opposition believes his own propaganda. When you start to believe what you write yourself, you are nearly around the bend. He thinks that all the things he is saying are right. He never wanted the Trade Practices legislation and he resents the fact that the Senate has passed it. He is trying to delay it in every way possible. He will try to keep up these tactics all day because he does not want to debate the issues contained in the Bills that have been returned to the House of Representatives. The Government will make him debate the Bills today. If four of his shadow Ministers will not return to Canberra for this parliamentary sitting, why should we worry? When he was making his speech on this motion, his Whip was talking to a colleague. The Leader of the Opposition had to tell his Whip to sit down and listen to his words of wisdom. If his own Whip will not listen to him, why should anybody else? </para>
          <para>We are told that it is a long standing principle that a motion of censure should always be debated immediately. We did not want to disappoint the Leader of the Opposition. He wanted to have it debated on the next day of sitting. Why should we disappoint him? But I point out that that is not always the practice. The Government lays down when these motions will be dealt with. This motion will be dealt with at the time at which the Leader of the Opposition gave notice for it to be brought on, that is, the next day of sitting. We are not going to let him stave off the debate today and his moment of decision and destiny, when he sees the legislation that he does not want passed- the Trade Practices legislationpassed through this Parliament. We will bring him to book today. No matter what tactics he employs today, he will not put off the Government in bringing forward the debate on these Bills. </para>
          <para>I suppose nothing has a more far-reaching effect on the community than the issues we are bringing forward today. They relate to the protection of all consumers in the country and cover things such as advertising, manufacturing processes, the quality and quantity of goods and in a dozen and one ways will give protection to the people of this country- protection so sadly denied because of the obstruction in another place. Let me ask members of the Australian Country Party: Do you not want to discuss national highways today? Do you not want to discuss the expenditure of $ 1 , 1 26m over the next 3 years? Do you not want to make provision for financial assistance for the States for road construction and maintenance, transport planning and research? I ask them to stand up and be counted. Do they not think that such matters are important? I point out to honourable members that in another place members of the Opposition stopped the passage of this legislation. Do members of the Country Party not want to construct rural arterial roads, developmental roads, rural local roads, urban arterial roads and beef roads? Do members of the Country Party not think that they are important? Why should the </para>
          <para class="block">Government put off the debate on such important matters for a phoney proposition such as that moved by the Leader of the Opposition when he never thought of it today until we suggested that his motion contained all the ingredients for the moving of a motion of censure? He was not game to move such a motion today because of the lack of numbers on the Opposition side. It is no good the Leader of the Opposition telling us that he had a second idea. He never gets a first idea, let alone a second one. So it is never any good for him to say that he was going to move such a motion today. If he thinks he is going to do this all day, he is in for a terrible shock in that respect also. </para>
          <para>I ask the Leader of the Australian Country Party: Do you not want to discuss legislation to improve road safety, legislation which benefits the city and country dwellers and which will pay particular attention to primary industry? We have seen the Leader of the Australian Country Party rising in the Parliament today trying to defer consideration of these matters and talking as if he is the protector of people in the country. No wonder a former Prime Minister said that he lost the election because of the Country Party. But I take a bit of the blame off the Leader of the Country Party because the Liberal Party could have lost the election on its own without him. The situation is that these matters will be discussed in the Parliament today. Do Opposition members mean to say that they do not want to discuss trade practices, the manipulation of prices and the exploitation of consumers? Do they mean to say that these things are not important at this very moment? Why should the Government fall for the trick that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward today? </para>
          <para>I direct my remarks again to the Leader of the Opposition. As I say, he is up to his old stalling tricks again.  His  philosophy is: Put it off as long as you can; put it off even in the event of a Joint Sitting; put off legislation endorsed by the Australian people. When he knows that he is beaten, try to stall, to put things off and go to court and appeal against decisions. He was stalling right up to the last available minute in regard to the 6 Bills passed at the Joint Sitting recently. Today we have seen the same old tactics and the same old approach by the Leader of the Opposition. I repeat that if the Leader of the Opposition was going to move a censure motion, which everybody knows that he was not, do Opposition members mean to say that four of his shadow Ministers would have been away from the Parliament? They would not have been absent from the sitting of the Parliament if they took the position seriously. Also thirteen or fourteen of the Opposition members would have not been absent if that were the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you know as well as I that the Leader of the Opposition never even thought of moving such a motion. He just wrote out a censure motion, was not game to move it, and thought he would back out because of the lack of numbers. I say that if it does come on today, of which I am extremely doubtful, all pairs are off and the public can see the lack of support the Leader of the Opposition has for any motion he puts up, with his members rambling around the world everywhere. The Leader of the Opposition is on an obstructive mission. Like his Senate colleagues, he likes to stop everything. That is precisely what he is doing and is going to do as long as he possibly can. We do not fall for that proposition, nor for the phoney arguments of the Country Party, the great defenders of the rural people. They do not want money for roads; millions of dollars they do not want. They want to hold it up for every possible moment. Those who sit opposite and cry about the poor people and exploitation and the economy, today do not want us to discuss trade practices; they just want to put up their phoney propositions of censure on the Government. </para>
          <para>The worst feature of this is that the Opposition came here this morning and was not prepared to move a motion of censure of the Government. If that is the case, do honourable members opposite mean to say they are going to try to stop this being debated all day by the obstructionist tactics they are going on with? The situation is, and you well know it opposite, and so does the Leader of the Opposition, that you did not have the courage today to move a censure motion on this Government because you knew it is supported by only two-thirds of your members. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member says nonsense. He is lucky to be talking to his Leader. They have met only since they came back and the Opposition met. So what would he know about what the Leader, of the Opposition is thinking? I suggest to the people of Australia today that this Parliament has been called together for one purpose, to discuss trade practices, national roads and all that goes with them. I suggest to members opposite, if they are fair dinkum in their approach to problems, that it is nearly time they got their members to attend. They have had plenty of notice. To come forward with phoney censure motions after this Government has had to intimidate you also into taking action, and then want to move it when you gave notice of it for another day, you really do not know where you are going at any stage. The situation therefore is that we object to this motion. We shall not support it and it will be opposed when the vote is taken. </para>

            <para>-You may not think so but he is a Minister, and at the table a moment ago he described this motion as a motion of censure. He did this on more than one occasion. Furthermore, he said that it had been moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> in answer to his challenge to move a motion of censure. Therefore it has been accepted as a motion of censure. I want to refer to the reason for the wording of standing order 1 10. 1 think the reason is perfectly plain. The reason for the wording is that there may be moved a motion which is not formally a motion of censure and which is not a motion of censure in form but which nevertheless implies censure, and if a Minister accepts such a motion- shall we say a motion about turtles or something like that- as a motion of censure, it becomes a motion of censure. This has been the procedure in this House on many occasions in the past when, for example, governments have fallen when defeated in a motion for the adjournment of the House. They have accepted defeat on an adjournment motion as a motion of censure. If a Minister describes any motion as a motion of censure it becomes what in political terms is known as a hanging matter and if the Government is defeated on such a motion it is duty bound to resign. </para>

            <para>-My friend the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> reminds me that the Scullin Government fell on a motion for the adjournment of the House. This is something which is quite common not only to our Parliament but to the House of Commons also. A Minister can accept any motion on any matter, however trivial, as a motion expressing censure and, if the Minister so accepts it, a government defeated on that motion is in honour bound, and I think constiutionally bound, to resign. But, if a motion expresses censure verbatim, as the motion that was before the House does, its recognition as such by a Minister in terms of standing order 1 10, obligates the House to dispose of it before it embarks on any other business. These words are perfectly plain. There is no doubt in my mind as to what they mean, why the standing order has been drafted in those terms and what it implies. </para>

The Minister described it as such. He used the words &#39;motion of censure&#39;. Furthermore, the motion was moved in answer to a challenge by the Minister to move a motion of censure. It was accepted and recognised as such verbatim by the Minister at the table. On more than one occasion, as Hansard will show, he described it as a motion of censure. </para>

            <para>- He not only accepted it but also accepted it verbatim by describing it as a censure motion. The text of Hansard will show that he so described it. But it is not necessary to go to the text of Hansard in this case because the motion of censure was moved in response to the challenge which the Minister issued at the table. He said: &#39;Will you move a motion of censure? You do not dare to do so&#39;; whereupon the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> did exactly that. The motion was moved in answer to a challenge. The challenge was accepted and the acceptance was recognised by the Minister, who described it as a motion of censure. As I have said- I have gone back into the history of this- it is possible for a Minister to accept a motion of censure and to describe as a censurable thing a mere trivality such as the adjournment of the House or a mere matter of procedure. If it does, then the motion becomes a motion of censure. But, when it is, verbatim, a motion of censure and when a Minister has recognised it as such, this kind of ambiguity does not arise. The conditions precedent in standing order 1 10 have all been satisfied. Notice has been given of intention to move a motion; it is a motion of censure verbatim; and it has been recognised as such by the Minister at the table. I do not think there is any need for me to labour the point. </para>

            <para>-It has been suggested, although I think it is perhaps unnecessary, that we should check the tapes. I do not think that this is necessary. In the past Hansard has refused the Minister&#39;s pressure to falsify the record, and I do not see why it should not do so again. I will trust Hansard. I think that the Minister has burned his fingers once and that he will not try it again, however dishonest he may or may not be. It appears to me to be unnecessary to check the Hansard tapes. The Minister has described it as a censure motion. Really, even this was not necessary because notice of the censure motion was given in answer to the Minister&#39;s own invitation which was made at the table. The case is perfectly clear. </para>

            <para>- I take up the Minister&#39;s interjection. Apparently he considers that the Opposition&#39;s efforts this morning to have a debate on the economy are a waste of time. The point is that we are talking now about the definition of acceptance&#39;, as I understand it, and this is related directly to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> Standing order 1 10 states quite clearly that once a Minister accepts a motion of censure it takes precedence. Many honourable members, including myself, were in the House when the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> clearly indicated his recognition of the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition as a motion of censure. So, as I understand it, what we are debating now is whether recognition of a notice of motion of censure, which was clearly done by the Leader of the House, constitutes acceptance of the motion. In view of the importance of this special sitting of the House and the opportunity it provides to have a full debate on the economy, I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, to</inline> reconsider your interpretation- because that is what it amounts to- of whether recognition of a notice of motion, which I think everybody agrees has happened, is an acceptance of the motion. </para>

            <para>- It is not a long speech. With too many price fixing and other restrictive arrangements in this country which are working in the wrong direction as far as efforts to counter inflation are concerned, it is desirable that the legislation be brought into operation with minimum delay and that these practices be stamped out. Some of the provisions prohibiting restrictive trade practices will not become effective until 4 months after the commencement of the legislation, but price fixing arrangements will be prohibited from the outset. The Government has made it clear that it is quite prepared to give close consideration to and, where appropriate, to accept amendments that will improve this Bill. Our objective throughout has been to obtain the best possible law because it has to be a law which is effective, yet at the same time not provide unnecessary problems for industry. </para>

        <para>A number of amendments were made to the Bill in the Senate. Some of these were moved by the Government, and some were moved by the Opposition. There was a large measure of acceptance of the amendments in the Senate, and the amendments leave the basic structure of the Bill intact. They largely concern matters of refinement or further clarification of the meaning of particular <inline font-style="italic">provisions.</inline> The following are among the matters dealt with by the amendments: The commencement provision is changed to provide a 4-month staging in period for the price discrimination provision and to make the prohibition of price fixing agreements effective from the date of commencement of the legislation. Changes are made in the restraint of trade provision in clause 45 in regard to the onus to be borne in determining whether an agreement is outside the prohibition by reason of its insignificant effect on competition. A new provision is included in the monopolisation provision, clause 46, to assist in determining whether a corporation is in a position substantially to control a market for the purposes of that provision. A change is made in clause 76 to emphasise a stricter standard of proof, appropriate to the nature of the proceedings, and the penalty provided will operate in proceedings for pecuniary penalties. A new defence is provided in clause 85 for a natural person- but not for a corporationwhere the person acted honestly and reasonably and in the court&#39;s view ought fairly to be excused. A new provision- clause 156 A- is included providing for disclosure to a party, by the Commission, of documents that tend to establish the party&#39;s case. The remaining amendments are mainly of a technical or drafting nature. The amendments are acceptable to the Government, and I have moved that the Committee accept them so that the Bill can become law. </para>
        <para>I conclude my remarks by saying that I am sure that my honourable friend will share my view that Australia has been without effective anti-restrictive trade practice legislation for a very long time, for one reason or another. Two of those reasons have been legal challenges in the courts and pressure on governments- previous governments and this Government- by strong, powerful, vested interests. The proposals for a stronger effective law came, in modern times, as long ago as 1962 when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick began to espouse the need for legislation of this kind. But for one reason or another it was not forthcoming. Ineffective legislation was produced in 1965. The genesis of this Bill, which we hope will become law today, was in September of last year when the original Bill was introduced by the Whitlam Labor Government. I am sure that all honourable members will agree that in the fight against inflation any legislation which is effective, strong and workable will play a very important part. Some history of significance is being made today when, as we hope, this Bill becomes law. </para>

          <para>-This legislation on trade practices, when it passes into law, as it may well do later today or tomorrow, will not cure inflation. It will not have any real effect on inflation. The Opposition, in a constructive way, either will agree to or will not oppose some of the amendments which are before the Committee. The fact is that the Government brought in this legislation last September, as the Minister for Manufacturing Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Enderby)</inline> has said. At that time the Government forced this legislation through the House. The legislation then came before this House early in November, and at that time it was again sought to bring reason to bear on the Government so that the legislation might be considered in a reasonable atmosphere. Unfortunately, that was not to be and finally the legislation was forced through this House. We know that the history is that by April this year it was brought back and introduced into the Senate. We know that on that occasion it came back with some 110 amendments and that those 110 or perhaps more amendments were the result of consideration of the Bill by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> in the light of matters brought up by the Opposition. When this Bill came before the House again in July it was debated and we suggested again quite a number of amendments. There are 24 amendments before this House today and, of those, some 18 or 19 were proposed in this House and opposed by the Government at the time. The Bill then went to the Senate, it was debated, and the Government then accepted those amendments. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Two or three amendments, particularly those relating to clause 76 of the Bill, cause the Opposition some concern. It will appear to honourable members if they look at the Bill that that provision relates to the onus of proof in proceedings brought by the Government to recover penalties. Those penalties can amount to up to $250,000. The Opposition took the view, and still takes the view, that it is fair enough that in such proceedings there be proof beyond reasonable doubt of any particular breach. The Government resisted that and finally was forced to amend clause 76 in such a way as to require strict proof. By that we understand the Government to mean proof beyond reasonable doubt. Apparently the Government still wishes this question to remain in a state of doubt so that the courts will have to consider it. In other words, although the Government appears to agree with us in principle it insists on a clause which will not clarify the matter at all. We will not oppose those particular provisions. As to the others, we will agree with them. The particular ones to which I refer are those numbered 14, 15 and 16. </para>
        <para>The Minister has referred to the fact that we have had trade practices legislation for some time. We on this side of the house do not agree that that legislation has not been effective. One has only to read the reports of the Commissioner of Trade Practices to realise what effect it has had. Indeed many of the pricing agreements in this country have already been brought to heel and the fact is that, due to that, this proposed Act, when it comes into force, will have little effect on inflation and prices. The fact is that those in industry who have price fixing agreements have adjusted under the old Act. I draw the attention of honourable members to the report of the Commissioner of Trade practices which was tabled in this House in July this year. There has up to date been effective legislation. There have been constitutional challenges- they were necessary- and, may I remind the Minister, they were undertaken by the previous Government. It was the previous Government that established before the High Court the wide powers under the corporations power in relation to trade practices. If it had not been for the fact that the previous Government persisted with the validity of that legislation and made it the basis of the Resale Price Maintenance Act, this Government would now be floundering in a constitutional bog instead of being in a position where it can go ahead with the feeling that this legislation has a great deal of constitutional validity behind it. We will support the amendments other than those numbered 14, 15 and 16. As to those, we will not oppose them. </para>

        <para class="block">It will be recalled by honourable members that I introduced the National Roads Bill 1974 into the House of Representatives on 18 July of this year. Although the Bill was passed by the House of Representatives, 4 amendments were subsequently made to it in another place. In the interests of furthering the passage of this important legislation through the Parliament the Government is prepared to accept 2 of those amendments. I shall address myself to them at a later stage. However, the Government is not prepared to accept the first 2 amendments, which relate to the power of the Minister for Transport to declare a road an export road or a major commercial road. The amendments are to sub-clause (3) of clause 4 and to sub-clause (4) of clause 4. Those amendments, if accepted, would have the effect of requiring the Minister to obtain the agreement of a State before declaring &#39;export&#39; or &#39;major commercial &#39; roads. </para>
        <para>Honourable members will know from a reading of the Bill that an export road is one which facilitates trade and commerce or the development of trade and commerce with other countries and that a major commercial road is one which facilitates trade and commerce or the development of trade and commerce among the States. As I understand it, the reason for these proposed amendments is because, unlike national highways which are substantially roads connecting capital cities, export and major commercial roads are usually interstate roads. Surely this reasoning does not go to the heart of the matter. </para>
        <para>The Government is providing 100 per cent of the finance for these roads- the Opposition is not disputing this- because it believes they are truly of a national character. Of course they are geographically located within each State, but surely the important consideration here relates to their purpose and not where they happen to be located. We are all familiar with the great need that exists for the development of these types of roads. Anyone who has travelled from the city to Sydney airport, particularly in the peak hours, will only too readily recognise the congestion that exists there. Roads to ports in many of our cities are similarly congested and thus contribute to the delay in loading and clearing cargo in these areas. </para>
        <para>In the second reading speech I made when I first introduced the National Roads Bill into the House of Representatives I indicated the general outline of the routes which the Government intended to designate as national highways. 1 did not, however, do that for export or major commercial roads. That is because the Government will, in fact, be consulting with the State governments on the most suitable roads for declaration. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has already written to the then Acting Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Cutler, in this respect, seeking his co-operation with regard to discussions between Australian Government Ministers and New South Wales Government Ministers on the possibility of some of the Botany Bay access roads falling within the export road category, thereby making them eligible for the whole cost of their construction and maintenance to be borne by the Australian Government. If I may, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> I would like to quote the final paragraph of a letter written on 5 June by the Prime Minister to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Cutler, the then Acting Premier of New South Wales. The letter deals with things other than roads. In it the Prime Minister said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I also understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Neilson&#39;s</inline> report includes proposals for access roads to Botany Bay. As was indicated in February when the Queen opened Parliament, the Government will be bringing forward a new road program which will place emphasis on national highways, including interstate highways and export roads. Perhaps our Ministers could discuss the possibility of some of the Botany Bay access roads falling into the export road category. If they were accepted, this would then make them eligible for their whole cost to be borne by the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>-Fuehrer. It is easier to pronounce. But, all jokes aside, whilst there have been many claims from the States that the Australian Government is centralist, this is patently not true because the things we are doing are a clear indication that we are prepared to negotiate, to talk and to have discussions with the States. We have already done that. Many of these things such as conferences and discussions were undertaken long before the Senate made its amendments. I believe that this is a clear cut case of misunderstanding and probably misinterpretation of how far we wanted to go. Under the 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Act the definition of &#39;urban arterial road &#39; reads as follows: &#39;Urban arterial road&#39; means a road or a proposed road in an urban area that is for the time being declared by the Minister to be an urban arterial road, or an urban sub-arterial road, for the purposes of this Act. </para>

            <para>-They are disbelieving souls. In fact, I believe that these definitions were written in by the honourable member&#39;s predecessor, the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair).</inline> So all we did in drafting the Bill was to write in those things which were in previous pieces of legislation which have been acceptable to the States and which have been workable. Therefore, we thought that this was the easy way out of the situation. In the Government&#39;s view there is no difference in principle between the declaration of an &#39;export&#39; road, or a &#39;major commercial&#39; road and those which the Minister was able to declare without the States&#39; agreement when the Opposition was in power. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In summary the position is this: The Government believes &#39;export&#39; and &#39;major commercial&#39; roads are important in the national interest. In anticipation of the passing of the legislation we have already sought the views of the States on possible declarations of roads under these categories. All we ask is that the declaration of these roads be on the same basis as other roads already included in this Bill, that is national highways, roads covered by the Roads Grants Bill and the position under the 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Act. </para>

          <para>-The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> said that he prefers to be referred to as a Fuehrer rather than a Czar. Be that as it may, it seems to me that he is like Napoleon because he has just made the greatest retreat since Napoleon retreated from Moscow. The fact is that he has backed right away from the position he took. He went out on a limb but then produced an axe to chop that limb off. As a result he fell crashing to the ground. The Fuehrer across the table is just like the last Fuehrer of history, Adolf Hitler. The analogy can be drawn that whereas Hitler was attacked by bombs in his underground shelter, the Minister at the table has been bombed by telegrams from the States and from local government authorities telling him that they did not like the legislation. Under the weight and fusillade of telegrams and protests from local government associations around Australia- I might say that this was well organised by those associations and my congratulations go to them- the Minister, like his predecessor the Fuehrer of Germany, crumbled. This is the first reason we are back here today. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second reason we are back here today is that the so-called obstructionist Senate, about which the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> was so pleased to talk earlier, has done its job by democracy, the nation, the State governments and local government bodies throughout Australia. Local government bodies ought to recognise now, if they had not done so before, just how important it is that the Senate be as it is and not controlled by the Labor centralists and socialists of this nation who are trying to destroy our democratic system through a process of anarchy. </para>
        <para>With those few preambles, let me come back to the legislation. I was delighted that the State governments responded as vigorously as they did to the legislation. The Ministers for Transport in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland let the Minister know exactly what they thought of the legislation. I was disappointed that the South Australian Minister did not join the band. However, I quote some words of the South Australian Minister who said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If you think that we are going to let you tell us how much money we have to raise and how we are to spend it even down to local government level you had better have another . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I delete the expletive-  think about it. I tell you straight Charlie this is not on. </para>
        <para class="block">Those very famous words with all the expletives deleted- and there is a page and a bit of what was said- came from the South Australian Minister. This was part of a very public telephone conversation between the Minister for Transport and the South Australian Minister. The Minister for Transport was told in the bar of Parliament House- and about 8 witnesses were presentexactly what the South Australian Minister thought about him and his legislation. The point is that the position taken by the Opposition in the Senate following the position taken by the Opposition in the House of Representatives is supported not only by so-called conservatives and tories around Australia but by the radical Labor Minister for Transport in South Australia. If the Minister would like the conversation to be incorporated in Hansard I will seek leave for that to be done. There are quite a few expletives deleted. There was &#39;(Expletive deleted) drongo, (expletive deleted) this&#39;- all referring to the </para>
        <para>Minister. It just shows that, away from this ivory tower, the people of Australia recognise that the Senate did its proper job. The Senate did it with this Bill just as it did with the Trade Practices Bill. The proof of that is that the Minister has accepted the amendments. </para>

            <para>-That is right. We accept the position that the Minister has adopted on this motion. The Opposition will not oppose the Minister&#39;s suggestion that we disagree with those amendments. That is a different position from the one we took in the first place because since then the Minister has fully explained the details of the Bill. The whole position would not have arisen if in his second reading speech the Minister had explained exactly what the clauses were all about. If one turns to the Minister&#39;s second reading speech one will see that it is a political speech, loaded with political dynamite- perhaps &#39; bull dust &#39; is a better expression, if I may use such an unparliamentary expression. The fact is that, had the Minister come in here with a straight declaration, an exposition or explanation of what each of the clauses meant, we would never have reached this position. Clause 4 sub-clauses (3) and (4) commence as follows: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Opposition sought to include the words &#39;enter into an agreement with a State to &#39; after the words &#39;the Minister may&#39;. My advice- this did not come from the Minister&#39;s second reading speech- is that the criteria on which a road would be declared are laid down in the clause and therefore a State is now in a position to challenge should the Minister go in, willy-nilly, declaring roads throughout Australia with no guarantees to the States. So the States are left in a much stronger position than was explained in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. Therefore the Opposition does not oppose the amendment. </para>

          <para>- The Committee is debating a message from the Senate which seeks certain amendments to the Australian Government&#39;s National Roads Bill. I believe that this Government is making a genuine effort to meet the views of the Opposition as expressed in the amendments sought by the Senate. The Government is prepared to make concessions and to compromise in an effort to get the funds allocated by these Bills to the States, the shires and the councils. The Government does not want to see this legislation- and therefore the provision of funds- delayed or jammed any longer in this Parliament. </para>

          <para>-I am delighted that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> has seen fit to accept this amendment that I moved originally in the House and which the Senate agreed to. I am concerned to hear the Minister say that this precludes any future growth centre being declared. I find that an extraordinary statement. I do not believe it. If the Australian Government is going to try to pretend that clause 6 (b) will preclude the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, who has his own constitutional authority and power, from declaring a region fit to be a growth centre, I think we have reached the highest point of plain ridiculousness that I have ever heard. I do not believe the Act in any way derogates the power of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. I think it is nonsense for the Minister to try to pretend it does. Do not tell me that the administrative arrangements of this Government are so confused that it cannot even sort itself out. That was the point in moving the amendment in the first place. </para>

        <para>I am pleased the Senate once again agreed to the amendment because otherwise the States would find themselves in an extraordinary position of not knowing who is king of the roads as a result of legislation going through this House. The Czar has been routed. Now he is crying poor mouth and saying we are blocking Government legislation. It is absolute nonsense to pretend that this will stop future declaration of growth centres throughout Australia or the building of roads associated with them. The Government can make its own simple administrative arrangements as previous governments have done historically down through the years. I am pleased that the Senate has again proved its real worth to the nation by instituting these amendments. I hope that the people of Australia know exactly what it does. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jones)</inline> will clarify his position. There will be a consultative role with the States and I have made my position clear in this regard. There may be some technical details to be sorted out. The administrative arrangements within the Australian Parliament and with regard to the Australian Government are clear on our side. The Minister for Transport and myself, together with our departments, work in very close co-operation, unlike what was probably the chauvinism that existed under the previous Government. The situation that the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> forgets is that there has been a revolution in urban and regional affairs. Nothing was done in that field by the former Government for 23 years. We believe that you cannot deal with matters of transport, housing and land use without taking into account their inter-relationship and inter-connection. That is why the Minister for the Environment and Conservation <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass),</inline> the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson),</inline> the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in our Government, and their departments, have worked particularly closely together. I want to remind the honourable member for Gippsland, who was the Minister for Shipping and Transport in the previous Government, of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> the present Minister for Transport, stated on this matter during the last discussion at the Committee stage. He said that when Ministers in the previous Government produced legislation, including measures relating to beef roads, they permitted concurrence. Of course, our predecessors had no policy on urban and regional affairs. Therefore, they would not want any such legislation, could not understand any such legislation or any reasonable position when we introduced such legislation. But we will not delay the passage of this legislation just because the role I was to play has been deleted from it. As Ministers, we have agreed to work together as a team and we have our guidelines set down. We are not unhappy at all with our position. </para>

I think that it is important that I do this because I am certain that the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> has completely misunderstood what I said. Clause 6 (6), as originally drafted, provided for the Minister to undertake, in concurrence with the approval of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, road works in the growth centres of Albury-Wodonga and other such places that were so jointly declared- and I emphasise these next 6 words- &#39;for the purpose of this Act&#39;. The Senate amendment has had the effect of precluding any such growth centres being declared, along with Albury-Wodonga. So that is the position for the purposes of this Act. That is all I am talking about. I am not talking about some other Act. I am talking about this measure that we are  dealing with at the moment, namely, the National Roads Bill. </para>

There was one other aspect with which I wish to deal. An amendment of particular significance that the Government has accepted is that which deletes the words &#39;or an officer authorised by the Minister&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> you will recall that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> could have given the power to a delegated public servant to override decisions taken by the elected State governments or the elected local government bodies throughout Australia. That was a particularly objectionable part of this Bill to which we were opposed. I am delighted now that such an officer no longer has that power and that the Commonwealth can now enter into proper consultation with the States. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One other point needs to be made. During his remarks the Minister for Urban and Regional Development got on his high horse, as we are accustomed to seeing him do these days. I simply say this: The Opposition has a much better and more clearly defined approach to problems of urban and regional development that has the Minister. What we need to have from the Minister is a clear definition of what he is after. He goes from one State to another making statements like this: &#39;I am going to buy back the Dandenongs; I am going to do this, in the La Trobe Valley and I am going to do this out of Sydney.&#39; The Minister should put his money where his mouth is and do something. He is making a mess of Albury-Wodonga and pity help the States in having to deal with him as Minister on this matter. </para>

        </motion>
        <para>Honourable members will recall that I introduced the Road Grants Bill 1974 into this House on 18 July. As did the National Roads Bill, it passed this House but has been amended in another place. Eight amendments were made to the Bill and the Government is prepared to accept these amendments as they apply to all categories of roads in the Bill, with the exception of 2 amendments as they apply to urban arterial roads. The Government cannot accept that the requirements of the original clause 4, sub-clause ( 1 ) and clause 1 1 should not still apply in respect of urban arterial roads. Clause 4, sub-clause (1 ) as we now propose will enable the Minister for Transport to require a State or local government authority to submit for approval a program of  urban arterial roadworks which would include works financed from its own resources. Clause 1 1, as we now propose it, would apply only to urban arterial roads. I made it clear in a statement issued prior to the debate on this Bill in another place that clause 4 was not mandatory and would be applied only in a restricted sense. It remains the intention of the Government that the Minister&#39;s power under clause 4, sub-clause 1, should apply only to urban arterial roads. It is therefore proposed that this sub-clause be amended to give effect to this intention. </para>
        <para>Honourable members will know that the Australian Government is giving high priority to the objective of improving the quality of life in the cities and in particular to substantially improving public transport. The proper development of urban arterial roads is extremely important to achieving this objective because much of urban public transport, taxis and buses in particular, run on these roads. An important type of urban arterial road is the freeway. These have become the centre of controversy in every State capital city. A special report recently prepared by the Bureau of Roads identified many advantages of freeways over heavily laden arterial roads. These advantages include very significant reductions in road accidents, decreases in the operating costs of commercial and private vehicles, savings in travel time and reductions in air pollution, noise, community disruption and very substantial improvements in route times for public transport. </para>
        <para>On the other hand, the report found that most Australian capital cities have a radial pattern of railways and roads emanating from the centre of the city. The difficulty with this pattern is that as roads and railways approach the centre of the city the distance between them becomes less and less and the volume of traffic per lane increases. The inner areas are, as a result, polluted by noise and congestion and are dissected into areas which are too small to act as true communities. It is these latter aspects of freeway development that are a matter for considerable concern. It is a fact that enough consideration is being given to the social and environmental aspects of freeway development. People living in many inner areas of our larger cities are finding their houses uprooted for freeway development without due care and consideration being paid to their needs </para>
        <para>This Government will not tolerate this state of affairs. As a Government we are not prepared to agree to the States using grants for freeways which they believe will be acceptable to us, but then use their own moneys to build unacceptable freeways. If this situation is allowed to prevail many of the problems associated with future freeway planning will continue and the Australian Government will be indirectly aiding and abetting the situation. The Bureau of Roads in its report found that a number of freeways being built were unacceptable in that they did not comply with the principles of proper development of the Bureau which the Bureau defined as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In Outer Areas: </para>
          <para>Freeways should follow a grid pattern. They should move traffic around the built-up areas. They should provide links between sub-regional centres or system cities. </para>
          <para>In Middle and Outer Suburbs: </para>
          <para>Freeways should be encircling or bypass freeways. They should separate inter suburban traffic from local traffic. </para>
          <para>They should provide fast routes for goods and passenger transport to bypass inner suburbs and the  CBD </para>
          <para>In Inner Suburbs: </para>
          <para>Radial freeways should not be provided for work trips to CBD </para>
          <para>There may be justification for freeways in these areas for moving large volumes of traffic, particularly heavy commercial traffic, around or away from CBD or its adjacent suburbs. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline>those definitions come from the Bureau of Roads report. The Bureau included as unacceptable the future development in the inner areas of Sydney, of part of the north western freeway, the extension of the Warringah freeway to Willoughby, and the western, southern and eastern freeways. The Bureau considered that all of these should not be given priority in the road improvement programs for Sydney. In Melbourne the position in regard to inner city freeways is not so bad. The Government there, under electoral pressure before the last State elections, in inner areas removed many of the freeways that were then not acceptable. </para>
        <para>Turning to pollution generally, this is a matter of considerable concern to all of us. Honourable members may well ask why the evidence available is, to say the least, disturbing to anyone concerned with living conditions in our major cities. For example, average carbon monoxide levels taken over an 8-hour period in Sydney reached as high as 49 parts per million compared with a maximum of 9 parts per million recommended as long term goals by the World Health Organisation. Similarly there were recordings in Sydney of . 1 7 parts per million of petrochemical oxidants as compared with World Health Organisation recommendations of .06 parts per million. There is less information available about other capital cities. But, again, the information that was available suggested that problems of petrochemical smog and the like either existed or could be expected to emerge. </para>
        <para>The National Health and Medical Research Council had examined the available data on air quality in Australia. The Council had agreed that in order to achieve and maintain satisfactory quality for health needs it would be necessary to take more action to reduce vehicle emissions. There is too much at stake in regard to freeways to leave the States to their own decision making. Australia can still avoid many of the mistakes made in the United States in regard to freeways. The experiences of the American city of Los Angeles were illuminating in this respect. At one time Los Angeles had the largest suburban rail system in the United States but because of years of neglect this system was allowed to run down, until by 1961 no more suburban passenger services were provided in that city. Los Angeles has from that time relied on a system of freeways to provide the backbone of its transport system. More than 450 miles of freeways have been built. However, whilst this may be a superb engineering achievement, it does not provide the sort of transport system which serves the needs of all members of the community. Those without the means to afford cars- the young, the old and the poor- were ignored by the system. In addition, the people of Los Angeles now realise that freeways cause other problems. Because of this experience the city of Los Angeles has turned again to public transportation so that it may breathe some life into its choking city. It has reestablished a transit authority which is now engaged on the planning and building of a new rapid transit system. </para>
        <para>The Australian Government is determined that the public transport systems of the Australian cities will not suffer the same decline that such systems suffered in cities like Los Angeles, with the consequent huge expenditure needed to re-establish a viable public transport system. The Australian Government&#39;s transport initiatives in the urban public transport area are designed to provide a better balanced transport system. Last year $32m was provided to the States for public transport. I am confident that more will be made available in future years to continue this initiative. Apart from the serious need to look at the social and environmental effects of freeway development, there is an important need to ensure that finances provided for urban arterial roads and urban public transport upgrading are closely co-ordinated. This can be achieved only if the Australian Government is in a position to ensure that urban arterial road development is properly planned in all its aspects. There is nothing to be gained if Australian Government grants are used on urban railway development and the </para>
        <para>States build competitive freeways alongside that development. Co-ordination of both these forms of transport is necessary, and this can be achieved only if the Australian Government is in a position to have the controls relating to urban arterial roads as envisaged in clause 4(1). The arguments in support of the Goverment&#39;s stand are overwhelming and I believe they have the support of the majority of people living in our cities. I trust that the Opposition will see the force of this and ensure that this Bill, as amended, is brought into operation as quickly as possible. </para>

          <para>- It is the wish of the Opposition to co-operate in this matter. The Opposition is delighted that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> should accept the modified amendment that was moved in the Senate. Just let me recount exactly what the Bill, as it read previously, did in respect of the powers of the central Government. The relevant clause would have given the Australian Government the right to call on every local government body and every State government throughout Australia to submit to Canberra any project involving the spending of money on road work or road maintenance. The most minor road work on which a shire in my electorate of Gippsland might need to spend money might have had to be submitted to the Federal Government for approval, even if the expenditure was from local ratepayers&#39; money. That is how ridiculous this Bill was in its original drafting. It is no wonder that the Minister was described as a tsar when he wanted such control. In his own words, he wanted to be described as a fuehrer sitting as a dictator over every bit of road construction and maintenance- even the erection of a road sign or the painting of a white line down the middle of the main street of Orbost where I live. That is how ridiculous this Bill was. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As I said, fortunately the Minister, as a result of the thousands of telegrams that bombarded him in his office downstairs, succumbed to the realities of life and realised that it is not a practicable proposition that the Australian Government should so control all roads. For that reason he has accepted the Opposition&#39;s amendment to take away the power of the Australian Government over local rural roads, rural arterial roads and local urban roads in the cities throughout Australia. The one area that is left is that covering urban arterial roads. I still have qualms about our accepting this amendment, except for one thing. I believe that the State goverment. and the State Ministers are powerful enough in their own right to resist the all-power dominance of the Australian Government. After listening to the Minister&#39;s speech a moment ago I can understand completely why the State governments, and the local councils in Melbourne and the cities generally, were nervous about this Bill. The Minister just gave us a treatise on how he, as the Fuehrer, would handle all roads in the cities throughout Australia. He does not do this in a spirit of co-operation; he does it in a very dogmatic, dictatorial and &#39;I am right and that is all about it&#39; sense. We want the Minister to do as the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> claims he does; that is, to co-operate with the States and local authorities in the cities in overcoming these problems. </para>
        <para>All wisdom does not reside in the Minister for Transport in Canberra or the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in Canberra, or in their departments. The fact is that a great deal of expertise has been built up by local authorities in the handling of this motor car problem in the cities of Australia. If the Minister for Transport thinks that he can go to Sydney or Melbourne and suddenly cure all their problems with a miserable Bill relating to urban transport, such as we saw come into this House a few months ago, he has another think coming. The fact is that he cannot do it. The Opposition accepts the amendment in order to expedite this Bill. But again I say that I am nervous about the attitude of the Minister for Transport in this matter. When similar legislation comes before us in 3 years time we will be looking at the history of the Minister&#39;s intrusion into local government matters in the cities of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I probably will be the Minister; so the States again will be able to look to me for co-operation, in the good old fashion style that we had, in getting these things cured. As for the Minister for Transport using the experience of Los Angeles and pretending that in 5 minutes he is going to solve the problem, I believe he has another think coming. It will take a great deal of co-operation with local government bodies, city authorities and the State governments to cure this problem. To pretend that all wisdom resides in the Minister for Transport in Canberra is nonsense. I think the Minister will find that out in due course. If he does not cure the problem he will be held responsible, and I will be the first to point the finger at him. We expect him to cure it and not just talk about it. He has been doing enough talking about this Bill. We expect this problem to be cured. One other aspect of this Bill needs to be tidied up. I will be moving an amendment to clause 3 of the Bill in order to confine the definition of urban arterial roads. This is involved in our acceptance of the amendment moved by the Minister for Transport. </para>

          <para>- Briefly, the point made by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> was that whilst this Bill was being debated in another place we made a statement clarifying the proposed authority of the Minister for Transport. This amendment conforms with that statement. The important principle that we are standing by is contained in clause 4(1) and clause 1 1 of the original Bill. We have accepted the clarification by the Opposition spokesman on transport matters, the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> but we are concerned basically with urban arterial roads and urban sub-arterial roads because it is on those highways where major traffic congestion and other problems have occurred. Both the Minister for Transport and I when in Opposition continually pointed out the social, economic and environmental aspects of the destruction of many areas through the upgrading of arterial roads and the building of freeways. For many years we have condemned the radial road systems of the States. They have destroyed many inner suburbs of both Sydney and Melbourne. This has been a consistent policy adopted by the Minister for Transport and me. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When we came into power we sought from the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads information as to whether there had been any study of the environmental, social and economic aspects of freeways. No study at all had been carried out during 23 years of mismanagement by honourable members opposite. From the Bureau&#39;s report we formulated our policies. The previous Government made money available to the States for projects which, in fact, destroyed completely some inner suburbs, particularly Carlton and Collingwood in Melbourne and Glebe and Leichhardt in Sydney. Now we are finding that even the middle class supporters of the Liberal Party in the northern suburbs of Sydney are opposing the extension of the Warringah Expressway. This legislation gives the Minister for Transport and the Australian Government authority over investment not only on inner city freeways but also on all freeways because each freeway must be judged on its merits. The honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock)</inline> was concerned that we should ever have the legislative power to do this; now he says that we have to do it by persuasion. But how can we persuade some people who are committed to dogma that was set down a quarter of a century ago? There are engineers who want to create monuments to themselves. It is for this reason that we have to determine a sane policy. We have to take into account the social, economic and environmental aspects of freeways. </para>
        <para>I welcome the rather regressive attitude of the Opposition in the past to inner city freeways and freeways generally. In some cases freeways are an asset to our transport system, but they have to be integrated into our overall transport pattern. Thank goodness that at last after so many years those dull brains on the Opposition benches are now recognising that we must control investment on inner city freeways and selected freeways in other parts of our cities. </para>

          <para>- In some ways I will do what has been done by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren),</inline> and that is to go beyond the specific clause that we have in front of us. I think that it is necessary to do so in order to put the matter in its total perspective. What needs to be understood by this Committee and by the persons outside this chamber who are concerned about expenditure on roads in Australia is the tremendous job that has been done by the Opposition in this chamber and by the Opposition in the Senate because if this Bill had gone through as it was presented to this chamber- and by the march of numbers the Government was determined that the Bill would go through in that form- quite clearly it would have been a bad Bill. The reason it is not a bad Bill, although it is not the best Bill, is because of the action that was taken by the Opposition in the Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am sick and tired of hearing tales about the Opposition in the Senate being obstructive. The fact is that the Opposition in the Senate is constructive. There has not been a single occasion on which a Bill that has been amended by the action of the Opposition in this House or by the action of the Opposition in the Senate has not become a better Bill. When the Trade Practices Bill was introduced into this chamber in the last session before the last Federal election, the Government said that the Bill had to be passed immediately. We were not prepared to be intimidated. When the Government reintroduced the Trade Practices Bill after the last Federal election it brought in the Bill with 109 amendments to it. As a result of the efforts of my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> and the Opposition in the Senate, a further 24 amendments were made to the Bill. So more than 130 amendments were made to the Trade Practices </para>
        <para>Bill, and it is a much better Bill than it was when it was first introduced into the Parliament. We were always in favour of stronger trade practices legislation, but without our efforts the Trade Practices Bill would have been a bad Bill. I have had enough of this obstruction talk. </para>
        <para>Now I come to the Roads Grants <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> There are 2 Bills dealing with roads. I remind honourable members that the Minister for Transport, when referring to the Roads Grants Bill, said: &#39;If you do not pass it as it is, there will be no money at all&#39;. We were supposed to be intimidated by that statement. We were not intimidated because we were determined to make it a better Bill. Now there is the prospect that this Bill will pass this chamber and then the Senate as a much better piece of legislation than it was when it was presented to the Parliament. The first point that needs to be made is that under the terms of the legislation as it was originally introduced, there was a belief by the Labor Government that all wisdom centred here in Canberra, and the Minister or his delegate was given certain powers.  His  &#39;delegate&#39; meant a public servant. Honourable members opposite do not have so much confidence in their public servants when they talk about the Treasury; in fact, they are making the Treasury the whipping boy for everything that they do wrong. Yet under this legislation as originally presented an unidentified person- a public servant- was going to have the right to supervise and audit the policy decisions of State governments and local governments. </para>

        <para class="block">Minister for DURD- the Department of Urban and Regional Development. We have heard him intrude in this debate and have learned what extraordinary views he has got about the road transport system in Australia and especially in the urban areas. Thank goodness that although he could come into the debate he cannot stand over poor Charlie Jones and make Charlie Jones do things that Charlie does not want to do. Charlie Jones has got enough pressure on him from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo</inline> of South Australia. We already know how many times &#39;expletive deleted&#39; occurred in the conservation between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo</inline> and Charlie. Actually what Charlie said to Al Grassby in Cabinet is rather like the language he used to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo</inline> during the telephone conversation that he had about this very matter. Liberal governments or Liberal-Country Party coalition governments, unlike Labor governments, are willing to stand up, be counted by their electors, take their decisions and answer for them. They do not believe that a public servant with a nice view overlooking Lake Burley Griffin knows how to control roads in Sydney, Parramatta, Carlton, Melbourne or anywhere else. We were determined to achieve that. We have achieved it. </para>
        <para>I want to pay public tribute not only to the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and his committee but also to every senator on the Opposition side who was prepared to take the criticism that was spread far and wide that they were being obstructive. I hope that the media, which said that they were obstructive, will now pay tribute to the Opposition senators for achieving a better Bill. It has been acknowledged not only by the Minister for Transport but also by other members of the Cabinet that it is a better Bill. The only person who has a different view is the Minister for Urban and Regional Development who has been left out.  His  own colleagues wiped him out. Poor old Tom, he has got no say in the matter, and I think that is of great advantage to the people of Australia. </para>
        <para>What we were determined to do was to take out this supervisory capacity which the public servant would have had. We know that the Minister for Transport would be too busy solving the problems of Tasmania to be concerned about roads through Carlton, Glebe, Leichhardt or wherever it might be. The Minister would have left it to the public servants. The Opposition was determined to take that provision out of the Bill. There are 4 categories of roads- the rural local, the rural arterial, the urban local and the urban arterial. The Government&#39;s sticking point is on urban arterial roads. It has abandoned its claim in the other 3 areas and I am glad about that. But the Government is still left with urban arterial roads. In relation to urban arterial roads it is perfectly clear that before the Government can do anything in that field or before it can obstruct things being done it has to have the approval of the State governments. In order to do something the Government has to have the agreement of the State governments. In that sense, it is a proper resolution of the problem. There will have to be a co-operative effort between the Commonwealth Government and State governments which is something for which we have always argued and which we have now achieved. </para>
        <para>If the Federal Government thinks that it can ride roughshod over the States it has another think coming. The States will not let it do so. </para>
        <para>We of the Opposition are committed to a federal system in Australia and believe there is a role for the States. We will stand with the State governments on this matter. On every occasion when legislation comes before this House, in our policy committees, in our joint shadow ministry and in our joint party room we examine each piece of legislation and ask: &#39;Is the principle offensive?&#39;. If the principle is offensive we ask the second question: &#39;Is it reversible when we get into government?&#39;. Those are the criteria on which we operate. We have so operated consistently and will continue to do so. In this case the principle of the Commonwealth still having a supervisory role over the States in relation to arterial roads in urban areas - </para>

          <para>- We will reverse the position when we come into office. The principle is bad. It is reversible. When we come into office we will reverse it. In the meantime the States have their power. If they choose not to co-operate with the Federal Government because the Federal Government is making errors the program will be at a standstill. There will have to be a reconciliation. That is what we want. We believe that State governments and local authorities are in a far better position to decide whether a freeway should go through a certain area and what should be the nature of the freeway. There has been a lot of emotional talk about freeways, such as that coming from the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> who talks about Los Angeles. Everybody knows that in Los Angeles the authorities went far too far. We can see what happened there and we can decide it will not happen in Australian capital cities. But to assume that the State governments will ipso facto make the same bad mistakes as were made there is nonsense. The fact is that the people who serve in State governments know exactly the feeling of the local community. They know also the need for transport in the local community. They can come to a proper reconciliation. That is the way it should be. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I make it clear that we do not accept as correct the statement by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> that freeways have destroyed Carlton. That is nonsense. I happen to know Carlton very well. I often have lunch there with my friends in the Italian and Greek communities. They are fine people who enjoy living in Carlton. Carlton is a suburb which is blossoming and blooming. We want it to do that. That is part of our policy and we will achieve it. But when the Minister suggests that the area is being destroyed by freeways he is only illustrating that he has never been there and has received wrong advice about it. We have to realise that there are a lot of people who need to get to their place of work, visit their friends, have social intercourse or whatever it is, who need traffic ways which will get them from point A to point B in a minimum of time in safety. That is our purpose. We do not want freeways to mar the landscape or the cityscape. We accept that progress must come, but there is no reason why progress must be ugly and must obstruct the natural advantage and development of Australian people. A reconciliation can come. If the Commonwealth provides money, fine. It needs to have a say in it, but it cannot have a veto power that enables it to say that the States are wrong and the Commonwealth will not let the States do what they want to do. </para>
        <para>This Bill is a much better Bill than it was when originally introduced. I pay tribute to the Minister for Transport for not being as obstinate as originally he sounded as though he would be. I also pay a tribute in advance for what I expect will be his course of action in relation to negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the States. Now that we have taken out of the Bill the provision about his delegate, the public servant, it is now his personal responsibility to reach reconciliation with the State governments. If he fails it will be his fault If there is no upgrading of urban transport it will be his fault, not the fault of the States. He has personal responsibility for it. Knowing the extreme responsibility that he has, I thank him in advance for the kindness that he will show in recognising that people in urban areas want rapid, safe transport. If he makes a mess of it the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and I will be on his wheel along with all States. We hope he will be able to approach his responsibility in a far more diplomatic way than he has approached so many of the industrial problems with which he has had to deal. </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman has asked me whether I disagree with his actions. The answer is yes, I do disagree because he shows himself to be a man convinced of his own lightness above all things. It was a strange departure for him in relation to this legislation. I congratulate him for it He will be a far better Minister if he continues to take this attitude in the future. </para>

            <para>-Of course honourable members opposite supported it. The then Government had a Bill that was not worth a peanut and had no teeth in it, because it was afraid that it might harm its wealthy supporters. But we put some teeth into it. That is why today it is a better Bill than the earlier Bill was. There was also a reference to an alleged conversation between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Geoff</inline> Virgo, the Minister for Transport in South Australia, and me. As to the eavesdropping that allegedly took place, once again the Leader of the Opposition handled the truth most carelessly. I cannot call him a liar, can I, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman?</inline> He handled the truth most carelessly. I did not indulge in bad language over the phone to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo.</inline></para>

            <para>-If he did, as among mates, I would take as much notice of it as I would if it were used by a lot of other people who are my friends. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> what we are concerned about and what we are trying to do in this Bill today is to act responsibly. We have due regard for the people. But the Liberal Party and the Country Party would go out of their way deliberately to lay them off and to sack them on the pretext that we are withholding money. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition is in this place today for one reason only: Because he is frustrated and disappointed that the amendments are not being rejected by us. He would have loved us to have rejected them and thereby put innocent people in the position of being laid off. </para>

        <para>Let us be quite clear about the matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> Before the amendments were debated in the other place I outlined very clearly the Government&#39;s attitude. I pointed out that we had no intention whatsoever of dealing with rural arterial roads, other rural roads, other urban roads or the minor traffic engineering and road safety improvements program, and that all we were concerned about were the freeways. It is for that reason that I will be accepting the amendment which is to be moved by the honourable member for Gippsland. All we are concerned about are the freeways. We are not concerned about urban local roads or rural arterial roads. So let us be quite clear on that. We are not backing off. These amendments are completely in conformity with our attitude. The only difference is that if the provisions which the amendments will amend had remained in their original form the Bill would have been easier to handle. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development and I have been mates for 20 years. We are still mates. We will continue to work closely together on this Bill. So let there not be any illusions. </para>
        <para>The Leader of the Opposition said that a miserable $32m had been provided last year for the upgrading of urban public transport. It is $32m more than the coalition parties opposite were prepared to make available when they were in government. During the 23 years in which they were in government they did not provide anything for the upgrading of urban public transport. They did not provide one cent for the upgrading of urban public transport. Despite that, the Leader of the Opposition had the audacity to come into this chamber this afternoon and talk about the &#39;miserable $32m &#39; that we provided last year. </para>

Honourable members opposite have talked about doing things. They could have acted when they were in government, but they did not. When the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and I were in Opposition we talked about doing something and we have done something since we came into government. That is the difference between those who sit on this side of the chamber and those who sit on the other side of the chamber. Honourable members opposite are gunnas&#39;.

        <para>The Leader of the Opposition made reference to the situation in Los Angeles. Of course, we know of the problems experienced in Los Angeles. I have experienced on a couple of occasions the smog that occurs there. I do not want to see any Australian cities experiencing the same conditions. For 23 years honourable members opposite did nothing about preventing Australia from experiencing the same conditions. They said that they were going to do something about it. As I said a moment ago, they are a team of &#39;gunnas&#39;. We have done something. That is the difference between honourable members opposite and members of the Government Party. For 23 years honourable members opposite did not even talk about it. For 23 years they did nothing about it. That is the difference between them and us. I am prepared to accept the responsibility if urban public transport is not improved. I am prepared to accept the responsibility for any charge in the future of not doing anything about it. But let me say that if the State governments will co-operate with the present Australian Government and if the State governments will allow the present Australian Government to expend money where it should be expended on their urban public transport systems the present Australian Government will do what it has set out to do, that is, provide a better system of public transport for the people of the cities of Australia. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">These 6 Senate amendments cover a number of matters. Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 delete the proposed role of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in relation to urban local roads and urban arterial roads, including the approval of selected individual projects coming under the latter category. Amendment No. 5 makes the revocation of approval of particular projects conditional on obtaining Senate agreement. Amendments Nos 6 and 7 remove the power of the Treasurer to advance funds to the extent that he is satisfied that such funds are required by the States and to obtain certain information in regard to the administration of the Act. The provisions covered by these amendments as originally drafted were logical. They were there to meet particular needs. However, we will not let their deletion prevent the legislation coming into operation as quickly as possible. It is in this spirit that we again agree to the amendments, knowing that this action will ensure the successful passage of the legislation and its operation. </para>

          <para>-Once again I am delighted that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> should be generous enough to accept the amendments which were moved in this House and which were passed in the Senate. The Roads Grants Bill is much clearer and much cleaner. There is much less administrative difficulty for all those people outside who have to work with the Department of Transport in the administration of its functions. The removal from the Bill of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development makes the position much simpler. At least now we know where the buck rests. As the Bill was previously drafted the States might have a proposition which would have to come to the Government. They would not be sure who would be in charge. When they read the Bill they would not have been sure whether they had to go to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development or his delegate or to the Minister for Transport or his delegate. At least the States know that the buck rests with the Minister for Transport. They can look to him for a solution. The Minister can be held politically responsible for his failures. As I said earlier, the administrative agreement between the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and their Departments is a matter for normal administration between departments. The difficulty between the 2 Ministers should not be enshrined in legislation. The State governments are not interested in whether it is the Minister for Urban and Regional Development or the Minister for Transport who is responsible. Therefore we want to see that the States know where to go and have the matter taken from there. I am also pleased to see that the Minister has accepted the amendment which removes the Federal Treasurer from this Bill. Clause 10 (1) (c) stated: . . . if the Treasurer so directs, as soon as practicable after such date as the Treasurer specifies, a statement in writing setting out such other information in relation to amounts expended or set aside for expenditure by the State on road works or in relation to expenditure by a municipal, shire or other local authority on road works, as the Treasurer specifies . . . </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">That was an extraordinary provision which gave the Federal Treasurer the right to intrude in the expenditure programs of every local government authority throughout Australia. Again I am delighted that the Minister has accepted the deletion of that provision. A more ridiculous proposition to involve the Federal Treasurer in such a situation could not be thought of or entertained. The Minister has been generous enough to accept that amendment. I wish he would be equally as generous in relation to the role which the Senate played in getting a good Bill. This is not a case of obstructionism. Nor, as the Minister claims in his letter which went to all local government bodies, is it a case of the Opposition frustrating the passage of this Bill. I have a copy of the letter which the Minister sent at public expense to all local government bodies throughout Australia. The Opposition wrote to all local government bodies too, but it did it at its own expense and not at public expense. I would like to quote what the Minister said in his letter. He stated: </para>

          <para>Although the Bills have passed through the House of Representatives without amendment they may be delayed in the Senate by the Opposition who are seeking substantial amendments.

        <quote>
          <para>These Bills are an integral part of the Government&#39;s overall policies for transport and urban development. The Australian Government must be more closely associated with decision making in these matters if it is to ensure that Australia&#39;s transport problems are dealt with properly. The Opposition is trying to stifle these initiatives even though all 3 levels of Government must participate in the solution of existing transport problems. In the short term, of course, their opposition can only lead to difficulties in the continuing provision of funds to local councils. </para>

        <para class="block">That is proven to be nonsense by the very action the Government has taken in accepting the amendments. </para>
        <para>The one point that I want to make clear- I make this not only to the Minister but to the Prime Minister as well- is the disappointment that local government bodies have expressed to me, and which I outlined in my second reading speech, at the level of funds being made available for the different categories of roads. The smoke screen put up by the Government in regard to national highways has not hidden from local government bodies the simple fact that the level of funds made available to them for their road making activities has been seriously depleted. One of the difficulties that we have as an opposition is that we are unable to redirect funds to the priorities that we believe are necessary or allocate more funds to these areas. We look forward to the day when we get back into government when we can make sure that local government bodies are properly treated in this area. I am delighted to see that we now have a much simpler Bill as a result of the Government accepting the amendments. </para>

I have indicated that it accepts them, I am always amused at the accusations and charges that are made about this dictatorial centralist Canberra Government.

            <para>-He did not squib it. He would have been elected if he had stood, have no fear about that. But he has had enough sense, like I had, to decide to get out because one cannot do the 2 jobs. But the honourable member could tell the Committee of his experiences in recent months of the standover tactics of the New South Wales Government in regard to the Newcastle City Council. The Council is concerned with 2 projects, one of which is still being held up as a result of the State Government&#39;s attempts to frustrate. This is a beautiful example of that centralist Sydney Government which dictates to the local councils and to the people of New South Wales. The honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> could tell the Committee the same story about the way the people of Wyong have been dictated to by the State Government. He could tell honourable members of the way in which roads are being built alongside schools. So do not let us start talking about dictatorial government. The New South Wales dictatorial Liberal-Country Party Government is as bad as any of them. So let us stop trying to pull one another&#39;s legs here today and get on with the job. We have a Bill to put through this place which is in the interests of the people of this country. </para>

In accordance with the Government&#39;s approach in limiting clause 4 ( 1 ) to urban arterial roads it is suggesting an amendment to clause 1 1 which has a corresponding effect. The acceptance of this amendment, together with that to clause 4(1), will put the Government&#39;s position on approving State and local government road programs beyond doubt. This amendment, if accepted, will confine the operations of this clause to urban arterial roads. When speaking to the first amendment I outlined at some length the Government&#39;s case on the need to be involved in decision making on urban arterial roads.

        <para class="block">The Opposition is concerned because it appears from our reading of the Bill that the Minister can, for any purpose at all, declare a road to be an urban arterial road, and that would prevent the State proceeding with any development it might have in mind for that road. To take a hypothetical case, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren),</inline> leaning on his friend the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> might say: &#39;I want all those roads through the Dandenongs declared urban arterial roads so that no progress can be made on the upgrading of the roads even though the local people may want it. &#39; That is an extreme case. It is highly unlikely. </para>
        <para>The amendment expresses the sort of concern we have as an Opposition. The Minister for Transport has been good enough to accept a closer definition of an urban arterial road. The acceptance of my amendment simply means that the States know full well that the road to be declared an urban arterial road now has to meet the criteria as laid down in the Report on Roads in Australia- that is, a Class 6 or Class 7 roadwhereas previously the Bill could have been read to include any urban local road that, for any reason, the Minister could declare to be an urban arterial road. I thank the Minister for his cooperation in accepting that amendment because I believe that it will overcome a lot of the fears presently held by the States. </para>

When the motion That the House do now adjourn&#39; is proposed the honourable member for Mackellar may rise to debate that question. When he rose previously the honourable member for Bonython moved that the question be put. When the honourable member for Mackellar rose in his place I assumed, naturally, that he was going to speak on the question that the House at its rising adjourn until 17 September. </para>

            <para>-I refer to Erskine May&#39;s &#39;Parliamentary Practice&#39;, 18th edition, page 144, under the title &#39;Obstructing Members of Either House in the Discharge of Their Duty&#39; and a later reference to the molestation of members while in the execution of their duties. Three or four days ago members of Parliament were advised by you that the Parliament would be sitting today. We were also advised through our Whips&#39; offices that there would be an airline strike from midnight last night until midnight tonight. For this reason all members of the Parliament endeavoured to be in Canberra last night. In Brisbane myself and seven Liberal and Country Party colleagues were confronted with a situation at the Brisbane airport where neither Trans Australia Airlines nor Ansett planes were departing for Canberra or Sydney. As a result of this, and the likely delays and our concern that we would not be here for the meeting of the Parliament we rang the transport officer in Canberra, who advised us later that the Minister now at the table, the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> had denied us special transport considerations. I then rang him, out of concern that eight members of this Parliament would not be able to be present. Eight members were being stopped from being present. I rang him personally and asked him in view of all the industrial strife presently with us in Australia if he would consider giving us 2 hire cars, if necessary, to take the party from Sydney to Canberra. The Minister has indulged in this conduct of contempt of the Parliament under the heading of molestation of members while in the execution of their duty because he refused the eight of us any consideration in relation to special transport being made available to get us here. I know that this afternoon a great number of us are returning on VIP flights. The section of May&#39;s &#39;Parliamentary Practice&#39; to which I draw your attention is on page 144. It says: </para>

              <para>- Nothing that the honourable member for Griffith has indicated to the House matches in any way the sections of &#39;May&#39; on which he is trying to rely. There has been no suggestion of obstruction in anything that he has said. If anything, there may have been a lack of facilitation but that is very far from obstruction. From his own record of the events nothing was done to prevent those members from making their own arrangements to reach here by exactly the same modes of transport as he wanted the Minister to supply. In the circumstances, it is improper that the House should allow the honourable member for Griffith to continue on the basis of a claim of privilege. </para>

              <para>- I will. I am sorry that in your mind, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I have not come to the crunch yet. I remind the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Berinson)</inline> that the Government was able to supply a VIP aircraft to take the young Russian violinist to Singapore. I cannot see why special concessions cannot be extended to us. </para>

          <para>What I am saying is that we were obstructed from getting here because we did not know where we were going, what time we were going to reach there or anything. We telephoned a request that, if necessary, cars be supplied to take us from Sydney to Canberra. Eventually we arrived in Sydney at about a quarter to ten. We were unsure, because of the industrial strife which presently racks this country, what tomorrow held. At that late hour we- 8 responsible members- decided that because the Minister would not help us we would put in the extra money ourselves and hire a car. The problem was that when we telephoned for hire cars we were told that one could not have one at the drop of a hat; one had to give more notice. Fortunately we were lucky. One car arrived at Canberra at 3.40 a.m. and the other at 4 a.m. The point is that, if because of the lateness of our arrival in Sydney no hire cars had been available, the Minister for Services and Property would have been a party to obstructing 8 Queenslanders from arriving for this sitting. Therefore, I suggest that he has committed a breach of privilege and is guilty of contempt. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to indulge in personalities. The fondness that the Minister for Services and Property holds for me is recognised and well known by all. It is reciprocated in our mutual admiration society. But the fact is that because of malice, bitchiness and smallmindedness his mind was clouded with small issues which prevented him from seeing the main issue; that is, the importance of ensuring that members who have been summoned to attend Parliament are able to arrive in time for the sittings. It is all right for him to stand up and to say from his Party&#39;s point of view that all the Labor Party members are here. But they had special information and knowledge. This is indicated by the fact that all except 2 Labor Party members were stopped from going overseas. I believe that one travelled to Noumea and was brought back. Further, they were told to come to Canberra on Wednesday night. Members of the Opposition did not foresee any situation such as that which occurred again yesterday. Otherwise, we in the Liberal and Country Party teams would have come to Canberra in the same way as members of the Labor Party did. </para>
          <para>We were told by the news services that there would be industrial strife in the airlines from midnight last night until midnight tonight. We all know that tonight we are going home in VIP aircraft because of industrial strife. It is impossible for members of this Parliament, or any Australian citizens, to predict with certainty what will happen next in Australia when 43,000 people have been on strike every single working day so far this year. I believe that in view of the situation the Minister should have extended this consideration to us. But instead he said no. My colleagues, the honourable members for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns),</inline> Ryan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drury),</inline> Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ian Robinson),</inline> Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodges),</inline> Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Millar)</inline> and Fisher <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann),</inline> were stopped from getting here. </para>
          <para>Let me refer to another case. My friends, the honourable member for Baker <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> and the honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> from South Australia, also are not with us today. The Minister for Services and Property has carried on frequently about the fact that Opposition members are not here and has said that this is an indication that they do not care. The fact is that in Adelaide last night the airlines offered only one seat on an aircraft to the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> who is the Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Boothby and the honourable member for Barker. Therefore those 3 honourable members had to make a decision as to which of them would take that seat. This is a further example of obstruction in preventing members from attending this Parliament. I hope that in the next few days when you consider the point I have raised, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you will recognise that the Minister for Services and Property has perhaps unconsciously- he has done it whether consciously or not- created a situation which constitutes a breach and contempt of the privileges of this Parliament. I know that you are a fair man and I know that you realise that I am a member of the Privileges Committee. If I did not believe that what I have stated constitutes a contempt of the parliamentary system I would not have bothered to raise this very vexed question. I am pleased that my 7 colleagues who travelled with me from Brisbane were conscientious enough in the middle of the night to make a decision to come to Canberra knowing that we would be arriving as the sun was rising. We made that decision because we have a duty to be here despite the obstructions which might be placed in front of us. </para>

              <para>- I just want to take the opportunity to reply to a few of the comments made by the invisible man. We heard today of an honourable member who could not get to the Parliament and we heard a speech of an honourable member who evidently is not here. So we have just heard the speech which was not made. Let me put the record straight. The situation is that last Monday, I think it was, a telegram was sent from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> to all honourable members advising them that this Parliament would meet today. Adequate time was given to honourable members to make preparations to come to this Parliament. Consequently Labor members, who have a most efficient and skilful Whip, were notified that Friday was the meeting day, that it was their responsibility to be here and that they should take into consideration matters which might arise in regard to transportation. Therefore, with their usual diligent attention to their parliamentary duties, Government members assembled in their masses without any special assistance from the Government in regard to transportation or anything of that kind. The fact that the Opposition has 2 crook Whips does not add to anything here. No special facilities were provided to Government members. They were all able to get here. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The situation now is that the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron)</inline> says that 8 Opposition members could not get here and were stopped from getting here. But every one of them is here today. I recollect that the honourable member did ring me and suggest that the Government might provide 2 hire cars to transport him and these 8 honourable members, whom he did not mention, from Sydney. The situation in the days of the Government which the honourable member for Griffith supported was that you could not get a car from the airport to the General Post Office or to come or go to the Parliament. Now, those things having been granted, he comes into this Parliament and criticises us for extravagance and the misuse of public funds. That is the contemptible approach he takes to the privileges of members. </para>
          <para>I told the honourable member that I was never receptive to ideas from him because I do not appreciate people who take all the generous things that can be given and then abuse that privilege, but if other honourable members were interested and I thought that they were respectable decent types, probably suggestions could be considered. I said to the honourable member that as he had had adequate time to make preparations to get to this place and as he left it to the last minute because he was too lousy to spend money for a bed for a night in Canberra, it was not the responsibility of the Government of the public purse. It is his responsibility to be here, 2 or 3 days early if necessary. I will give the honourable member the good oil: Whether the Parliament is meeting or not I am not going to pay for his lack of foresight or lack of ability to get here. I am not going to put the public purse to expense for that reason. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Griffith said that this was an attempt to prevent honourable members opposite from getting here. Who would worry about the honourable member being here? He talked about obstruction. By heavens, honourable members opposite would know all about obstruction. That is why we are here today. The Government has been obstructed. The honourable member was not obstructed from getting here. The very fact that he is here proves that he was only trying to get here the the cheap way, at the expense of the Government or the taxpayers. Today he brought up this matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> quite rightly described as just a grouch from somebody who left it too late to get here. The honourable member knew from the news services that there might be industrial trouble, that matters might go wrong, and things of that nature. Probably he could have got a lift in the VIP aircraft that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> uses, if he had asked him, because he has not been averse to asking the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> for that privilege from time to time. The honourable member was not entitled to special transport. Like every other honourable member he had a responsibility to do the things necessary to get here on the day. He received adequate notice and there was no reason why he and other honourable members could not have been here a day before, or 2 days before, as many honourable members on this side of the Parliament were. </para>
          <para>Another factor is involved in this matter. I know nothing of the people from Adelaide, the honourable members for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> and Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes).</inline> They did not approach me personally and I do not know what their problem was. But they also had plenty of time to get here. If they left it to the last minute that is their responsibility. The matter raised by the honourable member is an excuse by the Opposition because today it could only rake up 47 members to come to this Parliament. The honourable member has put up this excuse to cover what is a glaring example of their neglect of duties by honourable members opposite in respect of their attendance in this Parliament. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland)</inline> this morning read a long motion and said that this meeting of the Parliament was put on to catch the enemy, the Opposition, short. This meeting today was called because of obstruction by Opposition members in another place. This Parliament is meeting because of obstruction. We are here today because of the obstruction of people in another place. All the arguments of honourable members opposite will not hold water and honourable members opposite know it for the simple reason, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that we and everybody in the Parliament know that this Government gives to members opportunities to get here that were never given by other governments. In transport and other facilities they have never had it better. But I say, and it is not a threat but a statement of fact, that if the honourable member for Griffith continues to downgrade the facilities available to members of this Parliament and to endeavour to abuse them as he was going to do last night in order to get to this meeting of the Parliament, he cannot complain if the Government sees fit, in the interests of saving money and of restraint, to take a very strong approach to these matters and see that not one penny is wasted. </para>
          <para>It is an amazing thing that a member of the Opposition, a member of a party that is preaching restraint- his Leader is screaming from the housetops that things must be restrainedwanted 2 hire cars at public expense to come here to his well paid and easy job in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> like you I dismiss the charge made by the honourable member for Griffith and I suggest that if he wants to do his parliamentary duties he should get here on time.

            <para>- The answer to the right honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: ( 1 ), (2) and (3) Rottnest Island consists of some 1 800 hectares of which the Army currently controls some 50 hectares centred around Kingston Barracks. The area is used extensively for military training purposes, particularly by the Special Air Service Regiment and Army Reserve personnel. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition, a number of parcels of land previously under Army control and totalling 56 hectares was offered to the Western Australian Government in 1969 but the transfer did not eventuate because of differences of opinion on value. </para>
          <para>In June, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of Western Australia proposing, in respect of the areas originally offered in 1969, to dedicate them, subject to conditions to be mutually agreed upon, for tourism, park and recreational purposes to be vested in trustees under Section 54 of the Lands Acquisition Act. </para>
          <para>The Army occupied land continues to be required for defence purposes. However, the Prime Minister has asked the Premier for details of how the Western Australian Government intended to use the areas on Rottnest Island, including the areas occupied by the Army, and has proposed an indepth study, which would have regard to all interests involved, with the object of arriving at a mutually acceptable solution. A response from the Premier of Western Australia is awaited. </para>

              <para>The Public Service Board has advised me that it cannot readily provide this information as sick leave records are maintained solely by departments and are widely dispersed within departments.

            <para>The Merrett Rifle Range at Williamstown, Melbourne, continues to provide an essential training facility which is used extensively by the Australian Regular Army and the Army Reserve and Cadets as well as by the other Services and the Rifle Club movement. </para>
            <para>It is established policy to relocate the range but difficulty has arisen in identifying a suitable alternative site. The Prime Minister has been in correspondence recently with the Premier of Victoria and as a consequence it is expected that Australian Government and State Government officials will meet at an early date to investigate and report upon alternative sites. </para>
            <para>As opportunity permits, sections of the range are being released and last April the Department of Services and Property was authorised to negotiate with the City of Williamstown for the lease of 40 acres for recreation purposes. That area was additional to an area of 20 acres previously offered for the lease for the same purpose. </para>

While the Agreements refer to the &#39;two South Vietnamese parties&#39; (i.e. the Provisional Revolutionary Government and the Government of Vietnam), they do not do so on the basis of any assumption or stipulation that the two South Vietnamese parties have the same international legal status or are to be treated with strict equality by others. It is relevant that the International Conference on Vietnam held in Paris in March 1973 saw fit to include in its Final Act a penultimate sentence which read: &#39;Signature of this Act does not constitute recognition of any party in any case in which it has not previously been accorded. &#39; This was an important provision, required as much by North Vietnam, the PRG, the U.S.S.R. and China (in relation to their non-recognition of the Government of Vietnam) as by the United States, South Vietnam, France, Britain, Canada, etc. which do not recognise the PRG. </para>

The basic points taken into consideration every time a grant is made are: The standard of professionalism; the artistic potential of the person, group or organisation; the degree of artistic or community involvement; the extent to which the activity would benefit the community; the extent to which it would encourage participation in the arts or educate the young in the arts; and the extent to which it would promote Australia&#39;s cultural image abroad. </para>

            <para>Journalists are covered by 22 Federal awards. The Journalists (Metropolitan Daily Newspapers) Award is generally regarded as the parent journalist award and I have used it to determine the percentage increase in A Grade Journalists&#39; award wages since 1968.

            <para>Australia, South Australia and Queensland and $1 16.35 in New South Wales and Victoria. Since May 1974, the weekly rates have been $196.90 in Tasmania and $202.40 in all other States. The respective percentage increases, therefore, are as follows: </para>
            <para>New South Wales and Victoria-74.0 percent </para>

            <para>I should add that the differential between morning and evening weekly wage rates has been discontinued since 1968 and the above percentages are based on the 1 968 morning rates. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Many of the registered health insurance organisations presently provide benefits in respect of home nursing charges. The benefits provided range from 50 cents per visit up to reimbursement for the full amounts charged. Under the Australian Health Insurance Program, private health insurance organisations will be able to offer coverage against the costs of ancillary and allied health services provided by private practitioners. </para>
            <para>The Australian Government has decided that Government support in this area will be directed under the Program to organisations which provide services on other than a feeforservice basis. The Hospitals and Health Services Commission will be given the opportunity of recommending a program of financial support through Health Program Grants for organisations providing ancillary and allied health services through contract arrangements. </para>
            <para>In addition the domiciliary nursing care benefit, administered by my Department, provides financial assistance to persons who care for aged chronically ill relatives in their own homes. This benefit is designed to help meet the cost of nursing and other professional treatment involved in caring for the patient. </para>
            <para>I would also remind the honourable member that there is also a subsidy paid to qualifying non-profit home-nursing organisations through the Home Nursing Subsidy Act, which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Health. </para>

              <para>In reply it has been pointed out that the Australian Government and the several State Governments provide a wide range of subsidies to enterprises for various purposes. Where these subsidies take the form of direct payments, they are required to be brought to account as assessable income; where they come in an indirect way, for example, through reductions in the prices of inputs, they would automatically be reflected in income levels. There is nothing contrary to equity or good sense in this. Whatever their form, the subsidies result in an enhancement of the financial position of the enterprises which benefit by them and it is proper that they pay more tax accordingly. It would certainly be anomalous if subsidies like a pay-roll tax rebate were exempt from tax while the additional income generated through other kinds of subsidies continued to be subject to tax in the ordinary way. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It has also been pointed out that the rebates of pay-roll tax allowed under the old export incentive scheme were included in assessable income up to the dme the pay-roll tax was transferred to the States and that the grants based on notional pay-roll tax which have replaced the rebates are similarly treated. There would be some inconsistency if the Australian Government taxed rebates given under its own jurisdiction but exempted those given under State jurisdiction. </para>
          <para>Finally, I mention that State schemes of pay-roll tax rebates have the effect of encouraging a dispersed approach to decentralisation. The policy of the Australian Government, on the other hand, is one of promoting the accelerated growth of selected centres. </para>

              <para>and (2) Unlike the Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party&#39;s organisation is financed entirely from the contributions of its members. Consequently the various Branches of the Australian Labor Party are unable to pay their officers and staff the excessive salaries which the Liberal Party pays its officers, both those of its Secretariat and those seconded to its Parliamentary Leader&#39;s Offices by its Secretariat. It is my view that the salaries newly determined for the Officers of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party are overdue and appropriate. </para>

            <para>There remains a pressing need to consider what might be done to promote sound and effective industrial relations policies in Australia in the longer term and to ensure that the machinery and the procedures for implementing policies are the best that can be devised. However, an inquiry to investigate and report on means of achieving these longer-term objectives cannot be undertaken until there is a greater degree of stability in the current state of industrial relations. This will not be achieved until legislation to remendy existing deficiencies in the Conciliation and Arbtration Act is passed by both Houses of this Parliament. Accordingly, it is in the hands of the right honourable gentleman and his party to determine when the inquiry will proceed. If they really wish to see improvement in industrial relations in Australia they should assist in the passing of legislation which will ensure that there is a basis for stable industrial relations in this country. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the right honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Upon taking office in 1972, the Labor Government undertook a comprehensive review of the then War Service Homes Scheme and made several major changes which were incorporated in the Defence Service Homes Act 1973. Among other things, the changes included an extension of the eligibility provisions to include a person who has served on continuous full-time service as a member of the Defence Force, not being service that ended before 7 December 1972 and, during that service, has, whether before or after that date, completed three years&#39; effective fulltime service as such a member. This extension which was foreshadowed in the Prime Minister&#39;s election policy speech, was brought about because of the Government&#39;s decision to abolish conscription into the armed forces and to fulfil its stated aim of introducing conditions of service that will attract and retain regular service personnel in peacetime. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the course of the review, the question of extending the Defence Service Homes Scheme to members of the Citizen Military Force and the Women&#39;s Forces, who served in Australia during the 1939-4S War, was considered, but it was decided that, for the time being at least, there would be no change in the eligibility conditions relating to service in these Forces in the 1 939-45 War. </para>
          <para>The matter is, of course, being kept in mind for consideration along with other possible future changes in the Defence Service Homes Act, but as it involves a question of future Government policy I cannot give any indication whether the Act will be amended to cover service within Australia during the 1939-45 War. </para>

              <para>Suggestions about a United Nations University were first put forward by the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, in 1969. In 1972 the 27th General Assembly authorised the establishment of an International University which would consist of a Headquarters and Coordinating Centre together with a decentralised system of associated and affiliated universities throughout the world. In 1 973 an offer of a financial contribution of US$ 1 00m from Japan gave impetus to the project, and in November of that year a General Assembly resolution adopted a charter for the University and approved that its headquarters be located in Tokyo. Unlike the traditional concept of a post-secondary or graduate institution providing training of an educational and professional nature towards the granting of degrees to persons of a certain age group, the United Nations University is visualised as an inter-connected world-wide system of academic institutions devoted to advanced research and training, through an interdisciplinary approach, on problems of human survival, development and welfare. The official languages of the University are to be the official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian. </para>

              <para>The Australian Government supported the United Nations General Assembly Resolution which adopted a charter for the University and located the headquarters of the University in Tokyo. The University Council, in its first Session, has given preliminary consideration to the University&#39;s priorities and has made an appeal for funds. The Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, is following the Council&#39;s deliberations with sympathetic interest, but the question of financial support has been deferred until the University&#39;s objectives and organisational structure have been defined in more detail. </para>

            <para>- I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>I am flattered that the right honourable member would expect a decision as to ratification of ILO Convention No. 139- Occuptional Cancer, 1974 to be imminent within a matter of weeks after its adoption by the 59th Session of the International Labour Conference on 24 June 1974. As yet copies of the authentic text of the Convention have not been received by my Department. As soon as copies are available they will be forwarded for advice regarding current law and practice and expert views regarding ratification to the appropriate federal and state authorities, the subject matter of the Convention being applicable in both areas of jurisdiction. It is therefore too early to indicate when a decision can be made regarding ratification. I can advise, however, that the Australian Government delegates to the Conference voted in favour of adoption of both the Convention and its accompanying Recommendation. </para>
            <para>Briefly, the Convention commits ratifying states, in consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers concerned to determine periodically which carcinogenic substances and agents should be prohibited or controlled; to replace them where possible by non-carcinogenic or less harmful substances and agents; to reduce both the number of workers exposed to carcinogenic substances and agents and the degree of such exposure to the minimum compatible with safety; to prescribe protective measures; to provide workers with all the available information on the dangers involved and on the measures to be taken; to monitor exposed workers&#39; health during the period of employment and thereafter; and to give effect to these provision by laws or other methods. </para>
            <para>I welcome the right honourable member&#39;s question which indicates some awareness of the significance of the work of the ILO. For its pan, the Government attaches considerable importance to the ratification of ILO Conventions and since taking office has taken positive action to improve the poor record which Australia previously had in this respect. No doubt the right honourable member will be aware that 7 ILO </para>
            <para>Conventions have been ratified in the past 2 1 months including 3 Conventions dealing with basic human rights. Moreover, Australia was the first country to ratify Convention No. 137- Dock Work, 1973; the ratification took place on 25 June 1974, exactly 12 months after the Convention was adopted. Australia has now. ratified a total of 40 ILO Conventions and continuing action will be taken further to improve our ratification record. </para>

            <para>I sought information on the matter from the Queensland State Minister for Lands and Forestry, the Honourable W. A. R. Rae, M.L.A. He has advised me that it is not possible to provide precise figures without a great deal of research in the field to establish the original limits of the rain forest and the purpose of any clearing that has been conducted. On the basis that the Cardwell Shire in which Tully is located is the area to which the honourable member refers the Queensland Minister has had his officers make the best estimates they can. These are as follows: </para>

              <para>Yes. </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Prior to its expiration on 30 June 1973, the States Grants (Mental Health Institutions) Act 1964-1970 provided Australian Government assistance on a $1 for $2 basis towards the capital costs of State mental health institutions. The present Government&#39;s concern for the provision of residential facilities for the mentally ill and intellectually handicapped is reflected in the more flexible and more generous levels of assistance available under its Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program and its Community Health Program. </para>
          <para>The Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program is based on the Mental Health and Related Services Assistance Act 1973. It provides for 100 per cent Australian Government funding of community based mental health, alcoholism and drug dependency projects in 1973-74 and 1974-75, and allocates $7.5m for that purpose in each of those two years. </para>
          <para>After 1974-75, the Community Mental Health Program will be encompassed by the more broadly based Community Health Program. The latter Program provided $10m on a 100 per cent Australian Government funding basis in 1973-74. Australian Government funding of capital costs under the Community Health Program in 1974-75 and 1 975-76 will be on a 75 per cent basis. </para>
          <para>Both Programs enable Australian Government financial assistance to be provided for the capital costs of community (rather than institutionally) oriented residential facilities for the mentally ill and intellectually handicapped, and for alcoholics and drug dependent persons. Indeed, substantial Australian Government capital assistance was provided under those Programs in 1 973-74, for such facilities. </para>
          <para>Twenty-seven projects including or involving the provision of land or buildings for hostel accommodation for mentally ill or intellectually handicapped persons were approved for Australian Government funding. These projects attracted a total allocation of over $3.7m. An additional $154,000 was allocated to another nine projects involving the furnishing and equipping of existing premises for use as hostels for the mentally til and intellectually handicapped. </para>
          <para>Over $lm was allocated to another eleven projects that included the provision of hostel accommodation for alcoholics or drug dependent persons. </para>
          <para>With regard to the Victorian situation, it is relevant that, because of the Australian Government&#39;s desire to have the States&#39; co-operation in these Programs, projects are not generally funded unless they are sponsored by the State authorities. The Victorian proposals originally submitted for 1973-74 contained only one project involving residential accommodation. </para>
          <para>As announced in my press statement of 9 May 1974, $964,000 of the original 1973-74 allocation of $2m to Victoria under the Community Mental Program was not utilised by that State and was re-allocated to other States. Shortly after that statement, the Victorian Minister of Health requested Australian Government funds for the purchase of two properties- one at Balwyn and the other at Middle Park- for use as mental health hostels. On 1 1 June 1974, 1 approved the allocation of $1,270,000 for that purpose, under the Community Health Program. </para>
          <para>The question of future support for residential accommodation of the mentally ill and intellectually handicapped has been considered by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and is dealt with in its &#39;Report on Hospitals in Australia&#39;, which was tabled in Parliament on 10 April 1974. </para>
          <para>It is a matter of some interest that Victoria refused to participate in the hospital statistical study carried out throughout Australia as background to that Report. </para>
          <para>The Government is giving detailed consideration to the recommendations in that Report. </para>

            <para>The Australian Government together with the Queensland Government established a Burdekin Project Committee in September 1973 to set in train and supervise a comprehensive program of investigations into the potential for development of the resources of the basin on the Burdekin River and its tributaries for industrial, mining, urban and agricultural uses, hydro-electricity generation and for flood mitigation. </para>
            <para>The investigations cover all feasible storage sites and water uses and, accordingly, should be distinguished from a feasibility study of the Burdekin Dam Project alone. </para>
            <para>As information becomes available the Committee will examine potential development options for various needs. </para>
            <para>During 1973-74, the Burdekin Project Committee initiated engineering studies at varying levels of detail on potential storage sites on the Burdekin River. Preliminary investigations were carried out on suitable storage sites on the Belyando, Suttor, Cape and Campaspe rivers, tributaries of the Burdekin River. </para>
            <para>Groundwater investigations in the basin during 1973-74 included test bore drilling and geological mapping. </para>
            <para>Commercial irrigation trials were carried out at Millaroo Research Station on a range of potential production possibilities. A new field research station was established on the right bank of the Lower Burdekin River to test the potential, under simulated commercial conditions, of soil groupings not present at the Millaroo Research Station. Soil surveys on the right bank of the Lower Burdekin River have been commenced as well as an assessment of the salinity and fertility status of these soils. </para>
            <para>Catchment erosion and land capability studies were also commenced and appropriate mapping studies are in progress. Representative erosion measurement stations have been installed. A start has also been made on possible environmental consequences of various development options and on the potential for industrial development in the Burdekin Basin. </para>
            <para>The 1974-75 program of investigations will entail a continuation of the broad spectrum of investigations commenced in 1973-74, with relatively more emphasis on investigations into the potential for industrial development in the basin and neighbouring areas of economic influence. It is also planned to commence investigations during the coming financial year into the potential for hydro and thermal power generation in the Burdekin Basin. </para>
            <para>The scope of the 1 974-75 program of investigations will depend on the extent of financial allocations by the Australian and State Governments. </para>

            <para>Yes. The Government&#39;s recognition of the urgent need to provide financial assistance for the treatment of alcoholics, as well as persons suffering from mental illness and drug abuse, is reflected in the provisions of the Mental Health and Related Services Assistance Act 1973. That Act authorises Federal grants of up to $7.5m each year in 1973-74 and 1 974-75 for approved projects under the Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program. </para>
            <para>After June 1975, such assistance will continue to be provided, but under the more broadly based Community Health Program. </para>
            <para>Not only intake and assessment centres, but also community oriented facilities and services for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics have been funded under the Community Mental Health, Alcoholism and Drug Dependency Program. In 1973-74, allocations were made for the following projects dealing wholly or partly with alcoholism: </para>

          <para class="block">In regard to trapping, WHO advocates this method of control for rodents taken aboard modern rat-proof ships with cargo. It is only successful in very limited infestations and if it is applied very soon after the infestation occurs. Massive infestations are best handled by sanitary measures and a program of poisoning using anticoagulants or acute poisons as dictated by conditions. On some occasions fumigation with toxic gases (hydrocyanic acid gas, for example) may be used but this is a dangerous and inconvenient technique that is best reserved for use when the whole ship can be subjected to fumigation. </para>

              <para>1 ) The two major vegetable oils used in the manufacture of poly-unsaturated margarine are understood to be safflower and sunflower. The Australian production of safflower, because of agronomic problems, has progressively declined over recent years from 3,241 tonnes of oil in 1968-69 to an estimated 1,767 tonnes in 1973-74. Imports of safflower oil in the same period have decreased from 1,957 tonnes to 1,119 tonnes (II months only). Conversely, the production of sunflower oil has increased greatly from 2,370 tonnes in 1968-69 to an estimated 27,520 tonnes in 1973-74 while imports over this period have been negligible. However, details of each margarine manufacturer&#39;s formulations and the specific end uses of poly-unsaturated oils are not available. </para>

            <para>If the formulation of the new poly-unsaturated margarine &#39; Becel &#39; is based predominantly on the use of safflower oil it is likely that a variable proportion of the total requirements would need to be imported; alternatively it may be technically possible to substitute locally produced sunflower oil for safflower oil. But as noted above, information as to the ingredients of particular margarine packs is not available. </para>

              <para>1 ) There are over 1 80 known different in vitro radioisotope diagnostic kits for the assay of 39 different biologicals which could be purchased from overseas sources of supply by medical laboratories in Australia which hold licences from State Authorities to use radioisotopes. Of these, the following kits were being provided in July 1 974 at no charge by the Australian Radiation Laboratory to approved medical users for routine diagnostic tests on patients: </para>

          <item label="(2)">
            <para>The accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of in vitro diagnostic tests are investigaged by manufacturers during the development and production of kits. For the user of kits, the important thing is that the clinical accuracy and reproducibility of a particular test, both short term and long term, should be satisfactory. Before a radioisotope kit is made available at no charge by the Australian Radiation Laboratory for routine clinical purposes, it must be considered satisfactory for the intended diagnostic test by a number of competent medical laboratories in Australia to which the kits have been submitted for assessment. All of the diagnostic kits listed above have been checked for clinical accuracy and reproducibility through this procedure. By limiting the number of different types of kit made available for each particular diagnostic test, inter-laboratory comparison of results is simplified. The Australian Radiation Laboratory has recently commenced a Quality Assurance Program for in vitro thyroid tests in which samples of the same serum are submitted to participating laboratories for assay. Results are then tabulated and circulated so that the participating medical laboratories are able to compare results. It is proposed to extend the Quality Assurance Program to other in vitro diagnostic tests. </para>

            <para>A meeting of the Working Group of the InterDepartmental Committee, referred to in that reply, was held late last year. It was agreed at that meeting that Departments should give detailed consideration to the conceptual framework for social indicator development, focussing on areas of particular concern to them. This process is now nearing completion and it is intended that the Working Group should meet again shortly. </para>
            <para>As the right honourable member is no doubt aware, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been taking an active interest in this area, and a meeting of the OECD Working Party on Social Indicators is to be held in Paris on 8-1 1 November. We shall wish to take into account discussions at that meeting in the further developments of the Australian social indicators programme. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  ( 1 ), (2) and (3) The Textiles Authority&#39;s report of 5 July 1 974 on certain items of apparel (Industries Assistance Commission Report No. 20) recommended that the Australian Government take action to restrain the level of certain knitted and woven apparel items entering the Australian market from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, India and China. In accepting and acting upon the Textiles Authority&#39;s findings and recommendations, the Australian Government has had regard to its rights and obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles (The Textiles Arrangement) and the Australia-China Trade Agreement. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Taiwan is not a party to the GATT or to the Textiles Arrangement and the Australian Government has no bilateral trade commitments to Taiwan. The Government decided, therefore, to give effect to the Textiles Authority&#39;s findings and recommendations concerning Taiwan by means of import licensing controls. </para>
          <para>India, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong, like Australia, are signatories to the Textiles Arrangement. The Arrangement provides for the application of restraints on trade in textiles products subject to certain provisions, including the need to consult with signatory member countries whose exports would be affected by proposed restraint action. </para>
          <para>In the case of China, the Textiles Authority recommended that restraint action be taken only in respect of imports into Australia of certain knitted products. Having regard, inter alia, to the reciprocal most-favoured-nation provisions of the Australia-China Trade Agreement, the Australian Government considered that the only responsible course of action was to consult with the Chinese authorities to seek to reach a mutually acceptable level of restraint on trade in the products concerned. </para>
