            <para>-  I thank the honourable member for that question because it affords me the opportunity of shedding a bit of light on both sides of this Parliament.. I commend to the attention of everybody a document that was published yesterday. It is called: &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure, March 1974&#39;. It is a digest of expenditure at all public levels in Australia, including State government, local government, semi-governmental and so on. It discloses that in 1973-74 the projected outlays by all levels of government are estimated to total $15.7 billion. Out of that sum the State governments and their local and semigovernmental authorities will be responsible for about $7.9 billion, or slightly more than half. These figures relate to total outlays including direct expenditure on both goods and services and transfers - items like social service payments, payments in cash and kind and so on. The expenditure on what is described as &#39;goods and services&#39; is tabulated. They are the payments excluding transfers. The States are responsible for an even larger proportion. It is estimated that total public expenditure on goods and services in 1973-74 will be about $10.6 billion, of which the States and their authorities will be responsible for about $6.8 billion, or two-thirds. In respect of governmental capital expenditure in Australia, which aggregates more than $4 billion, the Commonwealth is responsible for only $l,100m. In other words near enough to three-quarters of capital expenditure in Australia is not conducted directly at the federal level at all. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One finds a similar picture in what is called public employment. At August 1973 there were 1,160,000 civilian government employees in Australia of whom 790,000, or more than two-thirds - 70 per cent - were employed by the State governments or their authorities. The honourable member asked what were the implications of these facts in relation to the public expenditure cuts prepared by the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think that they have been prepared; I think they have been only proposed. The implication is that unless absolutely draconian cuts were to be made at the Australian Government level, expenditure reductions to be effective would need to extend to the State local government sectors, which sectors are of course responsible for a wide variety of essential public services and facilities, ranging from education to sewerage. </para>

              <para>-  I may say that this is the first question I have been asked in this House in 3 weeks, with the exception of one asked from my side of the House in respect of the gold mining industry. I am taking the best of my limited opportunities. I might add that I am on the last 30 seconds of the answer. Over 50 per cent of the outlays of the States and their authorities are financed from Australian Government grants or from loan moneys. Such payments represent about one-third of the Australian Government&#39;s Budget. It would be a matter for the members of the Opposition to say what their intentions would be in respect of Australian Government assistance to the States. Suffice to say that it is just another aspect of their proposals which has not been made clear. For this Government&#39;s part, we make no apology for the fact that payments to the States are growing rapidly and that it is through such payments teat a large part of our social program is being achieved. </para>

            <para>- I find the honourable gentleman&#39;s question to have little to do with the answer that I just gave but that no doubt is understandable. All that I did give was a factual analysis of the situation at all levels of government in Australia. When those who say that if there is a change of government they will, as a consequence, both reduce taxation and presumably cut down on what they call vast public expenditure, I think there is an obligation upon them to indicate specifics about the two. What particular taxes would be cut and for whom, and where would the vast cuts in public expenditure take place, particularly when they seem to be committed to increasing one level of Government expenditure, that is, the defence vote? It seems to me that this is highly inconsistent and I believe that those are the sorts of questions that the honourable gentleman should be answering in public. </para>

In view of the fact that the Senate will undoubtedly render unrecognisable the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill which was passed last year by this House, and in view of the Minister&#39;s desire to establish rural co-operative processing factories in Australia, can the Minister overcome the limitation in the existing Australian Industry Development Corporation legislation to enable the present AIDC to assist financially the setting up of such rural cooperatives? </para>

            <para>-  It is true that there is a very strong desire now shown in applications to the Australian Industry Development Corporation for assistance to help set up factories to process primary products in country areas. One example is vegetables in the north of Tasmania and another is broiler chickens in southern Victoria, both of which industries are in difficulties. Rural communities are frequently at the mercy of large scale city corporations, many of them foreign owned, which, by their control of the bottleneck situation that exists between the producer and the consumer, both exploit the producer by giving him a lower price and the consumer by charging a higher one. I want to change that. I want the AIDC to be used to assist producer co-operatives. This can be one of the most important future roles that the AIDC can have in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We want to protect both the fanner and the housewife - the consumer - against the form of exploitation that goes on, which occurs when competition is eliminated by monopoly practices, and very often these are engaged in by multi-national corporations which are overseas owned. The honourable member asked whether the AIDC is limited in its powers at the present time to act in this area. The truth is that it is so limited. The AIDC is expected to operate on sound commercial principles. Quite a number of these cooperatives are not designed to operate on a profit making basis. They are sound, but they are not normally commercial. The AIDC is limited by the whole orientation of the previous Act under which it is established towards normal commercial practices and to paying its way. It is very often necessary to begin the assistance to co-operatives of this kind which do not pass the normal test of sound commercial operation. Also, the AIDC is limited by the funds which are available to it both here and overseas. These are limitations that we sought to remove by the 2 Bills that were passed by this House but which the Senate has failed to pass. I would expect the Australian people to be very interested in the outcome of this matter: It will be a significant matter in the forthcoming election. </para>

            <para>-  I would never say anything so macabre about the shadow Treasurer. I will consider what submissions I will make to the Governor-General about dissolving both Houses when the Senate has decided its attitude about the 3 Appropriation Bills. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1973-74 has been before the Senate for some weeks. The Senate has not chosen to express a view upon it. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1973-74 and Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1973-74 I expect will go from this House to the Senate this afternoon. It is true that the Senate, by again rejecting the 2 health insurance Bills, has fortified the case for a double dissolution. I expect - I hope - that the Senate will additionally fortify a submission for a dissolution of both Houses by again rejecting the following Bills which are prominently on its notice paper: The Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill, the National Investment Fund Bill and the Trade Practices </para>

            <para>- The employment figures as at March 1974 reveal that the number of vacant jobs now exceeds the number of people who are registered as unemployed by 5,000. For the same period - March 1972  -  the number of unemployed people exceeded the number of vacant jobs by more than 68,000. But, as the honourable gentleman points out, this is not the only measure of the country&#39;s extraordinary degree of prosperity. For the year ended December 1973 there was an enormous growth rate in the total work force, so much so that there was an increase of 215,700 jobs over the number for the previous 12 months. For 1972 - the last year for which the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer - the increase in the number of jobs was only 87,400. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I am obliged to the honourable gentleman for that. For the year ended December 1971 the increase in the number of jobs - that is, the number of people in the work force - was only 42,500. So we can see that over a period from 1971 to 1973 the number of additional people employed increased from the -rate of 42,000 a year to 215,000 a year. The more pleasing feature of these figures is that which reveals the extent of the participation of married women in the work force. </para>

              <para>- Well, it is regrettable that the honourable member made some allegations. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads is probably the most independent of all statutory authorities under Commonwealth administration. It has done a very fine job for the Australian people as a whole. It is very widely respected within the States. An independent authority is already looking at the aspects of inner city, mid city and outer city freeways. That authority has drawn on the experience of advisers from overseas and it has been found that whenever freeways have been used in inner city areas, they have solved the problems only on a temporary basis and that in the long term they have aggravated the traffic problem. Therefore, I believe that the assessment made by the Bureau of Roads is actually in line with the assessment of the Victorian Hamer Government. It is unfortunate that the conservative elements in New South Wales still want to stand by outmoded dogma set down some 30 years ago. I ask all honourable members to study in some detail the report of the Bureau of Roads because it is important that money allocated to freeways does not distort the overall provision of resources to urban development. If we misspend a great deal of money on inner city freeways, that will be money we cannot spend on other aspects of urban affairs. It is the policy of this Government to stop the over-centralisation of central business districts which occurred during the 23 years of the previous Government&#39;s administration. What we are trying to do is to bring about a rational growth of the major cities of Australia and to oppose the inner city freeways as an intelligent approach in an effort not to over-centralise but to rationalise the development of our major cities. </para>

            <para>-  No. This would be the very worst way to counter inflation. I notice it is the method which commends itself to the Leader of the Opposition. I noticed today that his program, as has been reported, is: &#39;Snedden will cut welfare, schools&#39;. Another report states that a Liberal Government would consider cutting expenditure in all fields, including education, health and transport. I was astonished, reading this morning&#39;s newspapers, to see what confusion the Opposition parties have fallen into. The shadow Treasurer, for instance, is now disowning a proposal that the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party had made to cut taxation by $600m and he asks that he be regarded as non-committal on that proposal. At any rate, we now have from the Leader of the Opposition - the Leader of the Liberal Party - an answer to a question relating to what public spending the Liberal Party would cut if the Australian people were foolish enough to return it to the government of this country. It would dismantle-- </para>

              <para>- As I was saying, in the same breath as the present Leader of the Liberal Party says he wants to reduce Government spending, he says he wants to spend more money on defence. He even wants to send soldiers back to Singapore. What sort of crazy logic is this? He wants to cut Government spending yet at the same time restore a superphosphate bounty which costs taxpayers $65m a year. Yet when the Leader of the Country Party, the shadow Treasurer, was asked whether he would restore rural subsidies he said: &#39;I do not think I can make a commitment there. The financial circumstances have changed very much since we were in office. I am not one who supports subsidies for farmers unless there is real justification for them&#39;. That is what the shadow Treasurer, the Leader of the Country Party, said the day before yesterday. The Opposition&#39;s so-called policies are the greatest mishmash of halfbaked, ill-considered and contradictory proposals ever served up to the Australian people and will undoubtedly be wholeheartedly rejected by them. </para>

            <para>-  My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will remember with pleasure, I think, that on a David Frost show last year he said that the greatest disaster involving the Labor Government up to that time was the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation raids under the gallant leadership of the AttorneyGeneral. Will the Prime Minister, as a matter of fact, let the House know whether the Gair episode in which both the Prime Minister and the accident prone Attorney-General have been directly involved is the most contemptible exhibition of incompetent administration and thinking in the history of the Labor Government? If it is not, will he please let the House know what were the other incidents? </para>

            <para>-  I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question concerning defence factories. There can be no doubt that problems do exist with them in the sense that at a time of peace, a time of general relaxation in international tension as far as Australia is concerned, they pose a difficulty in relation to the obtaining of nondefence work. There can be no doubt also that if the Labor Government were not in power - if the Liberal and Country parties were in power - those government factories would be facing considerable retrenchments. There can be little doubt about that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Some time ago I began a course of action designed to encourage the acquisition of commercial work, non-defence work. I began making statements on the need for it and on the fact that there was unused excess capacity in the factories. We began to place advertisements in the Press seeking the co-operation of private enterprise industry in the solving of this problem. I am happy to say that the result of those efforts has been one of considerable success. There has been a considerable expression of interest. In fact we have an officer out full time obtaining work. We set up a committee to obtain work. In the case of some of the factories there has been a very considerable percentage increase in the nondefence work that the factories have been able to obtain. </para>
          <para>Recently, because of the emphasis that has been given in the community to the energy crisis and to the premium on the traditional sources of fuel, we have had an inquiry into the possibility of the factories - particularly the factory in the honourable member&#39;s electorate - making perhaps solar energy units that might be incorporated in government houses in, say, the Northern Territory or even the Australian Capital Territory. That committee has taken some steps towards a consideration of its proposals. That is something which is still under consideration. We also have in mind some schemes which we hope will produce a continuation of the success we have already had. For example, it is believed that the factories could make distress signalling devices for shipping and also an improved sheep shearing cutter. That is something which is particularly adapted to the skills, techniques and equipment that exist in the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. </para>

              <para>-  That factory has made them previously and made them very well. So, in general terms, the action that the Government has taken has been very successful. In fact, one can measure that success in this way: It may interest honourable members to know that in recent times, since action was taken firm commercial orders received by the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow in 1974 exceed those obtained in the past 3 years. The general saving to the defence forces excess capacity vote is very considerable. There are different ways of measuring that saving, but, according to one measure, the saving could be as high as $4m. </para>

            <para>-  I notice that there was some question as to the correct pronunciation of the name of the honourable member&#39;s electorate. I myself am a bit confused as 1 noticed an advertisement by the Australian National Party or National Alliance or Australian Country Party, in which a photograph of the honourable gentleman appears above the name &#39;Peter Nixon&#39;. A photograph of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> appears above the name &#39;Max Holton&#39; spelled H.O.L.T.O.N. We will have a pretty bright campaign if members of the Country Party are confused even about their names and their portraits. The honourable gentleman quoted in part the policy of the Australian Labor Party. But perhaps I could reassure him by quoting another more recent elaboration of the Party&#39;s policy on one of the aspects with which he is concerned. It reads: </para>

            <para>-  This subject has been of concern to this House for some considerable time. When I was the shadow Minister for Transport I said on numerous occasions that we would do something about this problem. Since I have been Minister for Transport I have had a number of informal discussions with the airlines and I have asked them to do something about their schedules. I have had meetings with them as recently as two and a half to three weeks ago. Since then I have issued a specific instruction to my Department that it is to confer with the air lines and that it is to get rid of parallel scheduling as quickly as possible. After 4 meetings between my Department and the airlines we are getting nowhere. We face complete frustration. If the airline companies continue along these lines the Government will take some very positive action against them to force them to abandon the idea of parallel scheduling. It is absolutely ridiculous. Even on the Sydney to Melbourne run, which has approximately 28 nights a day the flights of both airline companies leave on the hour, with other services in between. At present nights to Tasmania, Alice Springs, Coolangatta and even to the Australian Capital Territory are scheduled by both companies at 7.10 a.m., 8.20 a.m. and at regular intervals throughout the day. Unless the companies do something about this situation immediately the Government will have to examine ways and means of overcoming the problem; for example, by not allowing the companies to use Commonwealth airports for a start </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Treasurer. It arises from recent pledges by the Leader of the Opposition to implement a 3- month price freeze if the Opposition were returned to office. Is it a fact that due to the defeat of the prices referendum last year the constitutional power presently available to the Australian Government would not enable the effective enforcement of a price freeze? Is it also a fact any reference of price control powers to the Australian Government by the States for a limited period only, as called for by the Opposition last year, would be a cumbersome procedure giving price fixers ample time to raise prices before the freeze could be imposed? Will the Treasurer inform the House whether the Government has given any consideration to a short term voluntary price freeze and if so, whether it regards such a proposition as being at all feasible or in any way worthwhile as an anti-inflationary device? </para>

              <para>-  That remains to be seen. The honourable member for Gellibrand asked me a question about voluntary price and wage freezes or price and wage freezes generally. As is known, the Government sought to get control over prices and incomes at recent referendums because we believe that this sort of problem is best tackled nationally. The problem embraces the whole of Australia and is not confined to particular States. Those powers were refused because the Opposition did not want the Government to be given the powers. As to being able to do it voluntarily, the honourable gentleman knows he cannot do it voluntarily. Where I can I have suggested that the price makers ought to exercise a little more voluntary restraint on prices than they do. I say here unequivocally that if it were not for the Prices Justification Tribunal a lot of prices that have not risen would have risen. On the other hand, to call for a prices and wages freeze at the time when a case is before the Arbitration Commission in respect of wages indicates to me the class nature of the Opposition parties opposite. </para>

          <para>-  I have to inform the House that I have received advice from the general secretary of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Union that at a meeting of the refreshment rooms staff held this morning it was resolved that all staff would return to duty at the normal hour tomorrow morning. I have noticed that the break in services has interfered with the diets of many members of this Parliament. I can see that for myself. The return to work is conditional upon the payment of wage increases already approved for sessional staff being made forthwith. Discussions will take place with the Public Service Arbitrator in relation to the permanent staff as soon as arranged. Both .these requirements are acceptable to the  President  of the Senate and myself. Arrangements to give effect to them have been put in hand. </para>

          <para>- Yes. My statement last night was correct. I have the documents here. They are photocopies on rather slippery paper and not originals. The original documents are identifiable; If the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> did not read them, someone else at least either read them or, at the very least, went to the trouble of retaining the originals and providing photocopies. I am not terribly impressed by this sort of procedure. The honourable member is trying to make some running about rough tactics. First of all, a document marked highly confidential&#39; by the Liberal Party when it gets into my hands ceases to be even slightly confidential. I want to make this point- </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in answer to a question today, when he was commenting on a wide range of matters relating to the forthcoming election, referred to a report in the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; this morning about my attitude to the need to arrest the rate of growth of public spending.

        <para class="block">Press, out of which came very many reports, one of which was the one from the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39;. The clearest way to make it absolutely certain what I said, is to ask for leave to include in Hansard a transcript of what I said. That transcript was not taken by me; it was taken by one of the senior journalists in the Parliamentary Press Gallery. I would ask leave to table, and preferably to have incorporated in Hansard, that transcript. Then the misrepresentation will be abundantly clear. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the transcript. </para>

            <para>- I will in a couple of words, if the Country Party will give me time. It was to the advantage of Brutus and Cassius to avoid a decisive battle with the forces of Antony and Octavius which were much larger than theirs. Antony did what he could to provoke a battle and finally they went to battle. This is surely the situation as it is today: We have the numbers, you on the other side have the supply. We want battle, to meet you at the polls, but your forces are doing everything in their power in another place to avoid going to battle. I say to the honourable member for Moreton: Aye, we will meet in Philippi, where your hour will be come. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">In moving this motion I would like to give some indication of the reason for taking this course. It is a matter of paramount importance that work begin as soon as possible on the new international terminal for many reasons. The Government does not lightly by-pass the Public Works Committee but recent events in Parliament, such as the intention by the Opposition to refuse supply and force the Government to hold a general election, has put the Government in a difficult position if it is to face the need for a new terminal in a responsible way. Even before the question of a double dissolution of Parliament was raised, a Public Works Committee review of the project would have delayed completion by several months. </para>
          <para class="block">With the greatly increased complexities raised by the intrusion of an election campaign and a general election for both Houses of Parliament, then the delay could well extend to almost a year, given the return of this Government. In the unlikely event of a change of government, the delay could be much greater even if a new government proceeded with this important project, and that would be doubtful. Ideally, in the ordinary course of events, a Public Works Committee report could have been presented to the Parliament for adoption by mid-June prior to the winter recess. Design and contract documentation would have proceeded so as to allow the initial construction phase to be committed early July, thus enabling the weather critical activities to be undertaken before the onset of the wet season. Obviously this timetabling would not be possible with the impending dissolution of the 28th Parliament. Taken in conjunction with these complications, there are many overwhelming reasons why construction of a new international terminal at Brisbane Airport is a matter of the utmost urgency. </para>

              <para>-  The honourable member says &#39;hooey&#39;. Let me hear how many of the following points he is likely to contradict. The present terminal is totally inadequate for these reasons: First, it is too small and cannot be extended because of the adjacent existing domestic terminals which are also too small and urgently require expansion. Secondly, the present terminal is a World War II vintage timber and galvanised iron igloo which is only half the required size. It is poorly designed to confer adequate protection against drug smuggling and illegal entry. In a time of world outcry for top level protection against hijacking and threats to personal security of airline passengers and crew, a building such as the present terminal is impossible to secure satisfactorily. Thirdly, industrial complaints are centred upon the extremely uncomfortable conditions and even physical distress suffered by staff and passengers in a Brisbane tropical summer. The terminal cannot be modified to overcome this major deficiency. It is intolerable that one of Australia&#39;s major cities has an international air terminal which would do justice to a banana republic. Fourthly, the question of tourism also arises. Brisbane is a major point of entry for tourists, especially those who wish to visit the Great Barrier Reef or the Gold Coast. It is a disgrace to a country now trying to increase its tourism earnings to ask overseas visitors to begin their holiday at such a dilapidated terminal. How many millions do we lose annually because of archaic terminal facilities? I understand the commercial interests , of Brisbane have made strong complaints about the adverse economic effect of this antiquated terminal upon the economic well-being of Australia&#39;s third largest city. It is easy to see the justice of their representations. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another powerful reason for an early start upon the new terminal is that the present building is a structural hazard in high wind conditions. Incredibly, given the fact that Brisbane is in the cyclone belt, the present terminal is so unsafe that it is evacuated whenever the Bureau of Meteorology predicts winds above 60 miles per hour from the critical direction. For how long can we tolerate a public building which is so old and structurally hazardous that it has to be abandoned by its occupants when the wind even hints at the possibility of high velocity? This building clearly should not be in use for a moment longer than is absolutely necessary. That is why we cannot afford the time consuming process of a Public Works Committee review. A delay now could mean that this unsafe, hothouse igloo could still be in use 2 tropical summers and several cyclones from this date. It is clearly of great importance to scrap this relic of the past, which the previous Government did nothing about for 23 years, as soon as physically possible and to replace it with a building suitable for the 1970s and the 1980s. Our country cannot afford to tolerate such buildings for a moment longer than is absolutely necessary. As well this building is a fire hazard. We cannot run the risk of allowing a cyclone or fire to demolish this building, possibly with the loss of life. </para>
          <para>I have quickly, cryptically and cursorily run through some of the reasons which caused the Government to believe that in the face of the present situation - the prospects of a double dissolution - it would be irresponsible to take a course of action which would delay progress in the construction of this building. Those honourable members who sit opposite clearly must share the blame, if not predominantly accept the blame, for the fact that the time honoured custom of referring such projects to the processes of the Public Works Committee cannot effectively be fulfilled in the present situation while the House is facing the prospect of an election. The honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> is scratching his head. He would know, first of all, that the holding of an election could possibly take up to 18 May. After that there is the calling together of the respective parties including the Government party or parties. I hope that my Party will be re-elected to government and that we will get down to business very quickly. But even in those circumstances we would miss the summer season to which I have referred. We would not be able to cover the building. lt is likely that that would put this process into a very backward stage. I take the trouble to pay tribute to the Public Works Committee for the service it has rendered over the lifetime of the present Parliament up to this stage and respectfully put to it that extenuating circumstances have caused the Government to take the course of action which is the subject of the motion before the House. </para>

            <para>- The Government is asking us to take a very serious step today. On only one occasion since I became a member of this House in 1958 has there been a case where the Government has asked for a public work of this magnitude to be treated as urgent and not to be subjected to examination by the Public Works Committee. Recently - before the Western Australian State election - we had what I would call a very grave exposure of the way in which the Government is beginning to use the Public Works Committee. The Public Works Committee, as the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> would know as he was once a member of it, has always prided itself on being above the baser levels of Party politics. Until today - we had one today - there has never &#39;been a division in it along Party lines. All the traditions have been dragged in the dirt by the Government and in particular by the Minister, who should know - who does know - of the quality of work and the standards set by the Public Works Committee. In the Western Australian case we had the Government hoping to get some political advantage out of an announcement that a Post Office building would be constructed in Forrest Place, Perth. That project was brought before the Committee 10 to 12 weeks before documentation was ready. I would say that it was one of the most glaring examples of the </para>

          <para>Public Works Committee being reduced to the level of a Party political machine. </para>
          <para>The project that is the subject of this motion is sought to be carried out without reference to the Public Works Committee for examination as it is regarded as urgent. No one denies that it is urgent. But what is wrong with the footwork so that the Government could not get it to the Committee earlier? The Committee always has a great interest in the timetable of projects. Knowing the nature of the projects that normally come to it for examination the Committee usually goes down to the end of the pipeline and listens for the things that are supposed to gush out. One of the things that was going to gush out some months ago was the Brisbane Airport proposal. What happened? Obviously the Government, for one reason or another, was not able to do its homework and get it to the Committee in time for examination. </para>
          <para>The Minister, who should know the kind of obligations that he has to the Committee, did not tell us why it was that this delay took place. There may have been reasons for the delay, but there has not been one word of explanation from the Minister about it. The delay is going to mean that work of this magnitude will escape examination by the Public Works Committee. I wonder what kind of attitude the Minister would have adopted if he had been a member of the Committee and he had been treated in this way. Either the Minister does not trust the Public Works Committee or the  Chairman  of the Public Works Committee does not trust his Committee because the Committee met this morning and there was not one word of warning about this matter coming up today. If the Minister trusted the Committee, as previous Ministers did, he would surely have alerted the  Chairman  of the Committee to what was coming up. </para>

              <para>- I did not see the notice of motion. Why is it that the  Chairman  of the Committee, if he knew about it, did not mention it to his Committee this morning? The Minister served as a member of the Committee when I was its  Chairman.  I ask: If I had done that to the Minister what would have been bis reaction? What would the reaction have been if I had not taken the Committee into my confidence and said: &#39;This is the problem. Let us have a look at the timetable. Let us have a look at the position in which the Government finds itself. There was not one word of consultation with members of the Committee from this side of the House. The Committee met this morning. I will be entering into the results of that meeting later in the day. But for now I want to express my acute concern about this treatment of the Public Works Committee, which the Minister knows and the House. I think, will accept has set a standard for objectivity, honesty and an ability to work together. In this case, with an election coming up, no one consulted this side of the House. I, as  Deputy Chairman  of the Committee, did not hear a word about this matter. What kind of treatment is that? I am justified in asking whether this is just a political gimmick. It may not be. I am not saying that there is not a need in this respect, but I am saying that this is shabby treatment of a Committee which in the past has set a standard in the operation of the democratic process of which the House and the Parliament has every reason to be proud. Now it finds itself being treated like this without one word of consultation. </para>

              <para>- It might not exist, but its traditions will exist, in spite of what the Minister for Housing and Construction has done to them in his short term of office. It is of great grief to me to find that a previous member of the Committee who served it with distinction and loyalty, should now be the instrument for bringing it down to a level to which it has never descended before. I hope it will rise again in the future. </para>

As the  Chairman  of the Committee I did not bring it to the attention of the Committee because it was not my place to do so. The Committee was not asked to look at the matter. There has been a similar occurrence in this respect.. I refer to the Army accommodation project at Townsville. This project was not placed before the Public Works Committee because it is classified as urgent and as being in the best interests of the public. What was so secret about the accommodation proposed for Army personnel at Townsville? I could never work that decision out at all. The contracts for the project were let to people who employed foreigners on the construction. They could work on those buildings and go in and out of the area; yet, the members of the Public Works Committee were not allowed to inquire into the construction of this accommodation. </para>

The honourable member for Wakefield has introduced into matters affecting the Public Works Committee an aspect which has never been brought in before - that is, politics. We have tried to keep the work of the Public Works Committee above politics. We endeavoured to do that, even when we were in Opposition. The honourable member for Wakefitld is introducing politics into this Committee, more strongly than anyone else has, since I commenced serving on that Committee. </para>

          <para>I did not bring the matter of the Brisbane Airport project before the Committee today. It was not referred to the Committee. Why should I do so? The honourable member for Wakefield knew as much about the matter as I did, or he should have. All I knew was that the Government was to re-build this international terminal at the Brisbane Airport because it was needed urgently. I wholeheartedly agree that it is needed urgently. The present international terminal is a fire trap and a hazard to the people who use it. I do not believe that there is so much wrong with the suggestion made by the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> that this work is urgently required and that it is not necessary for the project to be referred to the Public Works Committee. </para>
          <para>I regard this work as urgent. I would have liked the project to be referred to the Public Works Committee. But I did not think it was my duty to raise the matter with the Committee at its meeting this morning. The matter was not referred to the Committee by the Government. Why should we argue about a project which will not even be referred to the Public Works Committee? I regret, as I said, that the project was not brought before the Committee. I think there is much to be said for this work being investigated more thoroughly than it has been. But because of the circumstances explained to me by the Minister for Housing and Construction who indicated that this work was urgent I agreed with his proposed course of action. He explained the situation to me. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> stressed the urgency for this work because of the present terrible risk to personal life. I agree with this proposal wholeheartedly. I do not think that the Government has done anything wrong at all. I regret that politics has been brought into the Public Works Committee. </para>

If a story were to read: &#39;Once upon a time a member of a newly elected government won a seat by 35 votes and then that government, at a time of desperation, took action to try to save that seat&#39; - we would have the key to the successful initiation of this Brisbane Airport project. The reasons outlined by the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> cannot be argued properly from this side of the House because I have not seen the actual report which was tabled a short while ago in this House. That report, I understand gave the problems of termites, fire hazards, rats, mice, drugs and so on as the reasons for the urgency of this matter. </para>

              <para>- He is &#39;Lilleywhite&#39; with fear, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy</inline> Speaker; and he is the honourable member for Lilley. As I was saying, this project is nothing but a matter of expediency. In more than a decade no previous government ever resorted to tactics such as these at the twelfth hour. The bell tolls at midnight for the rising of this Parliament. Yet, the Government at this time suddenly rushes in the plans for a new international terminal at Brisbane Airport. The Australian Labor Party has contracted a terminal disease of panic. I predict that the limited life span of the Brisbane international terminal will be years longer that the life span of the present Government. </para>

          <para>In a moment of utter desperation the Government has overlooked the question of the quality of life. One of the pressing requests of those 50,000 residents of Brisbane who live under the flight paths of aircraft using Brisbane Airport is that its runways be relocated. The Coombs Task Force was a committee set up by this Government which is on its way out. The report of that body on page 149 states - and I know this off by heart now - that in the year 1973-74 $lm was to be set aside for work at Brisbane Airport, in 1974-75 the sum was to be $13m, and in 1975-76 expenditure was to be $18m, and thereafter $130m. Yet the Government thinks that by spending $3. 7m it will give Brisbane a new international terminal which the Prime Minister can use on his infrequent visits to Queensland, and the people of Queensland will be bought off. The Government has stated repeatedly that it will not re-site the runways, as planned by the previous Government. In return, the Liberal </para>
          <para class="block">Party will run away with the seat of Lilley. This will help to ensure the defeat of a government which has, in 17 months, led this nation  to  the brink of disaster. </para>
          <para>Do not let my position be misunderstood. Let it not be thought that I am not happy that at last something - paltry as it is - will be done about the Brisbane Airport. But much more has to be done. I feel sorry for the honourable member for Lilley who, in the few months he has been in this chamber has made some effort in relation to this matter. He made an effort particularly after the honourable member for Petrie and I spoke so frequently about this matter. The honourable member for Lilley and other honourable members suddenly took an interest in the Brisbane Airport. The fact that the Government is prepared to spend only $3. 7m - in fact it is prepared to cut back planned expenditure in the electorate of the honourable member for Lilley - reveals the low regard in which it surely holds the honourable member. </para>
          <para>Some of the credit for the Government&#39;s decision to erect this terminal must surely be attributed to the new director of Qantas Airways Ltd, the State  President  of the Queensland Trades and Labour Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Egerton was given one of the &#39;jobs for the boys&#39;. But on joining the Qantas board, he realised, for the reasons enunciated today by the Minister for Housing and Construction, the need for a new international terminal at Brisbane. The honourable member  for  Petrie and I are lucky that our views have been reinforced by those of a man who is far above cheap, nasty politics such as we have seen in this chamber this afternoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr friend,</inline> the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> was for years the  Chairman  of the Public Works Committee. One does not often see him angry in this House, but today his voice was shaking with anger at the realisation that the Committee, of which for so many years he has been a highly respected member and past  chairman,  would be prostituted for a small political gain. This is what it is all about. I am sure the people of Brisbane will not be fooled. I have seen governments in previous years try in a desperate bid to save a seat by spending millions of dollars. The people are not easily fooled. Members opposite will meet a Waterloo in Lilley on 18 May 1974. </para>

            <para>- We have heard contributions from 2 members of the Opposition. The first was from the honourable mem ber for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> who seemed to suggest that this genuine attempt by the Australian Labor Party Government to improve the international airport terminal in Brisbane had some political overtones. It is true that every move made by the Government to benefit an area or people is opposed by members opposite. They knock every attempt this Government makes which could prove beneficial to the people of Australia. The second contribution was from the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron).</inline> Some research has been conducted into his efforts on behalf of the people of Brisbane. After all one must examine the record of people to see how they have performed in the past. He had been a member of this House for 6 years during which time he made one speech about the Brisbane airport. About ten or eleven months after the Labor Government was elected he suddenly became aware that Brisbane had an airport and he made a few speeches, not that there was much substance in what he said, on the subject during adjournment debates. For somebody who claims - I do not like the cheap politicking that goes on in certain areas - to be interested in people to stand here and say that he has had the interest of the people at heart and we find his approach is phoney, I suggest- </para>

              <para>- I withdraw it. The honourable  member made a claim but in 6 years he made one speech on the question of the Brisbane Airport. It appears that during the period the Liberal-Country Party Government was in office he either had no concern about the people of Brisbane or lacked the fortitude to stand up to those who would do nothing on behalf of the people of that area. I listened to him today and as a result I am convinced he knows nothing about what is planned for the new development of the Brisbane Airport. For somebody who represents the people of Brisbane to be so ignorant of the planning that has gone on in the past and of what is planned for the future is really beyond my comprehension. I have a genuine interest in the Brisbane Airport and in the people who reside in close proximity to it. My interest has been evident over a period of many years. As a private citizen I made a submission to the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise which visited Brisbane to take evidence in 1969. Although it is evident that the honourable member for Griffith has not done so, over the years <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> acquainted myself with plans which were being put forward to develop the airport. Over the years 1 watched as Brisbane became the forgotten city by Liberal governments. The airport is in my electorate of Lilley. </para>

          <para>In 1962 when this area was represented by another Labor Party member an attempt was made by Labor Party representatives from Queensland to have something done about the Brisbane Airport. They had a deputation to the then Minister for Civil Aviation in the Liberal government. Their attempts bore no fruit because the Liberal government refused the approach that was made. It is all very well for the honourable member for Griffith to hop on the band wagon now when, after 23 years of Liberal neglect of Brisbane, finally something is to be done for the airport area, but the people of Brisbane are well aware that the Liberals were masters at producing plans and at subsequently shelving them. The dumping of the people of Brisbane and the neglect of the people who use the airport facilities were permitted without a fuss being raised by government supporters representing Brisbane city electorates. 1 have referred already to the somewhat puerile attempts by the honourable member for Griffith today to grandstand. I have referred to his past performances. Let us examine the performances of my predecessor who sat here for 9 years. I have had information taken out by the Parliamentary Library about the speeches and questions of my predecessor. On 10 May 1966  -  almost 8 years ago - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Cairns made his first reference to the Brisbane Airport in a question. He then asked: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline>; then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr ;</inline> Swartz replied: </para>

            <para>An extensive program of works is being undertaken to improve facilities at the Brisbane Airport.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I will not read the whole of the answer, but this was in 1966. In speaking to the Appropriation Bill on 21 September 1966 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Cairns, my predecessor, made some brief reference to the Brisbane Airport. According to the Parliamentary Library his next reference to the Brisbane Airport was on 15 April 1970. Brisbane had been forgotten and neglected by the Liberals. These references reveal the interest of the representative of the Lilley electorate at that time. He addressed a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>My question .... concerns development at the Brisbane Airport whereby activities will be moved <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the north and east towards Moreton Bay and away from the residential areas. Will the Minister investigate whether, as part of this movement land acquired from the Brisbane Turf- Club nearly 30 years ago, the acquisition of which caused the abolition of the famous Straight Six at Doomben, could be re-acquired by the club? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The answer was that it was a major operation. The Minister said that he would look at the question and bring it to the attention of his colleague. This was the kind of representation provided by Liberals representing electorates within the city. of Brisbane. It reveals their concern about the Brisbane Airport. One honourable member made one speech in 6 years and the other asked 2 questions, one about the Straight Six at the racecourse, and made one speech. The honourable member for Griffith sat silent in this House for 6 years. When he became aware that the Labor Government was moving to correct the result of years of Liberal neglect he started to raise the question of the Brisbane Airport. I was rather astounded today when he claimed some credit for the proposed improvement of the international terminal complex. I am proud and happy that while the honourable member for Griffith slumbered I was able to toil on behalf of the people I represent. </para>

          <para>I have referred to what has occurred in the past. Just to prove the point I am making 1 have taken some information from Department of Civil Aviation reports over the years. In the 1966-67 report there was no mention of Brisbane. The Minister for Civil Aviation at the time was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Swartz, a Queenslander, who used to land at and take off from Eagle Farm airport quite frequently. In the 1966- 67 report Sydney, Melbourne&#39;s Tul lamarine and Perth airports got a mention but there is not one word about Brisbane. In the 1967- 68 report Sydney and Melbourne airports received quite an amount of prominence. About 4 lines were set aside for Brisbane. It stated: </para>

          <para class="block">That plan was not proceeded with. That was one plan the Liberals dropped in their neglect of Brisbane, its airport and its people. In the 1968- 69 report Brisbane did not receive one word of mention. In the 1969-70 report there is a heading for Queensland but there is no mention of Brisbane airport; there is a brief reference to proposals for Rockhampton. In the 1970-71 report is a reference to the joint Commonwealth, State and local government advisory committee which was established in 1970-71 to review future development of Brisbane airport. The report states: </para>

          <para>The international terminal is the subject of the motion before the House today. Back in 1966 a Liberal asked a question about it. Successive Liberal governments in the intervening period took no action to provide an improved terminal at Brisbane airport. Now a Labor government has at heart the concern of people who use the terminal and people who work at the terminal and is taking steps to try to hurry this work along in order that a fire hazard that this present building represents can be removed and so that other hazards connected with it can also be removed. In Brisbane the present building has been a sick joke. It has been used against Brisbane over a number of years. It is an igloo type of building of timber and galvanised iron construction which was built during the Second World War. I am told that in winds above about 55 knots everybody in the building has to be evacuated. The Liberals should be proud that in the capital city of Queensland, a tourist State, the international terminal has been neglected to such a degree after 23 years of Liberal rule that when winds reach 55 knots - that is not such a high velocity - everybody has to be evacuated from the building. It is not air-conditioned. People are frustrated when they are waiting in their hundreds for their aircraft or to meet people. I am told that at peak hours about 250 to 300 passengers an hour are in the terminal. To this can be added about 800 or 1,000 people who are meeting or farewelling people. We will be farewelling the honourable member for Griffith, the honourable member for Petrie and others in the future when they are replaced. One can imagine the frustration of travellers in the hot Queensland summer. </para>
          <para>The Liberals have the temerity to come before the House today and to condemn a government which has taken positive action to provide an improvement for Brisbane. I am proud to be associated with it. I am very happy with the good work the Government has  done  on behalf of the people of Brisbane. Finally, after years of neglect we will see an improvement in our airport. Brisbane will have something to be proud of. </para>

So the honourable member should be decent enough to concede the fact that I too made representations to the previous Minister for Civil Aviation. But regrettably-- </para>

            <para>-  I want to make one or two observations about this motion. The reasons for the urgency in getting on with the project which were given by the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> are matters which I would agree with entirely. However, it is strange that these considerations did not prompt the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> into doing something about the project in the last Budget. When the Bud get was introduced I recall that the Coombs Report was tabled with it, in which there was a clear recommendation which was adopted by the Government at that time, that the only money to be made available for the Brisbane airport was $6.5m for acquisition of land. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The report also went on to say that plans were in hand by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government to resite the runways. That is the important and expensive part of the project. The international terminal is window dressing. After all, the number of international flights which go in and out of Brisbane is relatively small when compared with the large number of internal flights in and out of the same airport. It would have been much better usage of money to spend it on upgrading the technical aspects of the airport such as the resiting of the runways further towards Moreton Bay which would not only increase the capacity of the airport to handle air traffic but also would alleviate the problem which the report mentions of noise nuisance to residential areas and a restriction on the height of buildings in the centre of Brisbane, which of course is under the flight path of aircraft using the present airport. </para>
          <para>These are much more important matters than simply some prestige building for international visitors. While I do not suggest that this project ought not to be gone on with, I suggest that it is remarkable that last August the Government found that this project was not very urgent at all. All of a sudden when we were faced with a double dissolution and a general election for this House and the Senate last Monday we heard the first announcement of money to be spent on Brisbane airport. Where, may I ask, is the money to come from? Out of which appropriation vote in the Budget last year is this additional money to come? Also on last Monday we had the announcement that the money was to be spent. Today we have a motion that the Public Works Committee be bypassed so that the work can be started and capital can be made out of it by the Government in order to support the shaky chances of the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Doyle)</inline> at the next election. The motives of the Government in proposing this motion are what I challenge, not the fact that the money ought to be spent on the international air terminal. </para>
          <para>It is also interesting to note that pressure was being brought to bear on the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> following his appointment to the board of Qantas Airways Ltd of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egerton.</inline> I think it was in January that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egerton</inline> made the announcement that if the Minister for Transport did not make money available to upgrade the facilities in the Brisbane international air terminal, he would make sure that Qantas built the terminal. Apparently then there was an interchange of views betwen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egerton</inline> and the Minister for Transport. It is no wonder that the building is now going to be built because that particular gentleman has had plenty of experience in industrial blackmail. Be that as it may, the fact of the matter is that this matter was raised repeatedly by the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron).</inline> For weeks he was ignored by the Minister for Transport on this subject. The honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Doyle)</inline> made his speeches in the House only after the matter had been raised by the honourable member for Griffith. Normally in the adjournment debates last year they followed in tandem. The honourable member for Griffith would raise the subject, and make a speech on it and he would be followed by the little echo from Lilley dragging along behind. I think it is worth while reminding the House of the efforts that the honourable member for Griffith has made in promoting the Brisbane Airport. It is also worth while reminding the House that the Government which now sees great urgency in introducing this particular motion to get the work on the international air terminal started, saw no urgency when the Budget Papers were being drawn up. This is just another example of the way in which this Government has channelled funds into the bigger States and the bigger areas of Sydney and Melbourne to the grave disadvantage of smaller places like Brisbane. It is only now when the Government is in electoral trouble that the people of Brisbane are being considered. While. I would not oppose the expenditure of money on the Brisbane Airport, I do oppose the way the Government has gone about it. I am sure that the people in the electorate of Lilley and in other electorates in Brisbane will not be deceived or gulled by the action of this Government in its panic state. </para>

            <para>- I want to clear up a few points.&#39; First and foremost it is perfectly true, as I said on a previous occasion, that I knew that the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Donald Cameron)</inline> was speaking on the adjournment. It was reported to me, incidentally, not by the honourable member. My staff drew to my attention on Monday night that the honourable member was speaking on the adjournment about the Brisbane Airport. I give him the same answer today as I gave him late last year, that is, that when his own Party takes him seriously and treats him seriously and not for what he is, I will treat him seriously also. That is the situation. The Liberal Party treats him as a nobody, so I give him the same treatment. In any case, when cousin Clem is finished with him in a few weeks time he will not even be here. He is one of the Jones family. When the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones, has dealt with the honourable member that will be the finish of the honourable member. </para>

              <para>- During all the period he was a member supporting the Government and on one occasion only did he see fit to raise the question of the Brisbane Airport. He was a supporter of a Party that had been in government for 23 years until December 1972. That is how much real interest he had in raising the question in this place to make sure that Brisbane got rid of the igloo which serves as an international terminal. That is his record. The honourable member for Griffith says: &#34;The Minister knows that when he was a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise I appeared before the Committee and gave evidence&#39;. The honourable member appeared before the Committee for one reason, namely that he thought it was politically discreet that he do so. The honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Doyle)</inline> also appeared before the Committee of which I happened to be a member. I was the one to whom the honourable member was referring. Everyone had a go. It was open season on the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. </para>

          <para>The difference between the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Lilley then was that the honourable member for Griffith at the time of the Committee hearings was a Government supporter but he did nothing about the problems that beset Brisbane. The Government did nothing about them. That is the difference between the 2 honourable members. The honourable member for Lilley supports the present Government which is doing something about them. That is the difference between the activities of the 2 honourable members. The honourable member for Griffith got nowhere, and the honourable member for Lilley has got somewhere, and that is why all honourable members opposite are bitching here today over what is going on. That is why the honourable member for Griffith, the honourable member for Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cooke)</inline> and all the rest of the Opposition are going crook here today. The honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> raised the phoney issue of the matter not being referred to the Public Works Committee. This is why all Opposition members are whingeing here today. They are whingeing because the Government which they supported did nothing and the present Government is doing something positive. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the facts of the matter. The original scheme proposed by the Liberal Party was to extend the existing north east-south east runway, first of all, by cutting off about 4000 feet at the north east end and then extending it further down. Money was provided to resume land at Pinkenba. The land resumed is not altogether necessary under the present scheme, but some of it will come in handy. It was not necessary for the previous Government to have resumed all the land that it did. Honourable members know now what the former Government intended to do. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Griffith referred to the contents of the Coombs report. Of course the report sets out a timetable of expenditure. The previous Government also had a scheme, which I have just outlined, but it did not go on with it. I tabled today the former Liberal-Country Party Government plan dated January 1972. I emphasise that date - January 1972. The previous Government was defeated in December 1972. Was all this money necessary for its plan? The report prepared for the previous Government was completed in January 1972. Was it going to be another one of those airy fairy dreams of Bob Cotton and Reggie Swartz about what the Government was going to do in regard to the Brisbane airport? Why did the previous Government not include provision for the scheme in the 1972-73 Budget? I ask honourable members opposite to answer that question. The previous Government did not include the money in that Budget only because it was typical of the humbug that it had indulged in for 23 years. It was never prepared to do anything about the Brisbane Airport. It had an igloo there. The only reason that TransAustralia Airlines got a new airport terminal was that its original premises were burnt down. That is why we are worried about this one. We are prepared to go ahead with this. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Wakefield was concerned that the Government had not referred the matter to the Public Works Committee. We are not referring it to the Public Works Committee for one very simple reason, and that is that there is going to be a double dissolution of this Parliament within the next couple of days and we want - </para>

              <para>-  Yes, it is good. You fellows will not be here after it. In particular, the honourable member for Griffith will not be here after Clem Jones has finished dealing with him. The whole question comes around to the fact that the Government has by-passed the Public Works Committee because it wants to get on with the job. The Government wants the new terminal operative in the year 1975-76 because of the intolerable conditions under which the former Government allowed the people in the aviation industry in Brisbane to operate. Every time there is a storm in Brisbane the terminal has to be vacated. During the recent cyclones in Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> international terminal was vacated under instructions of the Department of Transport. Do honourable members opposite want the terminal to remain in that condition? The previous Governemnt was prepared to do so and, as I said a moment ago, honourable members opposite are whingeing because they did not do the job and we are going to do the job. That is the difference between the two. </para>

              <para>- We will be here to do it, do not worry about that. I will make sure that the honourable member for Lilley opens it. The reason why the honourable member has not asked  any questions during this session is because they told him that the report was under way and that it would be coming out. Honourable members opposite talk about this proposal being an election gimmick. The fact of the matter is that one does not get the Bureau of Transport Economics to prepare a report in 5 minutes. It became obvious only a week ago that the Senate was trying its arm out and that the Parties opposite would refuse supply. One does not prepare a report like this in a matter of a week. The report: is dated March 1974. The report and the submission were presented to Cabinet last Sunday. They would have been presented in any case because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gross,</inline> the man who is responsible for handling this matter in the Department, and myself worked on the assumption and the knowledge we had about the report and decided what we were going to do with it months ago. So the situation is that this proposal would have been put forward in any case. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Honourable members opposite are just trying to hold this work up as they held it up when they were in government. They want to hold up this work by referring it to the Public Works Committee. But the Public Works Committee will be out of existence after today. That means that the terminal will not be built by the summer of 1975-76. That is what honourable members opposite want. We are determined that there will be a terminal by that time. We will avoid  the risk of people being killed in the event of the old building collapsing or catching fire, as happened with the Trans-Australia Airlines terminal. These are the things that we are out to correct. </para>
          <para>The proposal is outlined in the Advisory Committee report on the 1970-71 review of primary airport facilities to serve the future needs of Brisbane. This report has been referred to the Bureau of Transport Economics for a full and detailed report on the economics of the Brisbane Airport. We are not going to wait until that investigation is completed because we realise that we have to do something about the international terminal which Reg Swartz and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> when they were the Ministers responsible for civil aviation did nothing about. The Bureau of Trans port Economics, as I have said, is carrying out a full and detailed study of the proposal. It will give us the full facts of.it. </para>
          <para>I notice a report in a newspaper which stated that the proposed terminal is to be situated a long long way from the domestic terminals. If honourable members would only open the report and have a look at it they would see that what we are proposing to do is to use a building which when the full scheme comes into operation will revert and be used as a maintenance depot. The building will be a building quite satisfactory to meet the requirements and standards of international air travel and will be adjacent to the existing north east-south west runway. There will be road access to this runway. There Will be parking facilities adjacent to the terminal. The question is: What more do honourable members want? There is no necessity for an international terminal and a domestic terminal to be situated alongside each other. The international terminal and domestic terminal at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport are not situated together. At Sydney the international terminal is situated on the western side of the north-south runway and on the eastern side is the domestic terminal. Is there anything wrong with that? The airlines provide transport for people who want to go from one terminal to the other. This is what will happen at Brisbane Airport. Transport will be provided for people to go from the international terminal to the domestic terminal and vice versa </para>
          <para>It is very clear that what has upset Opposition members is the fact that the Government of which they were supporters did nothing about providing this building whereas this Government is doing something about it. We want to get on with the job. We do not want to be mucked around by having to delay this proposal by having it referred to the Public Works Committee. There is nothing irregular about what we are doing. The proposal envisages an expenditure of some $3. 7m. Members of the Opposition should stop their whingeing and support the resolution so that we can get on with the job and give Brisbane an international airport, which is something that it never got in 23 years of LiberalCountry Party Government. </para>

            <para>- Rarely have I heard more political humbug than has come from the Government side of the House in regard to this matter. The Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> knows very well the objectives and the aims of, as well as the need for, a Public Works Committee. But what has this Government done? The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> has just said that the Government will go ahead with this proposal without referring it to the Public Works Committee. Let me ask him why we have a Public Works Committee? If he does not know the answer it is time that somebody told him. The reason that we have a Public Works Committee is to give people in the area where work is being done the opportunity to voice their opinions. I am surprised that the Minister for Housing and Construction would support such a measure because he, above all people, as a member of the Public Works Committee, was a champion of the rights of the little people to have a voice in big government expenditure. The Minister for civil aviation, or transport or whatever his portfolio is at the moment, has another think coming if he thinks that the decision as to whether the people should have a voice in what work is to be done should be at the whim of the Government. If the position in regard to the present building is even half as bad as the Minister for Housing and Construction outlined today in this House, then it is an indictment on the Government for not moving earlier. Furthermore, although I hesitate to say this - but the way in which -the debate has been conducted I am forced to do so - it is not only an indictment of the Minister but it is an indictment of the Labor members in the Brisbane metropolitan areas which this provision is designed to serve. If the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Doyle)</inline> knew as much about this proposal as the Minister for Housing and Construction said he knew, what did the honourable member do about approaching his own Government on it? What was the answer that he got from the Minister for Housing and Construction or the Minister for Transport? If he did not get a satisfactory answer from the Government why did he not raise this matter in the House, perhaps in the adjournment debate? I do not think that the position is quite as bad as has been painted by the Government. I think that there is certainly a need for a new terminal. The people of Queensland have waited for many years for many things. We have waited for this terminal. The Ministers who spoke today are among those who have helped to keep expenditure in the lower part of the Commonwealth during the term of this Government. It is only fair that they are now to lose those ministerial cars and ministerial perks that got them up on their feet today with such vigour and determination to support the construction of this terminal. The Government was not in any immediate hurry to bring on this proposal before the double dissolution was suggested. But I believe that the suggestion of a double dissolution was the reason why the proposal was brought forward. The Minister for Housing and Construction should know that there would not need to be the delay he has spoken of as a result of this work being referred to the Public Works Committee. Consideration of this reference could have been expedited. </para>

              <para>- An interjection has been made to the effect that the Committee is to be dissolved today. If that is the case another Public Works Committee will be set up immediately the other government comes back. Even the Minister for Transport said that he does not yet have all the material concerning the proposal. I heard him out of his own mouth assure this House that the Government cannot go on with the proposal immediately because it does not have the necessary information. But there is no reason why the proposal should not be referred to the Public Works Committee. The object was pure political propaganda. </para>

          <para>My main objective in speaking today is to try to preserve the traditions of the Public Works Committee. I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> that the Committee has been a watchdog - I have used that word before - for the people generally throughout this Commonwealth when public moneys of a specified amount are to be spent by the Commonwealth Government. What is happening in this House today is a complete undermining of that very great tradition, that principle which lasted until this Government came into office. If the airport building is as bad as honourable members opposite say it is, if it has been eaten by white ants and if it has been a great fire hazard for 16 months why has the Government allowed it to continue? If the Government had received the advice of the honourable members who say that they know all about it the Government should not have allowed it to continue. If the Labor Party had moved earlier when it came into government it might have had some excuse for taking this action, but it has no excuse for taking it after 16 months of dilly dallying until the Government became nervous about what was going to happen to some of its members in Brisbane. </para>
          <para>The Ministers know this as well as I do. They are well aware of it. But that is not so bad. I do not mind the Government being worried about that. I do not mind it doing everything it can to assist its members. What I am concerned about is the undermining of a Committee which is the protection of the people of the Commonwealth. The Committee will degenerate into nothing but a Party political group, lt will lose the value that it has had over the years. That is what I am so disappointed about. I am sure that the Minister for Housing and Construction in his own heart must regret  -  I would be disappointed in him if he did not - the disappearance of the Public Works Committee as a great protector of the smaller people of the Commonwealth. It is the small people of the Commonwealth in whom the Australian Country Party is so vitally interested. Ours is a great national party. We will protect the interests of the people. We will preserve the Public Works Committee. That is why I am on my feet now - to preserve the integrity of the Public Works Committee, to keep it at a level above Party politics and to keep it free to investigate all the measures that the Government will bring in. </para>
          <para>I regret that those 2 Ministers, when they sit over on this side of the House, will not be able to say &#39;We must not bring politics into it&#39;, because they have already brought politics in. That is the great tragedy of the situation. There is no excuse at all for not referring the matter to the Committee. The Minister for Housing and Construction said himself that the investigations are still going on. If there is an urgency for this matter to come before the Public Works Committee, I am sure that immediately the House is reassembled the Public Works Committee will deal with it as expeditiously as possible, lt would then be ahead of the preparations required to build this terminal. The Government&#39;s action is simply a cheap political endeavour to gain some votes. I suggest that if it is publicised in this way it will react, as it should react, against the very members it is designed to serve. </para>

The contribution of the last  speaker,  the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett),</inline> was most significant because he was making what will probably be his last speech in this House. He was making his maiden speech as a member of the National Party. It was his second maiden speech in this House. He now represents not the multinational Party but the National Party from Queensland. I am afraid that I cannot congratulate him on his speech. It is a shame he used the opportunity to knock this important project for Queensland. </para>

          <para>I will not delay the House very long because the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> has a very important matter to bring before the House. But I think it is important for me to make. a brief statement to counter some of the claims made by the Opposition members. They claimed that this was a political gimmick which was brought on because an election is pending. Let me quote from an article in the Brisbane Telegraph&#39; of Wednesday, 22 October 1969 - 3 days before the Federal election of that year on Saturday 25 October. The article said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Plans at new airport nearly ready. Hie multi-million dollar plans for Brisbane airport were almost ready for submission to the Federal Government for approval, the Civil Aviation Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swartz,</inline> said today. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was on 22 October 1969. Have honourable members ever seen such blatant political gimmickry as they saw that day? That was typical of the last Government which, for 23 vears, did nothing tangible about overcoming the problems of airport development. If I had more time I would read the other cuttings I have here which show that it was just a continuation of the same progress. Promises and broken , promises were all the previous Government was prepared to do about the development of the Eagle Farm airport. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> has been criticised for moving before the reports that his Department will be preparing for his consideration have been completed. The siting of this international terminal has been well explained by the Minister. The Building will be used for another purpose when the airport is re-sited. The Minister has explained to me that the work can proceed at this stage because the proposal has been the subject of a preliminary report, and it is not tied up at all in the ultimate report that is being prepared for the re-siting of the Eagle Farm airport. I say to honourable members opposite who suggest that the Govern- ment is short-cutting the Public Works Committee that the time for full consideration of all the ramifications of re-siting the Brisbane Airport will be when this report is completed and the time the development is to be commenced in the new area closer to the mouth of the river and on the shores of Moreton Bay. At this stage it is adjacent to the existing airport. The site will be almost ready for the construction of the building to proceed. The contract for the site filling as a preliminary part of the work can be let and the work can be under way before the election day so that the people of Brisbane will know at last that the pre-election promises about the Brisbane Airport will be achieved, that the pre-election promises by this Government about the Airport will proceed to the point of completion, not as happened on so many occasions with the last Government&#39;s pre-election promises for the development of the Brisbane Airport. </para>

            <para>- By leave - I table the report of the Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education. The Australian Government has not yet had the opportunity to consider the Committee&#39;s Report in detail, but it accepts and endorses the validity of the broad programs recommended. The report, which I venture to predict will be known as the Kangan report, will revolutionise technical education in Australia. The operative word is education&#39;. The report envisages a major shift of emphasis. It abandons the narrow and rigid concept that technical colleges exist simply to meet the manpower needs of industry and . adopts a broader concept that they exist to meet the needs of people as individuals. These needs include opportunities to attain the highest skills, the most modern technology and the services of a type of education offered, especially in country areas, by community colleges, which I might define as multi-level institutions combining technical and advanced education courses. They can avoid unnecessary duplication with other types of advanced education. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The report takes a long step in the direction of &#39;lifelong&#39; education and of opportunities for re-entry to education. It recommends unrestricted access for adults to vocationally oriented education. It removes barriers discouraging adults. It has particular regard to the needs of women, of country students, of migrants and of handicapped persons. Its initial programs support existing technical colleges, improve educational quality and lay the foundations for marked improvement in the next triennium. </para>
          <para>It envisages an expenditure of $105m in the 18 months commencing 1 July 1974 and concluding 31 December 1975. <inline font-weight="bold">Major items</inline> in this sum. of $105m are $20m to cover fee abolition, since technical colleges have been made free. Equipment and minor works are estimated at $15.09m, a necessary sum to finance the replacement of obsolete and obsolescent machinery and other equipment, and land and buildings $4 1.1 8m, a figure including a matched sum of $6m from the States. The report breaks the exclusive right of other forms of education to student residences- by setting aside $4m for the residences of technical college students. The report deals with a serious situation. In its own words it points out that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Almost 70 per cent of men and over 80 per cent of women in the labour force have no formal educational qualification at the trade, technician or vocational level or a degree. People who become qualified as skilled workers other than at the professional level in the labour force do so in the hard way. They do not have anything approaching equality of access to vocational education with those preparing for a livelihood by attendance at a university or in more recent times at a college of advanced education. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report sums up the remedy: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The concept central to this Report is the provision of unrestricted access to post-school education through government maintained or administered institutions not already assisted through the Australian Universities Commission or the Australian Commission on Advanced Education. Alternatively the major theme can . be described as the removal of barriers from and the introduction of encouragement of entry into technical and further education by all adults. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Among the Committee&#39;s guidelines were some it adopted itself. These were: Firstly, opportunities for technical and further education should be available to people of all ages regardless of minimum formal educational entry requirements or of current employment status. This principle is designed to ensure that throughout life recurrent education should give priority to the needs of the individual as a person and to his or her development as a member of society, including the development of non-vocational and social skills that affect personality. </para>
          <para>The second guideline chosen by the Committee was that the broader the approach in technical and further education the more the likelihood of creating an environment in which self motivated individuals can reach their vocational goals and in which motivation may be regenerated in people who have lost it. There were also guidelines suggested to the Committee in my initial letter. These were: That the assistance given to the States should commence on 1 July 1974; the Committee was to determine needs within priorities; it was to advise how the status of technical and further education might be raised; the development of technical and further education was to be well balanced; it was required to consider the human problems of access to education, of manpower policies, of the range of vocational education available now and needed in the future, and of the quality and volume of resources required to meet needs; its measures of assistance to the States should be additional to the States&#39; own efforts and not substitutes for the States&#39; own efforts; and, the amount, the allocation, and the conditions of financial assistance were to be recommended. </para>
          <para>Since some States seem to have difficulty in assigning resources to technical and further education the Committee has made an important offer of immediate assistance with what I can perhaps call a bonus for efficiency. In its second recommendation out of 30 the report states: $9.81m should be made available for distribution among the States as a general purpose recurrent expenditure grant and a further $9. 81m should be available which individual States may seek approval to apply to recurrent purposes they specify. </para>
          <para class="block">These recurrent sums, whether or not the States draw the whole$1 9.62m are 55 per cent to be spent at the States&#39; discretion and 45 per cent to go for curriculum research and development; the training of professional staff; the development of a central resource centre; publicity to raise the level of community awareness of the opportunities available; counselling services and social work; staff to direct and oversee safety measures - here I might interpolate that the low standards of safety in many technical colleges would not be permitted for one minute in factories - health and welfare of students; in-service training; for the formation of a unit to develop educational specifications for buildings; site plans; and master plans for capital works development and re-development; and for staff for statistical collections concerning student and teacher population and related matters. </para>
          <para class="block">A most interesting recommendation is the third, which is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A specific purpose recurrent expenditure grant of $lm should be made available to the States to work towards furthering the concept of recurrent education and unrestricted access to vocationally oriented education, of which a minimum of 10 per cent should be earmarked for assistance to handicapped persons and a further minimum of 10 per cent to develop facilities to alleviate barriers to access discouraging ethnic groups, including means of converting overseas qualifications to local equivalents. The specific purpose includes the easing of entry requirements for courses, access to assessments or awards of qualification without requirement for formal class attendance, extension of preparatory, bridging, transfer and other courses for educational assistance, including meeting adult needs related to primary and secondary schooling. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Committee was asked to take into account overall manpower policy and national and local occupational requirements; the optimum use of resources; the emerging needs of industry, commerce and governments as they adjust to technological economic and social change; and community attitudes and the needs and aspirations of individuals seeking to undertake courses in technical and further education. </para>
          <para>The report sets out in detail the scope and powers and terms of reference of a permanent Commission on Technical and Further Education, to succeed the Committee, and if members read this section they will see that the Committee has been acutely sensitive to the needs of the States, empowering the projected Commission to take into account cost escalation factors and allowing for supplementary submissions for additional capital funds required because of unforeseen changes in contracting and similar circumstances. </para>
          <para>The concept of technical education is not as precise as some imagine and the concept of further education is a somewhat elusive one. The Committee&#39;s guidelines are therefore creative and valuable. The Committee suggests that at the very least the scope of technical and further education should be: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>all forms of education provided in post-school or other educational institutions by means of which individuals equip themselves for the exercise of occupations in such fields as industry, agriculture, commerce, and community services, and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>all adult education designed to prepare or retrain any person for employment, change in employment or promotion within employment in any branch of economic activity. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">This does not mean that the definition is exclusive and becomes a demarcation obsession. The Committee report states that it does not attach any importance to precise distinctions between institutions. It asserts, in the Government&#39;s view rightly, that overlapping of courses between secondary schools and technical colleges and between technical colleges and colleges of advanced education could be beneficial, because such overlapping could allow adults greater access to recurrent education. <inline font-style="italic">Boldly the report accepts</inline> the proposition that some adults need some aspects of a primary education, to make good the years that the locust has eaten, to compensate for disadvantages of residence in early life in deprived localities, or for migrant, ethnic or linguistic disadvantages. Technical and further education includes agricultural education. </para>
          <para>The section on relevance to employment provides for educational liaison with manpower authorities in government, employer organisations, and employee organisations while never losing sight of the objective that individuals should be able to plan to develop their potentialities, regardless of any of these interest groups. I am particularly grateful for the study of general barriers to access to technical and further education. The Committee faces the special problems of access to technical education opportunities in the rural areas, pointing out that we too readily accept the view that there are too few people in one place to justify expensive educational resources within their immediate locality. </para>
          <para>The Report comments: Local industry and commerce may provide only a limited range of occupation and employment opportunities, and the distance from universities and colleges of advanced education restricts attendance at courses to those able and prepared to live away from home. For rural areas this is a crippling disadvantage. The lack of an educational chance can lead to apathy and disillusion. The report rejects&#39; the concept that courses in country centres should be restricted to those courses directly relevant to local employment only. The Committee affirms its belief that courses available in the country should be diversified as far as possible, even though this will mean grasping firmly the nettle of expense, and that diverse courses can be justified on the basis of an individual&#39;s desire to study near home even though this may later mean leaving the district to obtain employment for which his training, vocational bent, and developed skills are relevant. </para>
          <para>In 1961 9.6 per cent of the labour force consisted of married women. By 1971 the percentage was 18. The report specifically recognises the crucial role that married women have been playing and will continue to play in maintaining the growth rate in the workforce. It specifically seeks to make provision for married women to re-orient their skills or refresh their skills by making tangible suggestions as to the future organisation as to curricula and timetables. The Committee reacts sensitively and creatively to the disabilities experienced by girls and women, married or single, who have greater barriers to access to technical and further education than boys and men. I refer, of course, to psychological, customary, and . organisational barriers, not legal barriers. There is too much orientation towards subjects for girls and subjects for boys. The distinction is invalid. </para>
          <para>The proportion of women enrolled in technical colleges is too low. It involves a waste of potential skills and doubtless a diminution of creativity and happiness. The idea that secretarial studies is the one desirable field for girls needs to be dispelled. Too few women are employed as teachers in technical colleges. The reactionary notion that it is only boys and men who need career and vocational education and training is too powerful and is rejected as totally invalid. This situation is a reflection of the fact that technical educators have been too conservative in their thinking and tend &#39;to follow and react rather than to innovate&#39;. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee is of the view that the proposed Commission should make special provision within its organisation for continuous consultation with State authorities to remove any access problems women have to courses within technical and further education. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The report suggests the ending of a powerful and probably unconscious discrimination against the handicapped in technical and further education. Up to the present, technical and further education has contributed Little to the rehabilitation of handicapped adolescents and adults. The authorities &#39;make no staff provision for continuous examination of the special needs of handicapped adults&#39;. Very few handicapped persons study in technical type institutions. </para>
          <para>The very design of buildings limits chances of access to such education for many of the handicapped. </para>
          <para>The handicapped student is expected to face the insurmountable hurdle of adapting to the college, and we scarcely face our callousness or unawareness of their problems, and do not accept the desirability of adapting colleges to provide for their special and individual needs. There is a model in some respects in the activities of the Commonwealth Employment Service and Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, which services have developed sheltered workshops and have trained the handicapped for placement in work. The Committee points out the value of further education in developing basic skills for the handicapped as an adjunct to the development of capacity in technology, or any other vocational field, including the alleviation of illiteracy. In chapters 3 and 4 the problems of Aborigines, ethnic groups and immigrants are faced. The lack of formal qualifications among women is exceeded by a greater lack in men in some of these groups; and of course the women of the Aboriginal race, ethnic minorities and migrant communities suffer special disabilities. </para>
          <para>To sum up, the Committee&#39;s task was limited to initial action over the period July 1974 to December 197S. The main features of the report are perhaps: The provision of unrestricted access for adults to vocationally oriented education - involving the removal of barriers discouraging adults; the shift of emphasis to needs of people as individuals - this implies that we abandon the concept that technical colleges exist simply to meet the manpower needs of industry; technical colleges should become a competing alternative to universities and colleges - not just through better buildings and services, but by greater attention to course content, student motivation </para>

          <para class="block">and community interest; greater flexibility in entry requirements and in attendance requirements; particular attention should be paid to adapting technical and further education to the needs of women, handicapped, country students and migrants; the development of further education - the concept ranging from adult literacy and primary education to advanced studies and technology as an integral part of the education structure open to all; the provision of better means of pre-service teacher education, in consultation with the Commission on Advanced Education; the report seeks to foster community colleges in country areas - multi-level institutions combining technical and advanced education courses and avoiding unnecessary duplication, the funding to be in the hands of the Commission primarily responsible for the particular courses, in consultation with the other; technical colleges should contribute to developing new approaches to apprenticeship training; initial programs are designed to upgrade existing technical colleges, improve educational quality, and lay foundations for substantial improvements in the next triennium. Issues are raised and solutions proffered as basis for action by a permanent technical and further education commission. The financial recommendations may be summarised as follows: </para>

              <para>-  I express the thanks of the Government and the nation to Myer Kangan and his Committee.  His  Committee included leading figures from State technical and further education systems, so there should be a minimising of problems of mutual recognition of standards and awards as between the States. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kangan</inline> and his Committee have produced a first-class report I regret that the volume of submission to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kangan</inline> and the Committee attach the utmost importance cannot be produced in dme for tabling today.

          <para>Although they do not know it, 400,000 people, mostly young, who are in institutions of education not assisted by the universities, colleges of advanced education or schools commissions owe <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kangan</inline> and his Committee a debt of gratitude. I express my thanks to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> for his immediate recognition of the need for a committee and ultimately a Commission to cover this gap. Finally, I express thanks to the State governments for their action in releasing officers to serve on the Committee, for their granting of access to the Committee to their institutions, and for their meticulous preparation of information and statistics. The history of technical education has never been bedevilled with religious and denominational rivalries, nor seriously plagued with social divisions, privilege, and obvious snobbery. For these reasons one can anticipate that no vested interests will fight the implementation of this report and the Parliament and the nation will recognise that its recommendations are essential. I commend the report to the Parliament. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- The Australian Country Party seeks to associate itself with the statement delivered by. the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley).</inline> A significant reason for wanting to be associated with the statement is that it has brought a refreshing outlook to a rather depressing week. My Party congratulates the Minister for Education upon his meaningful contribution and thought to promoting the idea of education of the whole man and woman. Not only is it essential that man be educated in how to earn a living but also it is terribly important that he learns the complete art of living. If one wanted to be critical of all the governments of all political creeds in the past one could accuse them of showing some neglect in this vital area of technical education. It can be argued that too much emphasis has been placed on the professional type of education. Many people are concerned that unless something is done, as has been indicated by the statement prepared and delivered by the Minister, in the years to come even the very simplest of jobs that requires technical knowledge will not be able to be carried out because there will not be enough tradesmen. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister about women undertaking technical education. We join with the Minister in his remarks. Most of us are aware that women are very competent and very skilled, particularly in the type of work that is called processing work. Those of us who live in rural areas and understand the very great difficulties of country men, women and children iri obtaining access to technical education are appreciative of the new idea of the making available of money for the construction of residences for students who attend technical colleges. When the time comes for the plan to be implemented I hope that some of these residences will be built in the rural cities and rural towns and that they will not all be built in the large areas of education. </para>
          <para>We applaud the moves to make it easier for those who have migrated to Australia to seek a new way of life and to absorb the Australian ethos to have their skills recognised. Far too often in the past, particularly in the engineering field, skilled migrants with a great knowledge of higher mathematics have &#39;been unable to have their skills recognised. So it will be very much appreciated by those people that their problems have been recognised. All honourable members have migrants in this category living in their electorates. The report of the Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education - the Kangan Committee - will probably make it much easier for them to have their qualifications recognised and for them to receive a salary that is commensurate with their very great skills. </para>
          <para>For too long the emphasis placed on the education of handicapped children has been open to criticism. We note with very great pleasure that, according tq this report, an amount of money is to be laid aside in this very important field. Handicapped people can and do play a very important part in the community. More importantly they can become citizens who are happy in themselves and who contribute to the common good and welfare of society. I have noted that agriculture is to be included in the increased emphasis. That is of vital importance because agriculture is subject to pressures from all types of economies, sciences and philosophies. If we are to make available to the farming community all the modern discoveries and the increased technology that comes from research it is vitally important that the farmers of tomorrow have access to education which will allow them to apply the findings and discoveries of science more readily to their own calling. </para>
          <para>I request the Minister to give consideration to a facet to which I wish to refer as far as apprenticeships are concerned. I was rather disturbed to note that in Victoria, notwithstanding the very great moves that have been made to increase the number of apprentices, only 10,000 apprentices were attracted although it was sought to attract 15,000 apprentices. That is roughly two-thirds of what the industry estimates will be necessary in the foreseeable future if society is to function in this regard. I am worried and concerned about not enough allowance being made to the employers of apprentices. I do not think that the present allowance is significant enough to account for the time that is made available by the employers of tradesmen for the training of apprentices. An employer has to pay his employee - be he a plumber, carpenter, welder or fitter and turner - a skilled tradesman&#39;s allowance and the skilled tradesman then has to teach his apprentices. The employer is probably not getting allowed enough as an allowance within the operation of the apprenticeship scheme to compensate him for the time that is taken by the tradesman in imparting his skills to the apprentices. So I would ask the Minister to tike into consideration at some future point the question of reimbursing the employers of apprentices by way of an allowance for the wage structure that they have to pay to their tradesmen whose time is taken up in teaching apprentices. </para>
          <para>I congratulate the Minister on the part of his statement which laid very strong emphasis on the right of the adult person to continue his education even though he may not have had the benefit of a formal education in his youth. That aspect is applicable particularly to the displaced members of the rural community who, in years gone by, probably left school in 5th or 6th grade and who have now found, due to the problems of inflation and the loss of fertility of what was originally virgin land, that they are no longer able to earn a living on their own properties and are faced in middle age with no skills, no finance and a life of hard work as the only way in which to earn a living. I congratulate the people who prepared this report for giving an opportunity to all who are willing and determined to develop their own skills to the best of their abilities irrespective of how old they are. </para>
          <para>In conclusion I wish to say that we of the Country Party applaud the Minister on this statement and ask him to express the thanks of the people to Myer Kangan and the other members of the committee who so generously gave of their own time to prepare a guideline which to us will play a very significant and meaningful part not only in the development of Australia but also in the expression of personality of the many people who would not otherwise have had the opportunity. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to make interim provision for the appropriation of moneys for the ordinary annua&#93; services of the Government for the first 5 months of the financial year 1974-75. The total amount sought in this Bill is $1,804,284,000 for the following services: </para>

The amounts sought for administrative expenses and other services are basically five-twelfths of the estimates for similar services in 1973-74. An amount of $60m is proposed to enable the Treasurer to make advances which will be recovered within the financial year and to make moneys available to meet expenditure on ordinary annual services of the Government, particulars of which will afterwards be submitted to the Parliament. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Does the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> wish to go straight on with the debate? </para>

              <para>- No. May I have the indulgence of the House for a moment? The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> asked me whether the Opposition wanted to proceed with this debate immediately. The answer is no; I want the debate adjourned. I am prepared to move that the debate be adjourned until a later hour this day. I am asking for the indulgence of the House to permit me to speak so that I am not taking up the time allotted to me in the debate. I should make it clear that I want the debate adjourned till a later hour this day as, if I may put it in the clearest language and in the shortest words, when we are returned to government we will need the provisions of the Supply Bill. On the other hand, we are not prepared to pass the Supply Bill until the present Government makes clear exactly what its course of action is. If the Treasurer could inform me of the Government&#39;s proposed action, I would be in a better position to answer his question. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr CREAN</inline>(Melbourne Ports- Treasurer) - As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> understands, this Ml provides moneys for portion of 1974-75. I take the point that whichever party is in government, it is unlikely that the Parliament will assemble much before the end of this financial year, if at all. Normal processes have to go on, whichever party is in government. If this Bill is not passed technical difficulties could arise. This is the only reason why I think we should debate the Bill now. I say, with respect to members of the Opposition, that I think their colleagues in the other place are being rather infantile in the tactics they are employing. My understanding was that the agony would be ended as quickly as possible. Certain technical steps are being taken in the other place. Of necessity, the Government has to take certain steps in this place. With all respect, I doubt very much whether too many honourable members will want to be hanging around this place over Easter. The Government considers the step that it has taken is a necessary technical step. I hope that the Opposition will at least accept our action in that light. I had hoped that the Opposition might simply have passed the Bill. If it will not, I will move that the debate be adjourned. </para>

              <para>- I thank the House. I fully agree with much of what the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> has said. What I am saying is that if the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> would make plain what he is doing and whether he is about to dissolve the Parliament for an election, we would co-operate. At this stage the Prime Minister&#39;s intentions have not been make plain what he is doing and whether we can debate the Supply Bill. I would be prepared then to take the appropriate action, according to what the Prime Minister indicates is his course of action. If I may make it clear to honourable gentlemen opposite, there is no urgency whatever about this Bill if this House is not to be dissolved. But if the House is to be dissolved this matter should be considered urgently. All I am saying is that the Prime Minister should come into the House and make clear what he will do. It will be open then for all parties to take the appropriate attitude. I move: </para>

          <para>This Bill deals with remuneration and allowances for certain statutory office holders. Honourable members will recall that in 1971 the then Minister for Health, the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, gave an undertaking that remuneration and allowances paid on an annual basis to various statutory office holders would be specified by Act of Parliament. This was in accordance with the wishes of the Senate. This Government followed a similar practice when it introduced legislation dealing with the establishment of new statutory offices. Practice has been for legislation to provide for the determination of remuneration by regulation until a specified date, after which the remuneration must be specified in an Act of Parliament. </para>
          <para>The need for this policy has been overtaken by the establishment of the Remuneration Tribunal last year. That Tribunal is now responsible for undertaking reviews of the remuneration of statutory office holders and others. It will do this at least once a year. Its determinations and reports will be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny, in accordance with the terms of the Remuneration Tribunal Act. This Bill is necessary to cover certain statutory office holders established before the Remuneration Tribunal Act was passed. Without passage of the Bill there will be no provision by which salary payments may be made after 1 July 1974. </para>
          <para>All the Bill does is allow existing remuneration to continue to be paid in accordance with regulations until a determination is made by the Remuneration Tribunal. This will ensure that the existing rates of remuneration continue to be payable should there be no determination by the Remuneration Tribunal before 1 July 1974. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker,</inline>I table a report entitled &#39;The Recreational Priorities of Australian Young People&#39;. In the spirit of the Government&#39;s policy of encouraging young people to participate creatively in society, my Department last year commissioned the National Youth Council of Australia to undertake project &#39;Youth Say&#39;. The area of youth was always neglected by our predecessors and yet 16 per cent of our population is between the ages of 12 and 20. This document, the result of this project, is the Kinsey Report on Australian youth, a detailed recording of their hearts and souls, an accurate, almost unedited and honest answer to the question we put to them: What are your needs and wishes in the way of community recreation and leisure opportunities? The study involved some 1,300 youngsters between the ages of 12 and 20 in a process of workshop consultations. We proceeded on the assumption that young people have plenty to say about their community life and we gave them their first opportunity ever to interfere in their own lives- all this in a happy departure from the old maxim that children are to be seen, not heard. </para>
          <para>We have several aims with this document. We want to stimulate discussion on the needs of young people in Australian society. We want to create an awareness that young people not only have their own views but also a very genuine desire and need to communicate these views. We must provide for youth to be involved in discussions and activities affecting community life. We must at long last concede that they are part of this life and not just sitting on the edge of it waiting to grow older. One quote from the Report says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What youth have had to say can now be heeded &#39; by policy makers as they prepare for new initiatives in the youth field work . . .&#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>this report will provide a sound basis for future Government action. If I may say, it is worth being young today. Nobody ever bothered to ask us what our needs and wishes were or how we wanted to spend our leisure time. We were brought up in almost autocratic regimes enveloped in the &#39;father knows best&#39; atmosphere. But does father really know best? We sincerely believe the time has come to let youth have a say in their own affairs - to listen to them and then act. It may be a new and happy experience for future generations to learn how to grow up without hating every minute of it. </para>
          <para>Trends and fads change but youth is eternal. Thirty years ago it was the Andrews </para>
          <para class="block">Sisters - you would remember them well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> - today it is the Rolling Stones; it was the crew cut, now it is the long look. Outward signs have changed but the problems of young people have remained constant. It is fashionable to refer to the generation gap, as some sort of explanation for the apparent communication difficulty between parents and children. This is not new: The gap has existed throughout the centuries. This, report, in conveying the . opinions, attitudes and aspirations of young people will help bridge that gap. It should be instrumental in bringing fathers and sons, mothers and daughters closer together as friends, not as rival representatives of two different ages and periods. </para>
          <para>For a long time we have been speculating and theorising about the problems of youth, offering little more than some aspirin cure for them. But this is the first time that any government has set out to ask the patient just where does it hurt. I commend this report to all honourable members and also to the news media which can play an enormously important part in the building of these bridges to close the generation gap. This is an exhaustive study of what young people in Australia think, feel and want to do. Only by an appreciation of their viewpoint, expressed in these pages, can real understanding be brought about. </para>
          <para>As the report shows, the recreational priorities of youth are extremely diverse. The young people of Australia are saying very emphatically that they feel most of all the need and the preference for social experiences, a sense of community and some personal responsibility for that community. They have lost a sense of belonging. They resent the pervasive, even obsessive, adult passion - as they see it - for order and control and the distrust of young people that goes with it. They are missing appropriate social venues and outlets and have little sense of collective identity associated with their communities. They feel little sense of adventure or challenge about their community life. They feel uninformed, confused and helpless about any facilities or opportunities that may already exist for them to participate more fully in the life of their communities. They find their school experiences and their work opportunities too often frustrating and stultifying. Under existing patterns of community life, they see themselves as the objects of other people&#39;s policies and decision-making. They seek a greater degree of autonomy ind self determination. The &#39;Youth Say&#39; report identifies the central issues for the majority of young people in society and how today&#39;s generation of young people want to spend their leisure. These can be summarised as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are significant variations of interest at different age levels but very little difference in recreational interests between the sexes after the age of 14. </para>
            <para>There is a very strong interest in team sports among boys between the ages of 12 and 14 but this is no longer true for older age levels with young men or at any age level with girls and young women. </para>
            <para>They seek informal, loosely-structured, social pastimes, individual, non-competitive sports, outdoor activities, and creative and cultural pursuits all largely under their own control. </para>
            <para>Their interest in music and the opportunity for participation in music-making is a major preoccupation and aspiration. </para>
            <para>They prize most highly of all the chance to have some space or places which they can make into their own - not necessarily elaborate or expensive facilities. </para>
            <para>They want to belong to &#39;a community&#39; and feel some responsibility for shaping the life of that community. </para>
            <para>They value the help of adult youth workers when it is given in a spirit of a responsive partnership and they declare a need for much help of this kind. </para>
            <para>They want better information services about available recreational resources and easier accessibility to the use of these resources through better transport services, lower fares and more reasonable entry charges. </para>
            <para>They often complain about their schools and other formal institutions, about legal constraints and traditional patterns of adult control. </para>
            <para>There is cause for very serious concern about what they have to tell us about the incidence of drunkenness and drug abuse and what might be the underlying causes of these. </para>
            <para>There are some specific pockets of serious disadvantage and an obvious need to look more closely at these situations and to seek to know more about other similar situations not uncovered by this Project. Some of these situations are direct outcomes of government migration, employment, development and defence programs. </para>
            <para>The young people with whom the project conducted its consultations frequently expressed their hope to group leaders and organisers that there would be continuing opportunities for them to be involved in discussions and activities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The implications in the report spread to all levels of government, voluntary organisations and to the community and home life. In this respect, &#39;Youth Say&#39; is an important social document. There are many suggestions in this report which will influence the future programs of the Australian Government. These relate particularly to specific youth work policies and the claims which they should make on the national budget for new projects. They involve departments and institutions other than my own - Education, Labour, Social Security, Environment and Conservation, Urban and Regional Development, the Council for the Arts and the like. Such projects as envisaged in the report could provide a new role for young people and a new sense of purposeful involvement and responsibility. </para>
          <para>I am bringing the report to the attention of all Government departments - both Australian and State - and to youth agencies so that the deep causes of distress to young people can be recognised and acted upon. There may have to be a critical re-examination of existing policies in some areas. There may develop, for instance, a new concept of community as applied to young people. There are, however, many signs of promise. All sorts of resources are already available to us that need only an imaginative policy in association with the young people themselves to bring them into use. Basically, what is needed is a clear appreciation of the right priorities, much more dialogue, encouragement for those who are best able to tackle the practical tasks, especially among young people themselves, and the development of advisory services. The Australian Government has made a start in this direction. It will continue to foster creative experiment, new opportunities and the systematic dissemination of information. To help achieve this progress, the young people of Australia have at last been given an opportunity to have their say. I commend the report to honourable members.

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australia institute which would develop, coordinate and foster collections, research and displays of historical, cultural and scientific material of national significance. The Committee will be chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr P.</inline> Piggott who is managing director of several Sydney companies and active in the field of conservation. The other members of the Committee will be Professor G. N. Blainey, Professor of Economic History, University of Melbourne; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> W. Boswell,  Chairman,  Atomic Energy Commission; Professor D. J. Mulpaney, Professor of Pre-history, School of General Studies, Australian National Unipersity; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr F.</inline> M. Talbot, Director, Australian Museum, Sydney; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr D.</inline> F. Waterhouse, Chief of Division (Entomology) Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Andrew</inline> Clayton, Member of the Executive Board or the National Parks and Wildlife Foundation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Waters, ex-General  President  of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia. An officer of the Department of the Special Minister of State will be the executive member of the Committee. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s purpose in taking this initiative is not only to advance the cause of knowledge by preserving and developing the heritage of Australians for present and future generations but also to provide a positive focus for our growing national feeling. By any test there is an urgent need to preserve and conserve our historical, cultural and national heritage and to organise its preservation. Development of museums and collections, although widespread and attracting great public interest and dedicated service, has tended to be unco-ordinated and piecemeal. . Indeed some valuable collections are stored in poor conditions with increasing risk of deterioration. Generally museums and collections need to be developed further in a dynamic way so as to discharge their basic educational and other roles effectively. There are, moreover, a number of potential developments proposed by various organisations which require careful examination in the light of overall priorities. </para>
          <para>The proposed Australia institute could take hold of these matters on behalf of the Australian Government in relation to its direct responsibilities and field of interest and could co-ordinate and foster development at State, regional and local levels. At present Australia has no national institution which teels the story of Australia to Australians - the history of aboriginal man, early white settlement and discovery, the gold rushes and so on, through to modern times. Australian achievements in science, technology and the arts are notable and it is important that they be acknowledged in a tangible way. To meet these and other needs the Committee will give particular attention to the establishment of a national museum in Canberra. This is not conceived as a storehouse of things dead and past but as a living and dynamic institution which . would educate Australians about their history and cultural heritage. </para>
          <para>The story of Aboriginal man is an important one and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> joins me in announcing that priority will be given to examining the possibility of establishing a gallery of Aboriginal Australia. Aboriginal Australians are known to have occupied this continent for at least 30,000 years but neither the Aboriginal people nor recent Australians can draw much pride or encouragement from existing displays of their unique history, culture or achievements. To ensure that appropriate and timely attention can be given to the question of a gallery of Aboriginal Australia we will establish a separate committee, including representatives of the Aboriginal people, to examine and report on this important subject. A separate announcement will be made concerning the specific terms of reference and membership of the separate committee which will report to the main committee and be linked to it by Professor Mulvaney, who is  Deputy Chairman  of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and is well equipped to perform this function. </para>
          <para>The Government would see the main committee&#39;s work being undertaken in stages with separate reports being presented at each stage. The Committee would for example, be expected to bring forward, with any comments it considered appropriate, proposals for the establishment of a gallery of Aboriginal Australia if these are received before any of its own reports are&#39; ready. Proposals for the establishment of a national museum in Canberra would also be expected in advance of detailed plans for the establishment of the Australia Institute. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the detailed terms of reference for the Committee of Inquiry. </para>

          <para>- The Australian Country Party welcomes and supports this proposal to establish a committee of inquiry with a view to developing an Australian institute to co-ordinate and to foster collections of national significance. Governments and man in modern societies must continue to search for ways to integrate the arts into society and to involve the public closely with the cultural life of our communities. There has been a separation of the arts from the public. The paradox is that it has occurred at a time of rapid world urbanisation, technological change and automation, when the machine is changing human patterns of work and play. It has, on the other hand, created more leisure time and, I hope, more energy. Greater emphasis will have to be placed by administrative bodies on more support to smaller, even perhaps experimental organisations, together with our creative individuals. Many smaller operating professional groups are working energetically for the arts in our community. They will feel more confident in the long term if such a coordinating body as is proposed can assist them not only financially but also by aiding them in establishing contact with sister galleries and allied institutions. In my electorate the dedicated work of small groups must be given the greatest praise not only for bringing art to our region but also for promoting local participation and an application of the arts in the community. For this reason the Australian Country Party supports the conception of an Australian Institute and the contents of this statement. </para>

          <para>The committee commenced its inquiry in May 1973 and since then has taken evidence from some 56 people and has met on 20 separate occasions. It was the hope of the Committee that the report would be debated in both Houses during the Budget sittings. The present political situation has confused our aims. But I would hope that we can revive the report and that the Houses can vote on the recommendations of the Committee when the Parliament reconvenes. The principal recommendations of the Committee are as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">
              <para>The Committee has found that it is desirable, in principle, to televise the proceedings of the Parliament; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="2.">
              <para>The Committee has recommended that there be a 2-week trial period of closedcircuit televising to enable members to evaluate televising before making a decision on the Committee&#39;s other recommendations. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="3.">
              <para>The Committee has recommended that there be a telecast of question time on the evening of each sitting day and that there be a weekly summary program produced. The Committee has recommended that these programs be telecast on a national basis by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and that they be produced by a special unit to be known as the Parliamentary Television Unit; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="4.">
              <para>Other recommendations of the Committee relate to providing access to parliamentary video-tapes to all television networks for inclusion of material in news, current affairs and documentary programs; to permitting the televising of committee proceedings and to the liberalising of the present rules governing access to the radio broadcasts. The Committee has laid down draft guidelines which are appended to this report. These guidelines carefully prescribe the manner in which any television program might be produced. </para>

          <para class="block">A dissent has been added to the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke.</inline> If this Parliament or future parliaments decide not to accept the Committee&#39;s recommendations I would still hope that this report together with the evidence which has been accumulated will provide the blueprint for planning for the new Parliament House and for planning for television when it eventually does come. Finally, I would like to re-assert my earlier statement. I trust that the Parliament will vote on our recommendations and I would hope that this would be a nonparty vote. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr HURFORD</inline>(Adelaide) - This report on Import Prices (Report No. 2), which has just been tabled, is the fifth report presented to the&#39; Parliament by the Joint Committee on Prices. It covers the commodities of tea, jute, unmanufactured tobacco, fish, textiles and flat glass. </para>
          <para>The Committee has found that for imports of tea and jute landed costs of imports have responded to the upvaluations and the consumer has benefited. Tea prices are less by 5 cents a pound as a result. Although there have been benefits for unmanufactured tobacco, these have been considered by that industry&#39;s leaders to be insufficient to allow a reduction in the price of cigarettes. However, the benefits may have assisted the manufacturers in restraining price increases to date and hopefully should do so in the future. </para>
          <para>Imports of fish and textiles are similar to a host of other products in as much as they constitute clear examples of how and from where inflation is being imported into Australia. In these cases the Committee finds that world shortages have pushed up prices but that upvaluation has lessened these price increases. </para>
          <para>Flat glass is in a different category. Here the benefits of upvaluation have accrued to overseas suppliers because they have quoted prices in and received payment in Australian dollars. Currency changes, therefore, have had no effect. The Committee traces this to the pervasive effect of restrictive agreements that have eliminated price competition between the local and imported products. </para>
          <para>These agreements have been terminated. But there is the much broader principle that applies not only to flat glass but also to all products protected by the tariff. Furthermore, there is the distinct possibility that the continuation of &#39;loyalty&#39; rebates could have the same effect of restricting imports as that of the abandoned agreements. Agreements such as those that existed in this industry and exist in others or practices such as loyalty rebates which still exist in the flat glass industry could restrict imports and thereby usurp the policy function of the Australian Government which has the Industries Assistance Commission to advise it. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt, therefore, that these agreements and practices should be prohibited by legislation. The Trade Practices Act 1972 does not do this. The Commissioner of Trade Practices himself acknowledged this. </para>
          <para>The Committee has therefore recommended that the Parliament should approve restrictive trade practices legislation that prohibits industry agreements and practices which restrict the amount of goods imported into Australia because this is the sole prerogative of the Australian Government and the Parliament. </para>
          <para>I inform the House that this is the third Report in which the Committee has commented on restrictive practices. It did so in its First Import Prices Report (timber), in the Meatmeal Prices Report and now in this one. In this connection I take pride in informing the House that my Committee is the first arm of the Legislature that has asked the Commissioner of Trade Practices, who incidentally has issued six Annual Reports on his operations, to give evidence to it on the effectiveness of the existing legislation. Of course this evidence was limited to the restrictive agreements in the flat glass industry. The Commissioner&#39;s evidence is at Appendix II of this Report and the Committee recommends that the Parliament should take note of this evidence when deliberating on trade practices legislation. </para>
          <para>A dissent has been made from the recommendation that there should be new improved trade practices legislation on the grounds that imports of flat glass do not require the implementation of restrictive trade practices legislation and that the Commissioner of Trade Practices believes that there was not the practical effect in the flat glass agreements. I leave it to honourable members to read the report carefully, particularly the Appendix containing the Commissioner&#39;s evidence, in order the ascertain whether or not there is a meaning for or a justification of this point, of view. </para>
          <para>I commend the report to the House. </para>
          <para>Before you call on the next matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> might I point out that there is an agreement that a motion be moved that the report be now noted. </para>

              <para>- On 25 September 1973 I had the pleasure of presenting to Parliament the first report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety. The report recommended the creation of a national authority on road safety and commented on the constitutional position and statistical needs in the road safety fields. During the intervening months the Committee has devoted its time to inquiring into the environment in which the motor vehicle moves, specifically roads, road engineering, town planning and roadside obstacles. I have very much pleasure in presenting this report to the House. </para>

              <para>-  1 accept that. But rumours are circulating in this place that we are going to sit right through the time normally set aside for the suspension for dinner. I would have thought that that should be understood now before the Opposition is asked to assist the Government in giving leave for anything. Could we have the intentions of the Government? Have they been conveyed to the Leader on our side or to the Whips or anybody? We want to be as co-operative as possible but 1 think that as a matter of courtesy we ought to be told what the Government intends to do. </para>

            <para>-  by leave - Earlier this evening we requested the Opposition to proceed with some important supply Bills and for reasons best known to itself the Opposition said that it wanted the Bills adjourned to a later hour this day. These Bills are exceedingly important. They must be in another place at 8 p.m. It will not take the full tea hour to deal with them. They could easily have been disposed of I would imagine in 15 minutes had they been accepted. But as the Opposition does not agree there is no alternative for the Government but to go through the usual procedures. If these procedures are taken to the full they will take 50 minutes to implement. Quite frankly, the Government proposes to take this course of action unless the Opposition sees fit to co-operate. </para>

I have not been privy to the discussions, if in fact there have been any discussions. So might I suggest that the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> who tells me that his statement will take approximately 15 minutes to make, be given leave to finish his speech. We would be happy to grant leave for him to do so. After con sultation with my Leader and, I hope, with the Leader of the House during these 15 minutes, in which we could ascertain what the Government&#39;s problems and intentions are, we could come to a responsible attitude about it. We could see what the position is after we listen to the Government&#39;s case, if it is prepared to talk to us. So leave is granted. </para>

              <para>- I move: 7 hat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the orders of the day for the resumption of the debate on the following Bills being called on together and the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: Supply Bill (No. 1) 1974-75; Supply Bill (No. 2) 1974-73 and Remuneration Bill 1974. lt should be understood by those opposite that these measures have nothing to do with this session of the Parliament but are to carry on the supply for the first three or four months of the next financial year, 1974-75. They are traditional Bills that generally go through without any opposition. They are necessary for whatever government might be in office. They are a normal procedure, and quite frankly the Government does not intend to be stood over by the Opposition and ask what its intentions are before they are passed.

        <para class="block">These are important measures on which there is generally no disagreement in this Parliament. It is true that probably lengthier time may have been allowed for debate, but the Bills are necessary for any government to carry on the business of the nation, particularly in the first half of the new financial year. The fact is that at this stage the Bills are not acceptable to the Opposition. The Opposition is refusing to pass them. It is obstructively stopping the Government from making this money available and the stopping of payment for all those things so necessary to the running of this country is something that the Government cannot countenance. Had the Opposition, not been obstructive and discontented and, I suppose, downhearted at the prospect that is facing them, these Bills would have gone through easily. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> we did not divide on the motion for the gag because if we had divided, given that normally a division takes 7 to 8 minutes to count, it would have left for discussion on these Bills 7 or 8 minutes. By not dividing on this motion we will have 15 minutes to discuss 2 Bills, one of which provides supply of $ 1,800m and the other of which provides supply of $51 3m. On this legislation which seeks to appropriate $2. 3m this Government allows 15 minutes for debate, but we have 15 minutes only because we did not divide on the gag. If somebody cares to divide $2, 300m by 15 he will get an idea of what sort of a spendthrift government this is, and he will get an idea of what sort of a government this is which treats parliamentary democracy in this way. Then, would you believe it, this Government says that the Senate has no right to review appropriations made in this House? The Government gives 15 minutes to debate legislation appropriating $2,300m, and then it says it ought to go through this House just like that and that when it gets to the Senate the Senate has no right to review it. If ever a situation has demonstrated that this Government has no concept of parliamentary democracy from start to finish, it is this one. If ever anything has shown that there is a determination on the part of the Government to live out its life in deceit and secrecy, it has been this. </para>

              <para>- Dragging out its life, as I am reminded by the honourable member for Corangamite. Here is a government which is so unaware of what is happening that it could not even provide us with the times that it intended to allot for this debate until after the divisions were taken. It was so ashamed of the small amount of time that it kept the time secret, and it was not until the provisions of the House positively demanded that it state the times that it produced the timetable. It is perfectly clear to everybody that this Government has abandoned any sense of decency It was dishonest from the moment it commenced its life as a government, and it will continue to be dishonest until the end of its life as a government. Can anybody forget the promise that was made by the Labor Party in Opposition? Remember that promise: &#39;Under a Labor Government there will be less inflation.&#39;? Inflation has multiplied 3 times. Food prices have gone up 5 times. Dishonesty! Can anybody remember that wonderful phrase in the Labor policy document which said: &#39;Under a Labor government we will reduce interest rates.&#39;? What has happened? Interest rates are the highest they have been since the Rum Rebellion. This Government said that taxation rates were crippling and that it would reduce them but it has increased them by over $ 1,500m this year. The Labor Party said that it would improve our armed forces. That is the only thing that it has lowered. The Prime Minister said that under Labor there would be fewer industrial strikes because, he said, Labor has an understanding with the unions. It has an understanding indeed! The unions are running this country. Honourable members opposite would not know what to do. They just do not understand. </para>

          <para>We made it clear in the House that when we come into government we will need the money which these supply Bills provide. We will need that supply for next year. We have not had an opportunity to examine the Bills to see whether the figures are right. How could we? They were introduced into the House an hour ago. We cannot examine them, but we were prepared to allow them to go through this House when the Prime Minister stated that there would be an election. He still refuses to state that there will be an election. Why? The probability is that Caucus is meeting at this very moment trying to make up its mind. Everybody knows that there was to be a Caucus meeting at 6.15. At 6.15 the Caucus meeting was called off so that the House could continue to sit. What did the Labor Party do? It sent the shadow of the Prime Minister, that very pale shadow of the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Mathews),</inline> into the chamber to listen. No doubt he will be doing the reporting. He will go to the Prime Minister like the good little chap he is and say: &#39;Oh, dear Lord, this is what happened in the House&#39;. </para>

It will sound like a negro spiritual with the words, &#39;Oh, dear Lord&#39;. That is the sort of praying that will be needed. The Prime Minister, this man who is supposed to lead the destiny of this country, this man who is supposed to provide leadership, this man who has that duty entrusted to him apparently does not know to this moment whether he will have an election. If he does know, why does he not say so? Why does he not come into the House and say that there will be an election, the writs will be issued on a certain day, nominations will close on a certain day and the election will be held on a certain day.

              <para>- I am reminded by the honourable member for Hotham that this great leader cannot take a decision until he gets Caucus approval for it. So he has to nurse it to his bosom in secrecy because he cannot announce it. How can the people of Australia have confidence in a government which is being dishonest in every promise it has made, which has been shameful and deceptive in its actions, which appointed a man as Ambassador to Ireland on 14 March and had not disclosed it by 2 April and it was only by the efforts of a pressman that the ambassadorial appointment was disclosed? Then the Prime Minister says: &#39;Well, of course, on 14 March the  Hon.  V. C. Gair became Ambassador to Ireland&#39;. The Attorney-General knew, the Prime Minister knew, yet they allowed that man to sit in the Senate and never raised an issue about it. </para>

          <para>I do not feel any hesitation in reporting to this House that I had a telephone call from the Prime Minister just before 1 o&#39;clock today. The Prime Minister said to me that he would like my co-operation to keep the Senate sitting after 5 o&#39;clock because he would like these Bills to go through the Senate today. I said: &#39;Well, I will co-operate with you, but I would like you to co-operate with me by telling me the date for the issue of writs, the date on which nominations close and the election day&#39;. &#39;Oh&#39;, he said, &#39;I do not know that I can do that&#39;. Why could he not do it? Caucus had not told him, so he could not tell me. This man, the leader of this country, is going to ask the Australian people to allow him to continue to lead this country. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>we have precisely 3 minutes left to discuss the appropriation of $2,300m. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> either does not know the dates for the closure of nominations, the issue of writs and the election because Caucus has not yetapproved them or there is another possibility - I think this is a real possibility - he is dreaming up some political skulduggery. The whole of the Australian nation, and everybody in the House, has assumed that we are to have an election. The Prime Minister, for reasons of advancing his own political case, is prepared to abandon the national interest entirely and try to serve a narrow political interest of his own. He therefore will not say it.  His  problem is this: There is in Tasmania a Liberal Party candidate named Michael Hodgman who is a member of the State Parliament. He would need to retire from the State Parliament 14 days before nominations close to be eligible to stand for the seat of Denison. The Prime Minister knows that Michael Hodgman will win Denison by a mighty majority. The Prime Minister, if he closed nominations early enough, could disqualify Michael Hodgman from standing. </para>

              <para>- That was the Government Whip, the honourable member for Wide Bay. I hope that he enjoys being Government Whip for these remaining few hours, because he is coming to the end of an undistinguished period of service in this House at the next election. He deserves his fate when he supports a man who is able to contemplate a national election in which political opportunism, conspiracy and skulduggery are applied against a man who has the right to present himself to the people for election. There are 2 possibilities. Either the Leader of the Government, that is the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, that is the Prime Minister, the Leader of this country does not know what he can do, when he can do it or how he can do it, or else he is guilty of skulduggery. It is one or the other. </para>

              <para>The Law Society of Western Australia has written to me expressing the view that there is no call for another legal aid organisation in Western Australia.

              <para>I have informed the Law Society that the Australian Government has decided to establish the Australian Legal Aid Office to provide greater legal assistance to persons in need. I pointed out that an Australian Government service of this kind must be readily and equally available to all citizens of Australia and it was not therefore possible to accede to the Society&#39;s suggestion of using its Legal Advice Bureau instead of setting up an office of the Australian Legal Aid Office. 1 believe that the task of providing an adequate, ready and equal service in the field of legal aid is too great for the private profession to bear alone and that there are areas in which the service can best be provided by salaried lawyers. Equally, there are areas where the service can best be provided by the private profession. I have written to the  President  of the Law Society asking it to let me have proposals for extending the legal aid services provided through the Law Society with a view to considering provision in this year&#39;s estimates for an Australian Government grant to supplement existing legal aid schemes. </para>

It is not proposed to make a decision on this matter until the Committee&#39;s recommendations are made and examined. </para>

          <para>The reason for the eviction proceedings was nonpayment of a rental increase.

Neither increases had been paid by the couple concerned although the increases have been accepted by all other residents.

If the discussion is not considered to be satisfactory to the Director-General, the Committee further recommended that he be empowered to make the amendment of such rule a prerequisite to the granting of any further subsidy to the organisation. I would consider that a rule forbidding a resident of a home from making any public statement would be regarded as repressive and contrary to normal civil liberty. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the right honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) It has been long-standing practice to attempt to develop non-defence workload for the defence production factories in period of low defence demand. Although certain factories are highly specialised, there are skills and plant which can be brought to bear for non-defence purposes. The Government is aiming to achieve a more satisfactory utilisation of those resources. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The overall effects of indirect taxation measures on the Consumer Price Index cannot be measured precisely. A major difficulty is that increased taxation has dampening effects on demand pressures but the ultimate impact of that on the Consumer Price Index is indirect and cannot be quantified. </para>
            <para>Calculations of the direct effects can, however, be made. In regard to the two major indirect taxation measures announced in the 1973-74 Budget, namely the increases in duty on motor spirit and on cigarettes and tobacco products, the direct effects on the CPI are estimated to have been about one quarter and one half of an index point respectively. In addition, the effects of the abolition of the exemption from sales tax of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages containing not less than five per cent of Australian fruit juice on the CPI is estimated to have been about one quarter of an index point. Overall, the direct effects on the CPI of the indirect taxation measures taken in the Budget would have been of the order of one index point which, given the level of the index (144.6 in the December quarter), would have been less than one percentage point. </para>

Representatives at the meeting were in agreement that while the present range road could not be incorporated as part of the Stuart Highway without major disruption of the range&#39;s function, it should be possible to establish an acceptable alignment across the Woomera prohibited area which would not interfere to an unacceptable extent with the operations of the range. This would require a detailed survey and feasibility study, and in the Bureau of Roads &#39;Report on Roads in Australia 1973&#39;, it is suggested that a corridor study of the Port Augusta-Alice Springs segment be undertaken. </para>
          <para>The results of any detailed study undertaken to establish the alignment of a possible National Highway section within the Woomera Prohibited Area will be considered for incorporation in published documents. </para>

              <para>The Tanzanian Government has not practised religious and racial discrimination. Numbers of Asian, African and European residents have departed from Tanzania, since that country&#39;s Independence. This has been largely a reaction to Tanzania&#39;s egalitarian policies applied without discrimination to African and non-African alike. Among the more notable of those Africans to leave Tanzania voluntarily was the former Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oscar</inline> Kambona, subsequently accused by the Tanzanian Government of receiving illegal payments from foreign governments and of embezzling public funds. Although the situation on Zanzibar has been less dear, the present leadership there, as  President  Nyerere indicated during his visit, is seeking to counter the worst effects of a violent revolution and reactions to years of abuse which stemmed from foreign domination including the slave traffic centred on the island of Zanzibar. </para>
