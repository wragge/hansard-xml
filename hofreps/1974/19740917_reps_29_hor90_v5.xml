          <para>That this House expresses its profound sorrow at the death on 9 September 1974 of Her Excellency Lady Kerr, wife of the Governor-General, and places on record its appreciation of her meritorious public service and conveys its deepest sympathy to the members of her family. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Lady Kerr, for all her eminence as wife of the Governor-General and for all the lustre she brought to the role of consort, was a woman of distinction in her own right- a woman of rare qualities and remarkable gifts. She worked for much of her life in community causes. She was an active social worker, hospital almoner and marriage counsellor. She was the devoted and capable mother of a talented family. She was the close companion of her husband throughout his splendid career. She will be missed, above all, for herself. </para>
        <para>It is a cruel blow that she was taken from us so soon and that Australia has lost the services of a woman richly equipped to support her husband in the high and difficult office he has undertaken for Australia and her people. Honourable members will recall that she was among us here on only one occasion- on the day her husband was sworn to the highest office an Australian can hold in his own country. Our thoughts at this time go out to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr. I am confident that the memory and example of his wife, the qualities of her mind and heart, will sustain him in his time of sorrow and strengthen him in the years ahead. </para>
        <para>Last Thursday you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and I were among those who attended a memorial service for Lady Kerr at St James Church, King Street, Sydney. Some of us had known and admired her for a third of a century. In that historic church at the head of Phillip Street, next to Greenway&#39;s Supreme Court building, where 36 years before she was married and where in the years between she had been a communicant member, we were bidden to give thanks for her life of affection and generosity, of personal concern and community service, for her high ideals and steadfast courage. I know that all honourable members will share those sentiments. </para>

          <para>- All Australians regret the tragedy that has befallen the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr, and his family. Lady Kerr&#39;s death was a quite crippling blow to him, coining so soon after he had accepted Australia&#39;s highest office. He has reached the pinnacle of a distinguished public career and in such he should have had, we would have hoped, the support of Lady Kerr in the discharge of his duties. The fact that she will not be there with him brings an understanding on our part of the difficulties that he will have. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Lady Ken&#39;s death was all the more tragic because Australia has lost a woman who had a fine personal quality and who gave dedicated community service over a long period. It is a loss that will be felt widely among many community organisations with which she worked, such as the Marriage Guidance Council of New South Wales. Lady Kerr was a trained social worker. She was committed to the need to provide counselling and support to married couples facing stress. She was an executive member of the Marriage Guidance Council. In addition, Lady Kerr was a volunteer counsellor with the Life Line organisation and served on its adoption committee. </para>
        <para>Lady Kerr continued to give this service to the community despite personal hardships that afflicted her.  Her  courage in overcoming those hardships was the finest example any person could have given of an individual&#39;s self determination to make a positive contribution, despite personal needs, to the service of the community and the nation.  Her  life exemplified a spirit of thought for others before herself. All Australians will recognise the difficulties <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John,</inline> the Governor-General, must now inevitably face and the sorrow his loss must cause him. Australians will extend personal sympathy to him and his family. The task ahead of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> will not be easy but in facing it he can know that he has the full support and understanding of his fellow Australians. On behalf of all members of the Liberal Party I extend sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> and his family in the loss of a distinguished woman. </para>

          <para>- I should like to associate the Australian Country Party with the expressions of condolence of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr, our Governor-General, and to express our sorrow at the sad loss of his wife. He was appointed as Governor-General during a period of her illness but she showed enormous courage in not weakening for one moment during his promotion to that very high office. She was a lady who devoted her life to helping other people. She had enormous ideals and was a great example to the nation. In particular, she was very concerned with the preservation and the strengthening of the family as the foundation of our society. The circumstances are particularly sad in that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> lost his wife so soon after assuming his important position. The office of Governor-General is indeed a lonely one but is now made ever so much more lonely for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> in not having his partner. Our sympathy goes to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> with our understanding of the very sad position that he is in at the moment. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Norman Kirk&#39;s death was a deeply tragic loss for New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific region. New Zealand has lost a great leader. Australia has lost a firm friend. The Pacific and South East Asian region has lost a forceful and creative spokesman. The cause of democratic socialism throughout the world has lost one of its pillars of strength and sources of inspiration. </para>
        <para>My own sense of loss is acute and personal. Both of us came to the leadership of our Parties after the elections of 1966 and to office as Prime Ministers within a week of each other in the elections in 1972. We shared a common ground of political experience in good times and bad and an identity of basic beliefs which gave a closeness and value to our personal relationship quite beyond the ordinary. He was a man I knew well, a man I admired, a man whose personal qualities of integrity, compassion and sturdy common sense earned him the confidence and affection of all who had the privilege of working with him. </para>
        <para>In no country save his own has his death been felt more keenly than here in Australia. Under his Prime Ministership relations between New Zealand and Australia reached a degree of cooperation and understanding of unprecedented intimacy and trust. We co-operated particularly closely in our opposition to nuclear tests in the Pacific. His opposition to those tests was an example to the world and an inspiration to all who supported him. It made him the natural and respected spokesman of the emerging community of Pacific potions- a community whose needs and aspirations, he understood better than any other leader in the world. </para>
        <para>A week ago at the memorial service in St Andrew&#39;s Church&#39; in Canberra I quoted the words he used tb describe his approach to foreign policy soon after his Government was elected. They were: &#39; </para>
        <para class="block">We believe in the individual human worth and dignity of every man, woman&#34; &#39;and child, regardless of race or colour . . . Every action a people takes in international affairs is an announcement of the kind of people they really are. We know -that in-.their daily lives New Zealanders are decent, humane. people. My aim will be to ensure that New Zealand&#39;s actions abroad are in character. </para>
        <para>We met on. 5 occasions during his term of office- in Wellington, in Christchurch, in Apia, in Ottawa and. in &#39;Canberra. He last visited this country in November to open the chancery of the New Zealand&#39; High Commission. On each occasion I sensed a deepening and strengthening of the relations between our countries. It meant much to us that Labor Governments in both countries had, signed the Australia-New Zealand Agreement- the A.N.Z.A.C Pact- in 1944. Norman Kirk worked tirelessly to uphold the spirit of that agreement. </para>
        <para>From -the beginning of his Prime Ministership the co-operation between us was demonstrated in many; small but significant ways. One of the first decisions of his Government was to provide places for up to 100 Australian students to train in New Zealand as dental therapists. Again, he and his Government agreed readily in January last year&#39; to make available the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodhouse as head of the Australian Government&#39;s committee of inquiry into a national, compensation and rehabilitation scheme.. .There were frequent and cordial discussions between his ministers and mine. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>early background was one of personal hardship and deprivation. He left school at the age of twelve. He joined the New Zealand Labor Party at the age of twenty and entered Parliament in 1957. From then on his rise was spectacular and confident. He was elected Vice-President of the Labor Party in 1963 and went on to become the youngest elected leader of the party in its history. He won a record majority in his own seat of Denham in the elections in 1969. , In 1970 he was elected  Chairman  of the Asian Bureau of the Socialist International. In 1972 he became Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs at the age of 49. During all this time. he worked to revitalise and modernise the workings of his party. </para>
        <para>He worked tirelessly to improve and develop New Zealand&#39;s welfare state, already one of the most advanced and humane in the world and largely a memorial to his country&#39;s first Labour Government. He was an ardent supporter of peace, an architect of Pacific economic and political co-operation, and a staunch opponent of racialism in any form. All of us who attended the funeral service for him in Wellington were impressed by the manifest grief of the Maori community whom he served and loved. The Maori people, and countless representatives of the South Pacific nations, were present in great numbers in the cathedral and in the streets outside. None of us who heard the. Maori lament at the culmination of the cathedral service will ever forget its haunting beauty and heartfelt intensity. </para>
        <para>It is a tribute to the esteem and affection in which he was held by Australians that so many of this country&#39;s leaders attended the funeral service. I was accompanied by the Minister for the Media and the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation and our wives, the Leader of the Opposition, the Chief of the Air. Staff, the  President  of the Australian Labor Party, in our midst was Dame Annabelle Rankin, who has now come home after her term as High Commissioner term in which she had become a most effective spokesman for Australia, a well-loved figure among the New Zealand public .and a personal confidante of the late Prime Minister. </para>
        <para>I have no doubt that Norman Kirk &#39;s relentless capacity for work helped shorten his life. He died in the service of his people. He has left the country richer and prouder because of his leadership. He was a man who believed deeply in the essential goodness of the ordinary man. He was a man whose own goodness and decency were reflected in the quality of his public life, in the greatness of his leadership and in the dedication he showed in all his words and deeds to the welfare of his country and its people. </para>

          <para>- Norman Kirk, who was Prime Minister of New Zealand, recently died; hence we have this motion today. It is appropriate that we should move a motion in an understanding of the true depth of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. I can think of no other 2 countries whose interests are so identified and whose people are so similar. In fact there are many New Zealanders walking about Australian cities and Australians walking about .New Zealand cities who would never be identified as coming from one or other of the countries but who would be identified as coming from either of the countries. There is no capacity to distinguish from any of their characteristics or their way of speaking. Because of that closeness the death of Norman Kirk naturally had an impact on Australians. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Norman Kirk, in a short period, had received a tremendous amount of notoriety for his achievements in New Zealand. He also, of course, became very closely identified with the South Pacific and with South East Asia. He was almost the same physical size as the largest of the South Pacific islanders. He had that strong build which I think made him able to communicate with the islanders as readily as they could with him. They recognised that he did not see a leadership role for New Zealand or for any other country in the South Pacific region; what he saw was a spirit of co-operation between all and that there was no single leader, whether it be a country or person- just a need for co-operation. </para>
        <para>He carried that spirit into South East Asia. In South East Asia he was very well respected. He was seen as a leader of a country which wanted to make whatever friendly contribution could be made in co-operation and in no sense intended to intrude New Zealand or its interests into those of the countries of South East Asia with which he was dealing. The same was true, I think, of his relationships with Australia. He recognised them for their intrinsic worth and for their inviolability, and he wanted to make his contribution. He did make a contribution. I hope the contribution he made in all these fields will be well remembered and will never in any way be detracted from. </para>
        <para>One particular matter in respect of which a great deal of publicity was given to the efforts of Norman Kirk related to nuclear testing in the Pacific by France. I think it is probably true to say that Norman Kirk was the first who brought this to international prominence, and certainly to prominence in New Zealand, Australia, the Pacific and South East Asia. In many ways he led the protest which was registered with France. I know he would be disappointed, were he still alive, to realise that there were nuclear tests so soon after his death. Fortunately it appears as though that program has now come to an end, and what a relief for the people in this region that it will end. Let us hope that it will never happen again. If it does not happen again, as it ought not to, a very great deal of credit for that must go to the late Norman Kirk. </para>
        <para>I met him but a few times. I found him easy to talk to. I found that he was interested not in making political points but in understanding what was in my mind about certain issues. He would express his view to me quite clearly without any idea of scoring any political points. He was, I think, in every sense of the word, a fine man. He had a fine career. People at my age, or perhaps even older, realise just what a young age it is for a man to die. </para>
        <para>It was a personal tragedy for him and a tragedy to the people of New Zealand that not only did he die at a young age but also that he died so soon after coming to office. He was in the full flight of office, so to speak. For his Party leaders who were left, I regret that this should have happened. But, as these things must happen, another man has been elected to lead the Labour Party in New Zealand. Government must go on. I have met but once <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rowling,</inline> the successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kirk.</inline> I wish him and his Party good fortune under his leadership. </para>
        <para>I wish to express the sympathy of the Liberal Party to the family of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kirk</inline> in the loss of their kinsman who had reached such stature, of whom they must have been proud and with whom they hoped for a long association in the years to come. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>Australians feel a very close kinship with the New Zealand people. On this occasion we too feel the effect of the tragic loss of New Zealand&#39;s relatively new Prime Minister who had made a very great impact in his own country and, indeed, in Australia. He was a man who won this respect by his sincerity and through the confidence that he was able to engender in people. I had the opportunity to meet him briefly on a number of occasions and I must say that I was impressed by the stature of the man. He was quiet. He was dignified. But he had an enormous grasp of a wide range of subjects. Whilst his educational opportunities might have been rather limited, he did have an intellectual capacity that could match that of the best of educated people. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think it is very sad when a nation is robbed of a leader particularly if that leader is in the prime of his life and at the point of his political career when he can do so much. Australia and New Zealand are two countries which do need to enjoy close relations and to understand each other. The Right Honourable Norman Kirk did add to this understanding and did help to strengthen the bond and relationship between New Zealand and Australia which I am sure will continue to grow under the new administration. The sympathy of the Country Party is extended to the New Zealand nation and to the Kirk family. </para>

Not only did I meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kirk</inline> on that occasion at that seminar but I also had the privilege of spending an hour with him on a later occasion in his office. My meeting with the late Prime Minister of New Zealand was an inspiring and stimulating occasion for me. Most vivid in my memory is his outline of his vision for his country. As. has already been said by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kirk</inline> had a special affection for the people of the Pacific Islands. He also had a special feeling for young people, for less privileged people and for the real quality of life of people, excluding things material. I repeat: It was a privilege. for me to meet him. I am glad to have this opportunity to associate myself with this motion of condolence. </para>

          <para>-I wish to speak briefly on this motion. In 1971 my wife and I went to New Zealand. Typical of the late Norman Kirk,-the New Zealand Prime Minister took a Sunday off to entertain us. Even though I was purely a backbencher, he showed us around his home city of Christchurch. I have never been more impressed in my life by an individual. He was a man who was highly cultured and yet, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, he had very little formal education, leaving school at the age of twelve, By occupation he was a train driver like the late Ben Chifley.

        <para>He was a man, as the Prime Minister also mentioned, who had great concern for people of all races, irrespective of colour, right throughout Asia.  His  wife- I mention this fact because our condolences go to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kirk-</inline> is a very lovely woman, who was completely dedicated to the work of her husband. She is a person of great humility. I am quite sure she was of very great assistance indeed to her husband in his work. I should like to express very sincere sympathy to her, to the nation of New Zealand, which has lost a very great leader, and, for that matter, to the whole of Asia, for this man understood the great problems of the region and was working towards overcoming, and was doing a great deal to overcome, those problems. </para>

He became  Clerk  at a young age and served for what may have been a &#39;record term. I had had the good fortune to have ar&#60; family association with him from 1928. He was one of the most vital, colourful people in Canberra in those early days. I am enduringly in his debt.-&#39; I went to school with his son; the first words I spoke in this House related to that son&#39;s untimely death. I have maintained contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Green</inline> throughout the years of their retirement in Tasmania. He was acknowledged in Tasmania as one of that State&#39;s outstanding citizens in this generation, one of its most effective interpreters of its past. In his service as  Clerk,  when he had to be anonymous, and in his long, years of retirement, when he was free to write, he was a great protagonist of the privileges of the Parliament and of the duties of parliamentarians, a very great servant of the Parliament and through it of the Australian people. All of us who were members of the House in his time will always remember him. </para>

          <para>-I should like to pay a very short tribute to the late Frank Green. He was a charming and scholarly man and a very distinguished servant of this Parliament, as the Prime Minister has quite rightly pointed out. He was also an outstanding citizen of Tasmania. In addition to all these great qualities he possessed a puckish sense of humour which we all appreciated enormously. I personally am very grateful to him for the many hours of conversation I had with him. His advice to me when I was first elected to this Parliament in 1969 was quite invaluable. He was very closely associated with the village where I now live- Richmond. He understood and, indeed, wrote about its great history and the tremendously important part it played in the development of Tasmania. He lived a very full and active life. He contributed greatly, in my view, to the scholarship of men. On behalf of my wife and myself I extend sincere sympathy to his wonderful widow, Florence. </para>

          <para>- I should like to pay a brief tribute to Frank Green. When I was first elected to this Parliament in 1945 he was a very kind and valued adviser to me, as a new member, about how to settle into the Parliament. I agree with the honourable member who spoke of his sense of humour. I remember that sometimes he used to depart from this place saying that he was going to look up  His  Holiness &#39;s telephone number, which meant Vat 69, or was going to pay his respects to the British Royal Family, which meant King George IV. He always had those pleasant touches in his conversations with you.  His  wit in giving advice on political affairs was one of the ways in which it was made palatable. I very greatly valued his professional work as a  Clerk  of this House. He was a very distinguished  Clerk.  He will be remembered for his tremendous knowledge of the past of this House and for his kindness to all people. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable member would not mind allowing me to continue I would thank him very much. I have read the Hansard record and there is no mention of shouting, nor do you draw attention to the pandemonium or say that the honourable member ought to stop shouting. The point I make is that there is no way in the world that anybody reading the Hansard record could assume that the position you put is accurate. Therefore I think the honourable member for Mackellar ought to be given some chance to explain. </para>

              <para>- I rise to speak on the point of order. When on 23 August the honourable member for Mackellar rose to his feet after you had said: &#39;The question is that the House do now adjourn&#39; and before that question was put, you were still in command of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and any disorderly conduct on the part of the honourable member for Mackellar should have been dealt with at that time. The House had not at that point of time adjourned. The House was still in session. The powers of the  Speaker  were still there to be used. The fact that you failed to use them does not justify your action on this occasion. </para>

              <para>- I do not think the honourable gentleman was in the House at the time. Any honourable member who was in the House would know that the honourable member for Mackellar showed a disrespect for the Chair. He even denied me the opportunity of announcing the next day of sitting or the hour at which the House would meet. He was shouting at the top of his voice. I asked him on several occasions- on 3 occasions to be exact- to resume his seat and he would not do so. I call upon him for the final time to apologise. If he does apologise to the Chair the matter will finish there. </para>

              <para>- I would like to remind the honourable member for Gippsland that the  Speaker  is in charge of the House until such time as he leaves the chair. Honourable members might recall that my predecessor was very strict about ensuring when the adjournment took place each night that no honourable member left his place until such time as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> had left the chair. He was very strict about that and the honourable member would know that. While the  Speaker  occupies the chair he has full authority in the House. Until such time as I leave the chair I have full authority over the proceedings of the House. </para>

If you had a dispute or an altercation with the honourable member for Mackellar as you state there were only 3 exchanges from that point on- you should have taken action at that time. I believe it is quite improper that a member can have hanging over his head a charge that may be laid by a  Speaker  months and months after the event in question has occurred. The facts show that you put the question for the adjournment of the House and you said: &#39;The ayes have it&#39;.

              <para>- Let us be precise about it. You stood up to make some announcement. In my view, if you were disturbed about the performance of the honourable member for Mackellar you should have named him and called for a division and had him suspended from the service of the House at that time. You did not do so. I do not believe it is proper for you now, five or six weeks later, just because you now have the numbers, to suspend him. The simple truth is that on that day you were not sure you had the numbers because everybody had cleared off. </para>

          <para>We all remember the circumstances of that particular sitting. The Minister for Transport had caused a dispute with the airline pilots and they had gone out on strike and refused to carry the Labor politicians. As a result of that, VIP aircraft were called into service, honourable members opposite were busy hurrying and scurrying to get on to the VIP aircraft to get home, and you were not sure that you could suspend the honourable member for Mackellar from the service of this House. I submit that it is quite improper that a charge of this nature can be levied five or six weeks after the event. </para>

The matters that the honourable member for Gippsland is now raising relate to a period of time that has elapsed and have nothing to do with any point on which you have ruled. Therefore, he should speak only about the matter from which he dissents. The motion moved by the honourable member for Gippsland relates to dissent from your ruling.

I submit on the first count that the charge you lay against him is not worthy when compared with precedents established in relation to disturbances in this House. I recall to your mind the day when the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> stood in this place and refused to accede to the Speaker&#39;s wish.

              <para>-Order! The point is quite clear. The matter before the Chair is a motion of dissent from the ruling of the Chair in relation to the honourable member for Mackellar. The matter that the honourable member for Gippsland refers to and which occurred in the past was not condoned or encouraged by me; so he should not regard it as a precedent for a ruling I have given in this case. It is for the Chair to decide what is right and proper. I thought I had done the right thing in letting it go until this time, because the honourable member denied me the opportunity of saying anything at all. If the honourable member had been in the Chair- I leave it to the sense of fairness of any member who was in the House at the time- he would have taken exactly the course that I took. </para>

              <para>- A turtle farmer speaks; that is about how much he knows about it. He does not even know to what point of order he is addressing himself. All he is doing is wasting the time of this House. I believe that we are faced with a precedent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I would like to know on what precedent you have based this action because I think that it is important that we have this information. What you are doing today is laying down a ground rule that when any member misbehaves, even though the  Speaker  may not take action at the time he can on reflection or after a certain amount of publicity has been given to the event, perhaps a few months later proceed to take action against the member concerned. I submit that you were derelict in your duty on 23 August. If you thought that the honourable member for Mackellar should be suspended from the service of the House you should have taken action at that time. It is quite improper that any  Speaker  should come into this Parliament five or six weeks later, or whatever the period is, and then so move. It is for that reason that I have moved dissent from your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir.</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I repeat the point that I have made because each member of this Parliament will be affected by it. The ruling which you have given means that any  Speaker  can ignore something if it so suits him by leaving the chair. He can then come into the House the next day, the next week, the next month or even 6 months later, and at an appropriate time, perhaps when a member is about to speak on a vital and important matter, take action that results in the suspension of that member from the service of the House. I believe that the action you have taken is a dereliction of your duty as  Speaker.  Whilst I have not always been in your best graces as a member of this House I respect the forms of the House and the Chair for the job which it must do. I will fight and support you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, when</inline> you have a job to do. But I will not support a resolution of this nature which gives you the power to remove a member from this House perhaps months after the event has occurred. This is exactly what the precedent lays down. If you wanted to remove the honourable member for Mackellar on 23 August it was your bounden duty to do so at that time and not to come back to this House 5 weeks later and do it then. It is for that reason that I have moved against your ruling. </para>

I pointed out to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that what is in dispute here is whether you have the right to demand an apology from a member after the one day sitting that was held in this House on 23 August when certain events took place at the conclusion of the proceedings. Some of those events are set out on pages 1 1 67 and 1168 of Hansard. Other events took place afterwards and are not recorded.

The matter at present under debate was resolved by a resolution which was carried by this House some half an hour ago. The only question which can be subjected to your ruling is whether you are in fact in charge of this House until you leave the chair. I suggest that honourable members ought to be justifying a dissent motion on the basis that you are not in charge of the House while you are hi the chair, because that is what they are saying. </para>

We are protesting about your conduct, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and I think it is right to refer to the protests that have been made to earlier rulings. I make the point that we are opposing your ruling today because of the context in which it falls in your conduct of the House. I remind the House that the Government, which has undoubted rights and obligations to govern, nevertheless through its election of a  Speaker  and the conduct of affairs here has the obligation to allow Opposition members to speak and to ensure that rulings are fair and that the House is equitably run. The honourable member for Mackellar did his best all through that day to raise serious matters. You will be aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that the Government has since appointed a royal commission to deal with one of those matters. The honourable member was prevented from speaking, so naturally he became upset towards the end of that day. </para>

              <para>- I have only a limited time, as honourable members know. These interventions and points of order are very interesting, but I should like to make one or two points. I point out that the matter before the House is your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> on the request for an apology. I point out too that there were some mitigating circumstances. I refer you to an item on page 1 167 of Hansard. At one stage the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> moved that the question be now put. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, you</inline> said: </para>

              <para>-I am trying to be fair as I was with the honourable member for Mackellar previously. The honourable member had come to see me earlier and said that he would like to make a personal explanation because of something that had been said by an announcer on the radio. I did not tell the Leader of the House that a personal explanation was to be made and he moved the adjournment. In fairness to the honourable member for Mackellar I appealed to the Leader of the House that there was a personal explanation to be made. I intended to call the honourable member for Mackellar to do so before the adjournment of the House was moved. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr GARLAND</inline>T agree with that and I accept that that was the position exactly. I was in the House and I was aware of that situation. I was saying, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that this discussion is about whether the procedures of this House are being correctly carried out in relation to the ruling that was made. I am pointing out the mitigating circumstance which applies to the honourable member for Mackellar. Having declined to take that motion, which was the gag, several minutes of debate or cut and thrust took place and then you said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That motion had been declined. The honourable member for Mackellar intervened on other matters, and then later you said: </para>

            <para>Order! I have not put the question. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The question is that the House do now adjourn. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The relevance of these extracts is that it shows that the situation was a highly confused one. The honourable member for Mackellar, believing that he had the right and duty to raise the 2 matters to which I have alluded already, did so. You left the chair. </para>
          <para>Our major point is that, if you wished to take action against the honourable member for Mackellar in the way in which you have this afternoon, it should have been done on that occasion and at no other time. You have said yourself that you were in charge of the House. You were in the chair. You were responsible for the conduct of the House. That is not in dispute. What is in dispute is your action this afternoon in raising the matter in these confused circumstances. I point out that you asked the honourable member for Mackellar to apologise for what happened when he was endeavouring to raise those matters. Naturally he felt very deeply about them particularly as he had in his hand at the time documents which indicated some corruption in the community. The Government has appointed a royal commission to look into one of those matters. It cannot be said to be a matter of no substance. In those circumstances, for you, in the name of the House, to ask the honourable member, as you did this afternoon, to apologise to you, is we believe incorrect. I suggest to you that it is not right and it is not fair. </para>
          <para>I conclude on the point that the essence of democracy is divided power and the essence of parliamentary proceedings in this House is fairness. Democracy includes the opportunity for minorities to have their voices heard. The Opposition has the right to be reasonably heard and to have standing orders upheld. This right is being stifled by your decision this afternoon and by your conduct on previous occasions. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>in the absence of the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> who has been called away on a matter of personal urgency, I say on behalf of the Government that we oppose the motion. The position is made quite clear by reference to page 1 163 of Hansard where you will see that the motion for the adjournment of the House was carried by 56 votes to 45 votes. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> were prevented from announcing the date for the resumption of the Parliament. The matter is as simple as that. The conduct of the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> prevented you fronmaking a formal announcement as to when the, House would next sit. It was that conduct that was irregular and prevented the  Speaker  from carrying out his normal duties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Accordingly, I say that today a great deal of time has been wasted on an issue that could have been dealt with outside this Parliament. There are many important issues to be debated here. One would have thought that honourable members opposite would have been considering matters that affect their electorates and may have been anxious to pursue the business of the Parliament and not try to continue to support the sort of conduct that brings this Parliament into disrepute. While ever honourable members opposite seek to associate , themselves with conduct of that type they will lower the dignity of this Parliament. A lot of time has been wasted today. All that was asked for was an apology which any reasonable person would have expected to obtain. That apology was refused again today. We say no more about it. I move: </para>

He said that the motion for the adjournment was put and was carried by so many votes to so many other votes. The Hansard record, a copy of which I have in my hand, shows clearly at page 1 167 that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> said: &#39;I move: &#34;That the question be now put.&#34; &#39; You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> as I think you said during the course of the debate, said: &#39;I promised to deal with a personal explanation pertaining to matters outside this House&#39;. The honourable member for Mackellar then rose, in pursuance of that arrangement with you, and dealt with that matter. There is no question that the statement made in this House by the Special Minister of State was completely and entirely wrong, and since it will appear in Hansard I believe I should make this explanation. </para>

            <para>- Does the Prime Minister recall saying in his 1972 election policy speech that a Labor Government&#39;s first help for regional development would be to implement the Victorian decentralisation committee&#39;s recommendation that &#39;centres nominated for accelerated development be recognised for telephone charging purposes as extensions of the metropolitan area whereby rentals would be equated and calls between these places and the capital charged as for local calls&#39;? Did he go on to say that &#39;in our first term of office, a Federal Labor Government will concentrate its own initiatives and endeavours on two areas- Albury-Wodonga and Townsville&#39;? Is it a fact that Albury-Wodonga residents, in common with all Australians, have not only not had a decrease in telephone charges since his Government came to office but have had savage increases imposed with more promised? I ask the Prime Minister whether he ever intended to implement this promise, or was it just an election gimmick? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman accurately quoted from my policy speech for the election held on 2 December 1972. One of the early actions by my Government was to set up a royal commission  under  the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Vernon to inquire into the Post Office in general. One of the matters referred to the commission concerned those proposals for reduced telephone and telex charges in regional centres which had been recommended by the Victorian Decentralisation Committee in Victoria. The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Vernon&#39;s royal commission was promptly tabled. It is being considered by the Government. Complementary action may be required by the Victorian government. The general theme is that if there are to be concessions in regional areas they should not be borne by subscribers to the telecommunications services alone but by the taxpayers overall. The Government has promptly- it could not have more promptly- promoted the development of Albury-Wodonga. The Government was elected on 2 December. My colleague, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, and the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria met in Albury-Wodonga on 25 January 1973. The basic legislation has now been passed by the 3 Parliaments. There is in Kings Hall at the moment an exhibition which I commend to honourable gentlemen concerning the progress of Albury-Wodonga. Similar progress has not been possible in Townsville because of the intransigence of the Queensland Government. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Northern Development, refers to fuel supplies for north Queensland. I believe that the &#39;W. H. Leonard&#39; will not arrive in Cairns until 29th of this month and that it will contain only a small portion of distillate for Cairns and district. Are there any other vessels due in Cairns before or after this date? Industry in the area of Leichhardt is short of fuel, particularly distillate, to enable it to keep operating until the twenty-ninth. I refer to local authorities and the tobacco, timber, fishing and sugar industries. Can the Minister advise me and the people in the area what relief can be expected in the immediate future and what steps have been taken? I know that the Minister has been vitally concerned in this matter. </para>

              <para>- The question happens to be asked about north Queensland. If it had not been for the supply of 150,000 gallons of distillate from the naval stores in Cairns the entire sugar industry would have had to close down in the area north of Townsville. Due to the cooperation of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Science who was Acting Minister for Defence at the time this amount of distillate was made available. It is a fact that the initial problem was caused by industrial troubles in Brisbane. This has shown that there are very serious inherent problems in regard to the supply of fuel to central and northern Queensland which should be looked at very quickly by State and Federal authorities as well as by industry. These authorities should look at the capacity of the Ampol and Amoco refineries in Brisbane, the capacity of the Queensland Railways, the capacity of only one ship, the &#39;W. H. Leonard&#39;, to supply the whole of north Queensland, and also the problem of not having sufficient storage facilities in north Queensland. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This same problem was experienced during the floods and it is experienced following cyclones. Here again the complete vulnerability of north Queensland has been demonstrated. Next Monday a ship called the &#39;Texaco Bogota&#39; will call into Townsville with 15,000 tons of distillate. On the following day the &#39;W. H. Leonard&#39; is scheduled to discharge approximately 3,100 tons at Townsville. On Thursday week the &#39;W. H. Leonard&#39; is due to discharge something like 4, 100 tons in Cairns. The position is tight; there is no question about that. The oil companies and the industries concerned are looking at a system of rationalisation which could mean the rearrangement of fuel supply for the Cairns district when the &#39;Texaco Bogota&#39; discharges its cargo next Monday. I can assure the honourable member that the matter is well in hand. I stress that the present problems are due to 23 years of the Opposition&#39;s refusal when in government to provide ships to serve north Queensland and its refusal to put pressure on the Queensland Government to allow the refineries in Queensland to have a greater capacity. </para>

            <para>-The Prime Minister will know that industrial action over recent weeks and months has caused serious disruption of fuel supplies. I ask the Prime Minister whether he knows that the serious dislocation of fuel supplies still exists with the storage and distribution system now virtually exhausted. Will the Prime Minister do all he can to rectify the present position and will he consider two suggestions which might lessen the chances of such disruption occurring in the future? Firstly, will he immediately set up a committee of Ministers, comprised of such people as the Ministers for Minerals and Energy, Transport and Defence, to consult the oil industry, the unions and State authorities with a view to building some safeguards into the storage and distribution system? Secondly, will he ask the royal commission which is at present inquiring into the petroleum industry whether it will look into the matter of fuel distribution with a view to recommending measures which might reduce the prospects of similar disruption in the future? </para>

My colleagues will give him detailed replies to his questions. My colleague, the Minister for Northern Development, has touched on one of the particular difficulties there have been in the distribution of fuel supplies in Queensland. There are 2 factors. There is not sufficient production capacity in Queensland and there is an inadequate distribution system there. Ever since I became Prime Minister, I have been in correspondence with the Premier of Queensland, urging him to allow Australian Government ships to trade between ports in that State. It is a fantastic situation that there is one refinery in Queensland and one oil tanker alone which is allowed to operate. </para>

Yesterday afternoon and again this morning I met with some honourable members and honourable senators from Tasmania and I will be seeing them again on either Wednesday or Thursday this week. There are problems associated with the increase. Let us face the facts of life. The facts of life are that the Australian National Line has incurred substantially increased costs in its operations both in the form of labour costs - </para>

              <para>-If the honourable member wants a few facts on the matter, then I can easily give them to him. Some of the increased costs were incurred at a time when the honourable member was a member of the former Government. For example, in July 1972 the salary bill of officers of the Third Division of the Australian Public Service increased by $46,000. 1 could go on for some time elaborating on the increases that were incurred when the present Opposition was the Government in this country, but I do not want to weary honourable members. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>When we were in Opposition we did not object to increases in the charges levied by ANL because we realise that its increased costs have to be passed on. In 1972-73, when the honourable member for Gippsland was partly responsible, as I was, ANL incurred a loss of $ 1.65m on its general cargo operations. It is estimated that a loss of $3. 8m will be incurred in the year 1973-74. Unless ANL&#39;s freight rates are adjusted, the loss for 1974-75 will be about $7.4m. No honourable member can justify increased losses of this type. It is reasonable that the user should pay for the cost of the service provided. Consider what ANL&#39;s competitors in the Tasmanian trade have done. The Union Steam Ship Co. in recent months has increased its freight rates on the Melbourne-Sydney run by 27.68 per cent and on the Sydney-Hobart run by 25.5 per cent while Associated Steamships Pty Ltd increased its charges by 33.3 per cent. So ANL&#39;s increase of 25 per cent is quite reasonable and quite moderate. Protests are being made at the moment about the increase, but there were no similar protests when ANL&#39;s competitors increased their freight rates. </para>
          <para>The honourable member asked me why we did not wait until the Jimmy Committee&#39;s report was tabled. I do not know when the </para>
          <para class="block">Jimmy Committee will present its report, but I can give the honourable member one small piece of information: When the Tasmanian ports committee recently decided to increase port charges, it was suggested to the committee that it might await the Jimmy Committee report and its findings. It refused to do so. I believe that indirectly port charges are the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government so there is one law for the Tasmanians and one law for the Australian Government. The Tasmanian Government is protesting very strongly about our decision to increase ANL&#39;s freight rates by 25 per cent, but at the same time it has increased its own rail rates by between 25 per cent and 33 per cent. The road hauliers have increased their charges by an even greater amount. Others have had to increase charges. </para>
          <para>We do not claim to have any great power to avoid the increases we have made. They were necessary and we put them through. What do they represent as individual charges? It is important that I pass this information on to honourable members. ANL has already noted examples of freight forwarders increasing the total freight charge by 25 per cent. In other words, they have been trying to pass on to consumers in Tasmania more than they should. I strongly advise manufacturers and others in Tasmania to examine the freight rate charges which are being levied against them. After all, the sea leg element of the cost represents only 40-45 per cent of the total. We have already noted numerous examples of freight forwarders in Tasmania increasing their total charge to the manufacturer by 25 per cent. The increase in ANL&#39;s charges represents an increase of $2.40 to $2.80 per ton. Whilst the freight rate is much greater, it includes wharfage and land-based freight forwarders&#39; charges. The sea leg represents about 40 per cent of the freight rate. </para>

It has not completely convinced me. Nevertheless, up to this stage I have adhered to the advice which it gave to my predecessors. </para>

              <para>- Professor Swan expressed a written opinion in the &#39;Australian&#39; newspaper last week that it would have been 10 per cent greater now if those steps had not been taken. However, I am concerned at the fact that evidence has been accumulated over the last two or three months of very excessive retail profit margins. It is true that in some cases they have been as high as 300 per cent. Many of between 140 per cent and 250 per cent have been proved to my satisfaction. It is commonly known, of course, that retail profit margins vary a great deal and that where the average is 50 per cent or 60 per cent there can sometimes be a deviation to as much as 300 per cent. That has been a very common practice over a long period of time. However, the matter is so serious and in some ways the margins have been so great that the Government considers that it is justified in attempting to see whether an effective system of price regulation may be based on the constitutional powers that the Government has in relation to imports. The matter has been under examination for some time. I had hoped that retailers would respond by fixing more reasonable margins. So far we have had no evidence of their doing so. Provided the system that I have just indicated briefly is a workable one, the Government will seriously consider its introduction. </para>

            <para>-I recollect that some time about 1970-71 when the right honourable gentleman was a member of a former Government an inquiry was set up to examine freight rates to and from Tasmania and a number of other things. An increase that had just been put through then probably had as much effect on the Tasmanian economy as the present increase in freight rates will have. That inquiry, which was instituted by the Liberal and Country Party Government of that time, found that the freight rate increase was fully justified. </para>

              <para>-Honourable members opposite botched it up and we have been spending time ever since fixing up what they botched up. The shortage of ships and the use of unsuitable types of ships is one of the real reasons why Tasmanian freight rates are in the position in which they are at present. We are adjusting the situation now by ordering and buying new ships to meet the requirements of the Tasmanian trade. Honourable members opposite did nothing about the situation other than increase freight rates. </para>

              <para>-Honourable members opposite increased freight rates and they know it They set up an inquiry which disclosed that their actions were fully justified. They loaded the membership of the inquiry so that it would come up with that decision. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister has said that he will take steps to examine the freight rate differential and the problems associated with it. The Jimmy Committee has been appointed to investigate the matter and come up with recommendations to the Government as to what form of assistance should be given. It will not be like the assistance that was handed out by the Australian Country Party to the cockies of this country. It pulled ideas out of its head without giving real consideration to what effects their implementation were going to have. All we are trying to do is to make sure that the assistance that is given is in the interests of Tasmania. So it will be fully researched. </para>
          <para>Let us deal with the facts. Unless an adjustment is made the loss on the Tasmania-mainland run this year will be $3.8m made up of a loss of $2. 85m on the Tasmania-Melbourne section and $0.95m on the Tasmania-Sydney section. The Government believes that it is unfortunate but nevertheless unavoidable that these increases have to be introduced. It is just a fact of life that increases will have to be introduced unless we are prepared to subsidise the service, which we are not prepared to do at this stage, even though we are providing a subsidy of $lm a year for the &#39;Empress of Australia&#39;, which is something that the former Liberal-Country Party Government was not prepared to do. That $lm subsidy is being provided in an endeavour to ensure that the &#39;Empress of Australia&#39; is retained on the service. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Education. I refer to the tertiary allowances scheme and in particular to the bricklaying course which is being run at Randwick Technical College. By way of preamble I state that on 30 July 1974 one of my constituents was advised that die course was an approved course under the tertiary allowances scheme but that so far he has not received one zac in payment. My question is: In view of the fact that it is within my knowledge that a decision as to whether it will be paid and when it will be paid is yet to be made by the Department of Education&#39;s head office in Canberra, will the Minister do something to get the Department off its backside and release the decision? </para>

            <para>- I would be surprised if a decision on an individual case were being determined in Canberra. When applications are made for tertiary allowances they are usually made in the State office. I am not going to accept automatically that the officers are at fault and that everything was perfect with the application or that the entitlement is not in dispute. There has been an enormous increase in the number of individuals receiving tertiary grants. When there was an increase this year the officers of my Department in the States and elsewhere were working overtime 3 nights a week and also all Saturday processing the applications. I will not say that the officers concerned are infallible and that all the decisions have been perfect. Sometimes appeals come through to me and sometimes the decisions are reversed. </para>

The fact that this was done is an earnest of our intention to co-ordinate our legislative activities with those of the States to ensure that advertising is not misleading and is in the interests of the consumer of therapeutic goods. I hope that the States will honour the undertakings they gave on that occasion and will move rapidly to implement the recommendations upon which we achieved this consensus. But, of course, if there are unforeseen delays we would not feel bound to wait for the initiatives of the States as some of our predecessors did. </para>

            <para>-As is well known, there is and has been for some little time a worldwide shortage of paper. Resulting from that, consideration has been given from a number of sources to the supply of alternative raw materials for the manufacture of paper. Kenaf is one such material that has been studied and considered. I understand it is a tropical plant of the hibiscus family with woody stalks ranging from 6 feet to 12 feet in height and one inch to 2 inches in diameter. It is grown in some Asian countries as a substitute fibre for jute. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It has been claimed that it has the great advantage of being ready for harvesting and conversion into pulp after a growing period of only 120 days, which compares with about 20 years for the growing of timber. Limited laboratory scale tests have shown that paper can be successfully produced from kenaf but because it has not yet been grown in commercial quantities full scale commercial and industrial testing is not yet complete. My Department has some additional information and I shall make it available to the honourable member. </para>

            <para>-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I apologise for this question on the eve of his very important function tonight. Is the  Chairman  of the Union Bank of Switzerland, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Alfred</inline> Schaefer,  known to the Treasurer or in the Treasury? Was Australia invited to the recent financial conference in London? Does the Treasurer know of reasons for a statement that there are mounting signs of a coming global financial and monetary crisis which could wreck the economy of the world? If he regards the statement as valid, does it include the socialist world? </para>

            <para>-To the best of my knowledge I am not aware of the gentleman mentioned. I have heard of the Bank, which is a well known institution in Switzerland. The honourable gentleman, of course, is not alone in forecasting doom for the future of Western economies. Personally, I have a lot more faith in the ability of democratic governments to survive those forebodings and I hope that with a little co-operation and understanding of the basic problems those events will not overwhelm the Western world. It will be very sad for the Western world if they do. It will mean the end of the kinds of mechanisms of government that we have and on which we pride ourselves as being the best in the world. </para>

            <para>-I ask a question of the Treasurer. Is it not a fact that when the Australian Development Bank was established the interest rate was fixed at 6 per cent? Is it not a fact that though hundreds of farmers and industrialists signed Development Bank loan contracts at an interest rate of 6 per cent those people are today being forced to pay 1 1 per cent? Why are these borrowers, whose loans were signed, sealed and confirmed prior to the interest rate increases, required now to pay the increase? Is not 1 1 per cent a completely unreal and uneconomic rate to pay for purely developmental loans? Will the Treasurer review the interest rate for Development Bank loans negotiated and fixed years before the recent increases in the rate which is now 1 1 per cent? </para>

            <para>- It is an unfortunate circumstance that in order that money can be loaned to B it first has to be obtained somewhere else from A. In the face of continuing inflation nobody is disposed at the moment to accept low rates on money deposited with institutions. This is one of the hard facts of life, unfortunately. It does not apply only in Australia; it applies in all the countries that the previous questioner asked me about. If contracts were written firm with a particular interest rate they ought not to be varied but I think that probably, as is so often the case, borrowers do not always read the fine points of the relevant documents. Most len dings from banks contain provisions for the rate to be varied as the bank itself has to pay higher interest on its deposits. &#39;. <inline font-style="italic">1t</inline></para>

          <para>I am hopeful as are others, that gradually interest rates will come down rather than go up. But they will not come down in the face of continuing inflation. Whilst a lot of hard words are spoken about .inflation and there are a lot of attempts to suggest that if Opposition members were in government instead of us it would not exist, I point out again that the governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, some of which vary in political complexion from this one, have the same sort of economic problem. </para>

          <para>-I should like to inform honourable members that all Hans ards from this day are being produced by the computer typesetting system at the Government Printing Office. The initial preparation of the material for the system .entails more time than it did under the previous hot metal process, although the overall time for printing is much less. Because of this preparation requirement, tables of figures and non-read material which are incorporated in Hansard can cause production bottlenecks. It would assist greatly if Ministers and members who propose to incorporate tables or documents in their speeches will supply them well in advance, and certainly before the dinner break to the Reporting Department for prompt dispatch to the Printer. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I remind honourable members that inclusion in Hansard of unread matter by leave of the House is subject to the authority of the Presiding Officer. If the Government Printer advises that the incorporation of material will present technical problems, will be costly or will unduly delay the publication of the daily Hansard, the Presiding Officer may direct that the matter be not included. Leave given to an honourable member to incorporate certain material in his speech is subject to that qualification. </para>

            <para>- Australia is living on the edge of a precipice as far as fuel is concerned. It is an indictment of the Government, which claims to have such close links with the unions, that the Australian community has been brought to such a state of disruption by the actions of militant unions. Australia today is 70 per cent self-sufficient in petroleum, yet the Australian motorist too often finds his service station closed, with a sign outside reading: &#39;Sorry, no petrol&#39;. Not only is the motorist&#39;s tank empty, but also on-farm supplies are empty, the service station tanks are empty, the oil companies&#39; district depots are empty and the bulk storages are empty. In fact, the whole storage and distribution system is virtually empty. The trouble is that, even if full production can be maintained, and the distribution system works properly, it will be a considerable time before the situation can be brought back to normal. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is little doubt that there is a definite policy being followed to keep Australia&#39;s fuel reserves at the barest minimum. The objective of this policy is to ensure that when there is industrial action in the oil industry- as happens with great frequency- there is an immediate impact, an immediate bite, so that the pressure on the community is felt quickly. I may be wrong. I hope I am. But I do not think I am. It&#39;s very hard to escape the conclusion that the stranglehold of unions on fuel supplies is seen as providing a very good starting point for a national offensive which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mundey,</inline> the  President  of the Communist Party of Australia has promised. </para>
          <para>There were reports recently that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> had told the Government that Australia had only one week&#39;s supply of fuel, including defence stocks. This is a scandalous and dangerous situation. I have heard of other estimates which put our distillate reserves at as little as 2 days&#39; supply. This is an intolerable situation. Of course, for many people, there is no fuel at all. It is not a question of a week&#39;s supply or 2 days&#39; supply for them- they simply have not been able to get fuel at all. This fuel shortage, the industrial action that has caused it, and other similar industrial actions, are major factors in a very serious amount of unrest that is growing throughout country areas of Australia. </para>
          <para>In my own electorate of Richmond, for example, service stations in Lismore and Ballina have recently been closed for long periods. The ordinary activities and commercial life of the community have been disrupted. The sugar cane harvest has been threatened. Fishing fleets have been tied up in the ports. Sawmills have stopped. Transport services have been halted. Mail services have been disrupted because train services have been cut. Not only have local people been immobilised by fuel shortages, but so too have tourists, many of whom were stranded for days on the far north coast of New South Wales simply because there was no petrol. </para>
          <para>In the electorate of Gwydir, for example, the wheat harvest has been threatened, and the preparation of the cotton crop- which must be planted by the first week in October at the latest -is being hindered very seriously. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The cotton industry could be wiped out if it cannot get fuel urgently. There has been concern for weeks in the sugar areas of Queensland about the supply of fuel for the sugar cane harvest. There is only a week&#39;s supply of fuel in some cases and down to a day in others. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> apparently prevailed on the Government to release some fuel from our defence stocks for some areas, but the problem remains. But what is he doing to get at the root of the problem- the disruptive tactics of some trade unions? A tanker arrived in Mackay on Sunday with sufficient fuel for the district for about 3 weeks at the most, and it will be 3 weeks or a month before the next tanker load arrives. </para>
          <para>The potato and onion crops in the Lockyer area are in trouble, school buses in many regions have been unable to run- and so the story of inconvenience and disruption continues. People living in Canberra and in many other places across Australia know only too well how hard it is to get heating oil or gas. In all this, despite repeated urgent appeals to the Government for help in cases where there has been a desperate need for petrol, distillate, oil or gas, there has been virtually no response whatsoever from the Government. There has been not even a slightest sign of interest or concern, let alone any effort by the Government to try to help. But this goes much further than disruption of agriculture and other industry and the disruption of the normal daily life of the community. </para>
          <para>We now have the shocking situation in which our defence forces are virtually immobilised. Newspapers are publishing articles with headlines such as: &#39;Please, no invasion today&#39;. The attitude of this Government to the defence of Australia is well known, but the position becomes quite unacceptable when the small amount of defence capacity we do have is sabotaged by lack of fuel. At the moment the Navy is crippled, the Air Force is virtually grounded and the Army is hardly able to move at all because of the critical shortage of fuel. Apparently only one naval vessel- &#39;Vendetta&#39;- is operational, with the rest of the Navy tied up in port. Even our coastal patrol boats are operating on a restricted basis. We have had Fl 1 Is and Mirages in Darwin that could not return to their home bases because there was no fuel there for them when they got there. Maritime patrolling by the Air Force is also restricted. The Army has had to cancel a big exercise because there is no fuel to move the troops. </para>
          <para>Why are we in this extraordinary situation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker?</inline> Why is a country which is so self sufficient in petroleum- self-sufficient for the moment, let me emphasise- so hamstrung by a shortage of fuel? The answer is that continuing industrial action has rendered the whole production, storage and distribution system incapable of meeting our needs. The system normally can cope with the nation&#39;s fuel needs, but it just cannot cope with today&#39;s abnormal needs. It is not fair for the Government to try to blame the distribution system. The blame lies with the series of strikes, the union limitations and bans within the industry. </para>
          <para>I shall give a quick run-down on the industrial actions that have caused the present crisis. Back in February 5,000 oil industry clerks stopped fuel deliveries. In March the oil tanker drivers in Sydney went on strike. In April drivers, storemen and packers went on strike. There were rolling strikes at the Australian Oil Refinery plant in Sydney. The Ampol and Amoco refineries in Brisbane were closed because the Australian Workers Union put a ban on deliveries of fuel from those refineries. In July ships&#39; engineers were on strike, and at one stage 53 oil tankers were tied up. </para>

              <para>-Fifty-three. Crude oil from Bass Strait was not being carried to the refineries. In August 8 unions were involved in industrial action in the oil industry in support of a $50 a week pay rise. The AWU in Victoria cut the flow of Bass Strait crude to a trickle. There was an overtime ban at the Banksmeadow terminal in Sydney, 3 Victorian oil refineries were closed, the Amoco refinery in Brisbane was closed and no crude was being delivered to the refineries. Then the Transport Workers Union called a national strike, and the fuel shortage was described as the worst since World War II. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>Late in August the Australian Metal Workers Union applied bans in refineries and the Union&#39;s secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Halfpenny,</inline> said that this would eventually stop all fuel production. The AWU in Brisbane refused to load road tankers, except those bound for Ampol service stations. In the middle of August a tanker called the &#39;W.M. Leonard&#39; was loaded with fuel in Brisbane for north Queensland, but the AWU refused to disconnect the oil hose and the tanker could not move. The same thing happened with a tanker that was due to sail for another load of Bass Strait crude. The Amu put a black ban on some machinery at the Amoco refinery in Brisbane and stopped production. Late in August 3,000 oil tanker drivers and aircraft resellers went on strike. On 25 August the Transport Workers Union applied an overtime ban on tanker drivers operating out of Brisbane. This became a major factor in the serious situation that developed in northern New South Wales. On 29 August another ban on supplies was imposed on the Amoco refinery in Brisbane. I have outlined briefly some of the industrial troubles that have plagued the oil industry this year and caused the crisis that now exists. </para>
          <para>What are we going to do about all this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker?</inline> What is the Government going to do? I do not want to put all the blame on the Government for the present situation, because I know how difficult it is to deal with the industrial action of some of these unions. But I wonder just how long we must accept this continuing disruption of the life of the community. The &#39; Government appears to be quite helpless in the face of this problem, and of course this is not surprising in a world in which the power of the trade unions exceeds the power of elected governments, particularly this Government that we have at the moment. But there are some steps which the Government can and should take. Today at question time I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to appoint immediately a committee of Ministers to consult with the oil industry, the unions and State authorities with a view to trying to build some safeguards in the storage and distribution system. He ignored the question. There was no satisfactory reply. </para>
          <para>It is beyond dispute that the basic cause of the present crisis is the industrial action of the oil industry unions. The government claims to have a special relationship with the unions. I hope the Government will make use of that relationship to try to persuade the unions of the urgent need to take greater account of the needs of the nation. I wonder whether the strikes would have occurred, and the various kinds of limitations and bans that have been imposed would have occurred, or occurred to such an extent, if the rank and file members of the unions had had a say. Very serious considerations ought to be given to the introduction of compulsory secret voting in union affairs. This should certainly be the case in the strategic industries, such as fuel, power and transport. The  President  of the Communist Party of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mundey,</inline> says the call for secret ballots is part of the current popular game of union-bashing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I do not want to bash the unions. I want to see that unionists can express their views and not be bashed for doing so. I want to remove some of the power which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mundey</inline> and others like him have to bash the Australian community. </para>
          <para>I think the Government ought to consider the possibility of establishing some kind of fuel stockpile. If the kind of disruption we are now suffering is to be the normal order of things- and there seems little prospect that it will not be- we have to find ways to protect the community. Sweden has fuel stockpiles owned and managed by the Government for emergency use. Of course there would be major problems in this concept, but at least we have to look at it. Our defence forces clearly ought to have bigger fuel reserves. I know that fuel cannot be stored indefinitely, that there must be some turnover. This means that there would need to be co-ordination of arrangements between defence forces and other users of fuel. The storage system would need to be properly integrated with the total needs of the nation. </para>
          <para>A further suggestion I make is that the Government ask the current Royal Commission on Petroleum to examine and report on the causes and effects of fuel shortages and to recommend measures which might reduce the incidence of such shortages. I think everyone will agree, and I am sure the Government will accept, that we just cannot have this continuing interference with the flow of fuel to the community and to our defence forces. No country can tolerate this sabotage of its activities. I hope the Government will take this matter very seriously and that it will regard the fuel industry as a vital strategic industry. It might even be necessary, because of this industry&#39;s importance, for it to be recognised in special legislation that will protect the community in times of emergency such as exists at the moment. </para>
          <para>We cannot afford to run away from the problem. This is a serious problem affecting every section of the community. The nation is at the mercy of a few militant unions largely being led by communists who have this nation almost throttled because of their control of these strategic industries. I desperately plead for the Government to take some immediate action to relieve the hardship and disruption which has been caused to so many people across the nation. </para>

I listened with a great deal of interest to the case put forward by the Leader of the Country Party. There are reasonable points in it- quite reasonable indeed. Of course, we can discount the usual union baiting and union hating that is generally associated with speeches that emanate from him and from his Party. </para>

          <para>The hard facts are these: The royal commission to which he referred has already been asked to investigate precisely the matters that he has raised. We are far from satisfied with the distribution in Australia of every form of motor spirit and derivatives of crude oil. We have reason to be. One of the worst examples is that there are only two major refineries in Sydney. These are the Shell refinery at Clyde and the Caltex refinery at Kurnell. The product swapping which takes place would reveal to the ordinary motorist the fact that the products of oil companies are all the same despite the much vaunted advertising. </para>
          <para>This matter does concern us greatly. One of the instructions that has been given to the counsel representing the Commonwealth at the royal commission is that he should ask that the production by refineries be shared. In the recent troubles that have occurred in Sydney we had complaints in one case that a rival refinery from Queensland which had won a contract for the supply of Transport Commission fuel requirements in New South Wales found that, because of a temporary shortage, the swapping arrangement did not operate. The refinery involved made sure that its own customers were served first. There must be sharing by refineries. There is one refinery in Sydney which is notorious for its provocative treatment of the trade union movement. We want no more of the general trouble that has existed between the management of that refinery and the trade union movement. We do not intend to have any more of it. A very good suggestion has come from the association representing service station owners. This is that the different oil companies ought to keep tanks at service stations sealed and filled. </para>

              <para>- What the Opposition argues is not the root cause of it at all. It is refreshing indeed to hear from the Leader of the Country Party that in fact there are adequate fuel supplies in Australia. I have heard his jeremias time and again that Australia is going to run short of fuel. The position today is nothing of the sort. In Australia there is more recoverable fuel than ever before in terms of crude, oil and liquids associated with crude oil. The annual throughput of the refineries in Australia is 220 million barrels a year. Australia has at the moment reserves of 3,300 million barrels. That is the position up to date. It is quite remarkable that recently the Esso-BHP organisation estimated that it had an extra 22 per cent of reserves. So,&#39; I do not want to hear any more nonsense from&#39; &#39;the Opposition about what the fuel position is. At present day consumption rates Australia has. 15 years of fuel supply in reserve. If honourable members divide 3,300 million barrels of reserves by the annual consumption of 220 million barrels, they should obtain the answer that Australia ;has 15 years in fuel reserves. Plenty of time should&#39; be available for us to follow the other alternatives that present themselves to us. If we want to- know the exact position with regard to fuel and- oil supplies in Australia as the question has been raised about the frequency of supplies, I have mentioned it and my colleague, the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> will be dealing with the industrial aspects. </para>

              <para>-To illustrate the exact position, I quote from the head of the Esso company, the main oil company in Australia in terms of throughput. I speak of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kruizenga,</inline> who pointed out: . . . Australia is not one of the countries with cause for anxiety on the energy score. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Coal reserves are more than ample for the country&#39;s needs. It looks as though there is plenty of natural gas for the foreseeable future. Uranium supplies are available for internal use and export. The only potential problem is on the crude oil side. If you go back you will see the track record has not been too encouraging for oil exploration. The only really successful area has been in the Gippsland Basin. </para>
          <para>But even without further major discoveries, it is feasible for Australia to be reasonably self-sufficient by coupling existing resources to new technology ... In a world of expensive energy and supply difficulties that&#39;s a pretty good position for a country to be in. </para>
          <para class="block">Today Australia is one of the few countries- let us forget temporary disruptions caused by industrial disputes- where one can roll up one &#39;-s truck or one&#39;s car and get fuel supplies. It is the one country, with the exception of the Arab countries, where one can buy one &#39;s fuel supplies at the cheapest rate possible. We have kept the price down, and we intend to continue to do so, the propaganda of the friends of Broken Hill Proprietary notwithstanding. There again, the arch culprit is the Leader of the Country Party. </para>
          <para>On the subject of oil prices, let this also be clearly understood: The cost of Australian crude today does not vary very much from the cost of crude from the East. The reason is that the biggest part of the cost of imported crude, which is landed today at $7.25 a barrel, consists of tax. When you deduct that tax, which is taken by the respective producing countries, you will find that the crude is just about on a par with the Aus.tralian product because we have not chosen to flog the consumer and we do not intend to do so. The farmers in Australia today can buy their fuel, their petrol and distillate, cheaper than it can be bought in any other industrialised country in the world. </para>
          <para>On the question of LPG- and very little was said about this by the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party- I quote from a report from the Hydro-Carbons Branch of my Department. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The LPG from refineries is distributed mainly by road wagons or rail tank cars. The volume of storage for this product is low partly because the cost of storage tanks is high. Estimates vary from $500 to $1,000 per ton of product capacity . . . </para>
            <para>In all States the production of LPG in refineries is less than the consumption and the shortfall is met by imports of LPG from Westernport. During 1973 the refinery and petrochemical production of LPG was 338,000 tons and the usage of Bass Strait LPG in Australia was 42,000 tons, out of over 1 million tons production. </para>

            <para>LPG produced from Bass Strait at Longford is transported to Long Island Point by pipeline and there separated to propane and butane. The great bulk is shipped to Japan, but smaller quantities are shipped to New South Wales, Queensland and other States in small foreign tankers. These tankers vary in capacity from 300-900 tons: larger vessels cannot be used because of the lack of storage capacity already referred to. A particular example of this is the fact that when shipments are made to Sydney they have to be unloaded from the ship into road and rail wagons for transfer to storages. This means that the ship is held up for a much longer period than necessary, which adds to the cost of the shipment </para>
            <para>LPG is also moved from Bass Strait by road and rail for supply to country centres in Victoria and New South Wales. There is at present no properly fitted siding for loading LPG into rail cars at Long Island Point and the procedure adopted is to carry LPG by road wagon to the siding at Bittern and transfer it there into the rail car. An additional problem for rail supply to New South Wales is the change of gauge at Albury, necessitating bogie change. </para>
            <para>There are both physical and economic problems in supplying LPG to centres in New South Wales and Queensland from Westernport. The physical problems are the shortages of storage, snipping, and of road wagons and rail cars. The shortage sets a ceiling to the amount that can be transferred in this manner. We have been informed by several of the companies that they have road and rail wagons on order but the shortage of steel and other problems have delayed the delivery long beyond the promised date. </para>
            <para>In regard to shipment by sea, reference has already been made to the problem of storage capacity to receive shipments, resulting in the available LPG tanker capacity being inadequate to meet the demand during the winter months . . . </para>
            <para>The economic problem of bringing LPG from Westernport is the transport cost involved, for example the freight by coastal tanker from Westernport to Sydney is $30 per ton and the cost of carriage by road is similar. Esso quoted $30 per ton for road transport to Wagga Wagga, although the Wagga Council Gas Supply undertaking, by purchasing and operating their own road tank wagon at a cost of $60,000 claim to have reduced the cost to half of this amount. The rail freight ... for transport from Bittern to Sydney is $34.55 per ton but there is also the cost of road transfer .. . </para>

          <para>In fact, the major oil companies have been thumbing their noses at the price findings of the Prices Justification Tribunal. They sought a price of $57 a ton and were awarded a price of $42 a ton. They then said that they would prefer to burn the LPG as fuel in refineries and, alternatively, to convert it into motor spirit. You can have that at a price, and it is the responsibility of the major oil companies, who have access to the cheapest crude oil in the world today, to provide a reasonable distribution system. We intend to see that they provide it. More than that, we have referred to the Attorney-General the question of whether prosecutions should not in fact issue in respect of the flouting of the recommendations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. We believe the powers are there under section 1 8 of the Act and we intend to use them. We will also ensure that by this time next year there will be no shortage, and these people will face up to their responsibilities. They have made fantastic profits in Australia. It is their responsibility to see that LPG is provided, particularly to the country consumers. </para>

              <para>- As I was saying, it is absolutely intolerable that, as a result of this Government&#39;s condonation of industrial anarchy, it should sit idly by while the front lines of Australia &#39;s defences the planes of the Air Force and the ships of the Navy- are completely immobilised over long periods. In Darwin only the week before last I saw, with my own eyes, because I went to have a look, 6 Fl 1 1 aircraft and a squadron of Mirage aircraft unable to return to their home bases in Queensland and New South Wales because of the fuel shortage. </para>

              <para>-The Minister for Minerals and Energy seems to be fairly sensitive about this problem. Not only was the front line of the Royal Australian Air Force stuck in Darwin as a result of this situation but industrial disputes also forced the withdrawal of Has &#39;Melbourne&#39; from a major international exercise. We are the laughing stock of the world as a result. (Honourable members interjecting)- </para>

              <para>- The defence of this country was involved, the pride of this country was involved, the commitments of this country were involved, our position in the world was involved; yet this Minister who for 8 days is to be left as Acting Prime Minister of Australia says: &#39;We did it because we did not want to create industrial upheaval&#39;. That was his interjection. It will be recorded in Hansard. This Minister is going to be the Acting Prime Minister of Australia. I hope that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> after seeing this Minister&#39;s performance today, will have another think about his decision to leave the Minister in charge because it will be absolutely disastrous. Not only was the &#39;Melbourne&#39; held up but the industrial situation also held up the fitting and repair of most of the Royal Australian Navy&#39;s major ships. It brought the RAAF and RAN flying training to a standstill. Surveillance of the Australian coast by RAN patrol boats from Cairns ceased during this period yet the Government could not care less. The fact is that Indonesian fishermen are landing on our coast at the risk of foot and mouth disease to the stock of Australia. There is an inadequate number of patrol boats. </para>

              <para>-The only solution we have got from the Opposition to all of the problems that we are now debating is that there ought to be compulsory secret strike ballots. Anyone would think that this was a novel or revolutionary idea that has just been dreamed up and that would have been put into the statute book years ago if the Opposition could have thought about it and presumably, if it had been accepted by the Opposition when it was in government for 23 years, it would have used that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to force a secret ballot. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Le me tell the House something about the Act. It appears that those who have taken part in the debate so far from the other side know little about it. For nearly 50 years now there has been a provision in the Act to permit this sort of thing to be done. For the 23 years that the Opposition was in government it did not once as a government invoke the provision of the Act that gave it the right to order a secret ballot in respect of strikes. The reason that it did not do it is that it could not do it No government can do it. The Act says that where an organisation is a party to an industrial dispute and where the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission thinks that the settlement of the dispute would be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitude of the members of the organisation in relation to the matter, the Commission may order that a vote of those members for the purpose of ascertaining their views or attitude in relation to that matter be taken by secret ballot in accordance with the directions given by the Commission. The Commission can order the ballot to be taken by the Registrar and the Registrar can order that it be taken by the electoral officer. The powers of the Commission are exercisable only by a presidential member or by a full bench and not otherwise. That is not our section; that is the section which was put into the Act by the Opposition when it was in government The Opposition proposed that in no circumstances could the government exercise this power. </para>
          <para>The Act then goes on to say that where the Commission orders the holding of a secret ballot, it may order and direct the organisation concerned to make arrangements for the conduct of the ballot by a person approved by the Industrial Registrar. An organisation to whom the direction has been given under this section shall comply with the direction. A person shall not, in connection with a ballot ordered by the section, obstruct the taking of the ballot, use any form of intimidation, threaten, or in any way suggest that a person might vote in a particular way or that he be forced to omit to vote or that he be forced to support or oppose a proposition or that he should promise to vote or that he should show his ballot paper to any other person than the person who is registering the vote. The penalty for anybody who commits an offence against these sections of the Act is a cool $500 or imprisonment for 6 months or both. That can be done at any time an employer chooses to make an application to the Commission. </para>
          <para>Only the party to an award has the power to make an application, not the government. This was the decision of the present Opposition. It was the Opposition&#39;s amendment to the Act in 1972 that made it quite clear that the Government could never in any circumstances make application. It was the Opposition&#39;s amendment which said that only those who were parties to the award would have the right to apply. It was the Opposition&#39;s amendment which said that the application can be heard only by a presidential member or by the full bench of the Commission. So what does the Opposition mean when it talks about secret ballots? The only occasion on which a secret ballot has ever been held under this legislation was in 1929 during the famous or the infamous, depending how one looks at it, timber workers&#39; strike. When the secret ballot was held more than two-thirds of the membership voted in favour of the strike continuing and, having done that, it was then found that they had to stick by the decision.

        <para class="block">Customs Tariff Proposals No. 1 1 (1974) which I have just tabled, formally placed before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by Gazette notice on 20 August 1794. Honourable members will recall that on 18 July when I introduced tariff proposals arising from the Tariff Board&#39;s report on &#39;Film Processing Industry; Advertising Film (Value for Duty)&#39; I mentioned that the changes relating to exposed and developed plates or film, other than cinematograph film, were being withheld pending the completion of international negotiations. These negotiations have been completed and a rate of 14 per cent applied to lantern slides, film strip transparencies and stereoscopic views. Other plates and film, other than cinematograph film, are now dutiable at 35 per cent. </para>
        <para>Proposals No. 11 (1974) also corrects an anomaly in the expression of the developing countries rate applicable to certain paper and paperboard. In addition provision is being maintained in the scheme of tariff preferences for developing countries for admission until 31 December 1974 of certain men&#39;s and boys&#39; overcoats at a concessional rate of 10 per cent subject to quota limitations. I commend the Proposals. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a non repayable grant of $2.56m to the Queensland Government towards the cost of constructing stage 2 of the Ross River Dam near Townsville. The Queensland Government and the Townsville City Council will together meet the balance of the cost of stage 2, at present estimated at $5. 12m. The construction of stage 2 is being advanced to ensure adequate water supplies for the fast growing population of Townsville and neighbouring areas in the Shire of Thuringowa now totalling about 80,000 persons and expected to reach 100,000 by 1980. Stage 2 of the dam construction will ensure an additional daily supply of 83.8 mega litres (18.4 million gallons) bringing the total daily supply for Townsville and its environs from all sources to about 166.4 mega litres (36.6 million gallons) for domestic, industrial and municipal purposes. It will also provide for increased domestic consumption levels which are limited by the present restrictions because supplies are often severely inadequate over drier periods. </para>
          <para>There are other important implications for Townsville in stage 2 of the Ross River Dam project. Flood mitigation storage will be increased and Townsville will be virtually secure from flooding in the Ross River. This will enable the City Council to plan with confidence the future use of large areas of flood-prone land under its control. Further, this storage of some 417,000 mega litres (338,000 acre feet) only 30 kilometres from the centre of the largest city in northern Australia should provide valuable opportunities for relaxation and recreation. Proposals are being examined to have the storage area declared a flora and fauna reserve. The construction of stage 2 involves raising the height of the stage 1 spillway by 6.5 metres (21.5 feet) and the embankments by 4 metres (13 feet), including the placement of some 1.53 million cubic metres (2 million cubic yards) of earth, sand and rock fill. In addition, about 16 kilometres (10 miles) each of the Flinders Highway and the Great Northern Railway will need to be relocated due to the enlargement of the storage area. </para>
          <para>Townsville is a city of considerable importance, not only to the north, but to Australia generally. Its major industries are export-orientated, based on the rich resources of its hinterland including a copper refinery to process concentrates from Mount Isa, a nickel refinery now under construction to handle the output from the Greenvale nickel deposits and 3 abattoirs, two of which process livestock mainly for export. Townsville also handles exports of sugar from the Burdekin region, one of Australia&#39;s most important sugar districts. Townsville has been selected by the Australian Government as a possible growth centre. Indeed, its growth over recent years owes much to Australian Government decisions, such as the location of defence installations, the establishment and growth of the James Cook University and work now in progress on the Institute of Marine Science at Cape Cleveland. The prospective provision of international air traffic facilities at Townsville would provide a further stimulus to growth. In fact, it was specifically in recognition of the burden on the public utilities of Townsville created by such Australian Government initiatives that we decided to provide a grant of $ 1.5m in 1973 towards the cost of constructing stage 1 of the Ross River Dam. </para>
          <para>The Department of Northern Development and the Department of Urban and Regional Development have worked in close consultation on this matter, examining all aspects of water supply and demand within the context of our policies in respect of northern development and regional growth centres. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, at the request of the Department of Northern Development, reviewed the design and cost estimates of the engineering works and an interdisciplinary panel of senior State officers examined the likely environmental impact of stage 2. No adverse environmental consequences were foreshadowed. The Government believes that an adequate supply of water will be a major incentive for future growth in the Townsville area. Water consumption in the tropics is inevitably higher than in most southern cities because of harsher environmental conditions and the requirement of large quantities of water for the maintenance of municipal amenities, such as parks and gardens, recreation areas and street improvements. The provision of adequate water supplies is also an indispensable condition for the location and development of new industrial enterprises on which the long term growth of Townsville will depend. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to obtain approval for an agreement which has been negotiated with the Queensland Government under which the Australian Government will provide a loan of $2m during this financial year to the State towards the cost of constructing Julius Dam on the Leichhardt River at a site about 65 kilometres east of Mount Isa. Construction of the dam is to be financed by Mount Isa Mines Ltd, the Mount Isa City Council and the Queensland Government. The estimated cost of the dam is $ 10m with an estimated further cost of $ 1 5.2m to cover pumps and a pipeline supply system. The Queensland Government&#39;s share of the total estimated cost of $25.2m is $7.3m and includes an amount of $3.9m to enable the dam to be built with spare capacity to cater for the expected growth requirements of the area. Julius Dam with a storage capacity of 123,500 mega litres, is being constructed in the Selwyn Ranges some 1,500 kilometres north-west of Brisbane. Rainfall in this region is low, averaging less than 400 millimetres a year and both monthly and annual falls are variable resulting often in severe water shortages over long periods and sometimes in serious floods. The extremely high annual evaporation of 3,230 millimetres leaves an annual deficit of 2,830 millimetres and is the major cause of low yields from water storages. </para>
          <para>The whole area is highly mineralised and known reserves of silver, lead and copper ores have been increased as a result of recent exploration, whilst the economic feasibility of developing other mineral deposits has been proved. Mining started at Mount Isa in February 1923 in primitive conditions; transport through the Selwyn Ranges was difficult, and the only water available was from sandy pools in the bed of the Leichhardt River. During its first 50 years of development, water has been an extremely important constraint to progress at Mount Isa. The first water supply was provided by damming Rifle Creek in 1929 and this supply was supplemented by bore water. Later, supplies were further augmented by the construction of Lake Koongarra in 1955, and it is obvious that further development will rely on additional water supplies. </para>
          <para>The population of Mount Isa at the 1971 census was 25,200, representing an increase of 8,200 since 1966 at an average annual growth rate of 8&#189; per cent over the census period. I am sure there is general agreement that people living in arid areas under uncomfortable climatic conditions for many months of the year should have access to assured water supplies for domestic and municipal purposes. The demand for water for mining activities is also expected to increase. Mount Isa Mines is developing a new mine at Hilton some 16 kilometres north of the present workings. Operations at the Hilton mine are expected to commence around 1977-78. Other prospective users of water, such as the phosphate mine at Lady Annie and copper  mining  at Kajabbi, are likely to begin operations at a later date. Julius Dam is expected to be completed by 1975 and, therefore, there will be some considerable delay between the completion of the dam and the main demand for water. </para>
          <para>The loan to the State of Queensland is basically to enable the State to assist in the development of our valuable northern mineral resources. This loan, together with funds provided by Queensland, will ensure a supply of water in anticipation of the expected demand by mining industries. It will ensure that workers and their families will be able to enjoy some of the amenities which people in southern Australia often take for granted. I am, nevertheless, concerned at the high level of water charges which may have to be levied by the Mount Isa Council to meet its share of the dam and distribution works. An offer of a loan of $2m to the State of Queensland was made by the Australian Government in October 1972 and confirmed by this Government with improved terms to ease the burden of repayments until the expected demand for water develops. This new offer has been accepted by the Premier of Queensland under the terms set out in the schedule to this Bill. </para>
          <para>The mining industries of northern Australia are making a noteworthy and vitally important contribution to the economy of Australia. They will continue to do so in the future and, in one way or another, we must assure that the heavy burden of costs for water, transport and other basic facilities does not act as a deterrent to those people whose personal contribution is indispensable to the success of the development of our northern resources. I commend this Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill provides grants for universities for a number of purposes- for universities to undertake programs high in the Government&#39;s social and educational purposes. Special grants are to be available to specified universities to increase teaching and research in special education of the handicapped, to establish courses or chairs of community practice associated with community health centres, and to increase the number of social workers in training. We believe these programs will produce sound professional staff and add to the community&#39;s capacity to meet needs in these fields. </para>
          <para>Secondly, funds are to be provided to the University of Newcastle to allow for the planning of a new medical school in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on Medical Schools of the Universities Commission. Thirdly, the Bill provides for an Australian Government contribution towards the costs of acquiring the site of a new university at Campbelltown, New South Wales. Further assistance towards the development of this university will be provided when the Government considers the recommendations of the Universities Commission for the triennium 1976-78. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for administrative matters which have arisen since legislation on grants to universities was passed by the Parliament during the Autumn sittings of 1973. Monash University proposed to speed the introduction of a social work course and special assistance was provided for this purpose. Unfortunately, the University found that it was unable to achieve its objective, and the additional earmarked grant is to be repealed. In the legislation enacted during the 1973 Budget sittings provision was also made in Part IV of the First Schedule to the Act to establish a School of Management Education at the University of New South Wales. Necessary amendments in Parts II and III of the First Schedule to accord with this provision were overlooked. This Bill makes the necessary machinery amendment although this does not represent any increase in the commitment of funds beyond that already intended in the previous legislation. </para>
          <para>When the Australian Government assumed full financial responsibility for tertiary education from January 1974 amendment was necessary for proportions of payments to be made by the State governments. In section 8 of the principal Act which is related to student residential accommodation, the word &#39;one-twentfth&#39; was included as the States&#39; share but this related to total cost and not to the amounts shown in the relevant Schedule attached to the Act which represent the Australian Government contribution. It is necessary to amend the proportion from &#39;onetwelfth&#39; to &#39;one-eighth&#39;. The State governments are aware of the need for this particular amendment to the legislation. </para>
          <para>As I have already mentioned, the Australian Government assumed full responsibility for the financing of tertiary education from 1 January 1974 and since that time it has become evident that one of the exceptions contained in the existing definition of &#39;fees&#39; in the principal Act relating to fees payable to student organisations requires clarification. Provision has been made in the Bill to provide for this clarification. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing States Grants (Universities) Act 1972-73 to make the financial provisions and the necessary machinery and administrative amendments I have mentioned. The measures included in the Bill require a financial commitment of $840,000 for capital expenditure, and $345,000 in 1974 and $563,000 in 1975 for recurrent purposes. I hope the Parliament will enable this Bill to become an Act. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill is designed to provide extra funds for sewerage backlog programs in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Honourable gentlemen will be familiar with the vast national sewerage program introduced by the Australian Government to tackle the backlog in Australian sewerage programs. The Government regards the removal of the sewerage backlog and the ability of State and local government authorities to keep pace with the demand for new services as a yardstick of social progress in Australia. </para>
          <para>If we cannot provide the most basic of all services then quite clearly the structure of government in this country has failed the people it purports to serve. We have no cause for pride in the quality of services when millions of gallons of raw sewage is pumped each week into the seas off our coast, bays and inlets and into metropolitan rivers and creeks. A warning is sounded for future generations when we find that our rivers are recording a level of pollution from sewage which is alarmingly high. </para>

We do not want to see our oceans and waterways converted into running cesspools in the way that the great rivers of Europe have been polluted. The tragic experience of the Mediterranean and the Rhine, Elbe and Danube Rivers is a reminder to us of what can happen to our own seas, streams and rivers which are still untainted. For these reasons we have stressed the importance of this scheme and our determination to remove the sewerage backlog over the next 8 years. In particular the national sewerage program gives expression to our concern that all new land subdivisions should be given adequate sewerage treatment facilities. We also insist that these treatment facilities should meet standards which safeguard our environment. No house now being built should have to wait for long to be connected to a complete sewerage system. </para>
          <para>Beating the sewerage backlog breaks down into 2 parts- connection to a reticulated sewerage system, and overcoming inadequate trunk sewers and treatment standards. About one-sixth of the main urban areas of Australia were answered at December 1972 when this Government took office. They are the last figures available. There are many examples of the inadequacy of urban trunk sewerage mains and treatment works. I do not want to list them here. I have given details of them previously. I have touched on their existence to indicate the size of the problem and the level of capital spending that will be required to overcome them. They reinforce the point that these great problems will not be solved without heavy capital spending. Spending on sewerage works soaks up an enormous amount of capital, both for the expansion of services to meet growing populations and to chop out the backlog in services which now exists. It means that the States and local government cannot tackle the backlog and at the same time keep up with new services without strong support from the Australian Government. Without that support it is not possible, and it has not been possible in the past Unfortunately the sad thing was that previous Australian Governments would not become involved in the problems of urban areas. </para>
          <para>Provision of sewerage is often made difficult because of the existence of hilly, rocky and swampy country in many of the new areas developed around our cities. Septic tanks can provide a substitute in sparsely settled and relatively flat areas but it is at best a poor substitute. In fact in some cases, such as on the Gold Coast, a septic tank system in times of flood may become more dangerous than a system without septic tanks. In densely settled areas which have high water tables or are rocky or swampy the septic tank is no substitute for reticulated sewerage. We concede these difficulties but we are determined to overcome them and to provide the strongest possible lead for State and local government authorities to give the Australian people proper sewerage. </para>
          <para>It is appalling to have to record that the sewerage from 400,000 people in Brisbane is still discharged untreated into Moreton Bay at the mouth of the Brisbane River. The Melbourne Press in the past year has been studded with report of high levels of pollution from sewage on the beaches and bays of Melbourne. Quite often in Melbourne heavy rains force overflows of sewage into the city&#39;s storm water drainage systems. This noxious waste is then transmitted through the suburbs of Melbourne. Most metropolitan streams in Australia record levels of E.coli which are completely unacceptable to this Government. These are examples of the social evils the extra assistance given by this Bill is designed to remove from our cities and countryside. </para>
          <para>The Sewerage Agreements Act 1973 appropriated $30m of loan funds at the long term bond rate to the States for sewerage backlog works for 1973-74. This was in this year only. In the new program which will be announced tonight will be a different arrangement which will be explained by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean).</inline> I stress that this is additional to the normal allocation of loan money each year to the States for sewerage works. This program was tailored to fit the ability of the State sewerage authorities to speed up their works programs after this allocation was made. With one exception, the initial allocations to the States in 1973-74 have been spent. The total program for 1973-74 included 81 reticulation projects, 35 main, sub-main and carrier sewer projects, 6 pumping stations and 10 treatment plants. In the course of the 1973-74 financial year, it became clear that Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia needed further financial assistance. This was necessary to keep up the existing rate of progress of works throughout the whole of the year. It is important that the momentum built up by this program should be maintained so that the sewerage backlog in the main urban areas disappears in the shortest possible time. The Government&#39;s advisers reviewed the programs and we decided on agreements with the 3 State Governments for the extra works and extra moneys. These agreements will be effective once this Bill is passed. But for the double dissolution it would have been introduced in the autumn session of Parliament. </para>
          <para>Turning to the assistance sought by the States, Victoria asked for $3.95m, Queensland $2m, and Western Australia $3m. We have agreed to these allocations except for Queensland, where $lm will be made available. This means that the total allocation of financial assistance for sewerage backlog in 1973-74- the first year of administration of this Government- will be $37.95m. It will be distributed between the States in this way: New South Wales, $ 11.2m; Victoria, $ 13.25m; Queensland, $4.1m; South Australia, $1.6m; Western Australia, $6.8m; and Tasmania, $lm. The extra money will be made available on the same terms and conditions as in the Sewerage Agreements Act 1973. We have carefully assessed the impact of these programs on manpower and material resources. Most of the works have already been completed and therefore will involve no significant pressure on resources. Where works will not be completed for some months we have ensured that our allocations will not impose a strain on resources of both men and materials. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the programs for each of the States. The program in Victoria is important because good progress has already been made and the extra money will enable greater inroads into the sewerage backlog to be made. I am convinced that the additional funds will accelerate the strong drive the Melbourne authorities have started against pollution in metropolitan streams and along the bay-side beaches. It is only in such a co-operative manner that we can solve the problem </para>
          <para>In Queensland, the extra assistance will be concentrated on projects designed to remove the backlog of poor sewerage services in Brisbane. It will include the start of the Luggage Point treatment plant which will treat sewage from the main sewerage area of Brisbane to comply with Water Quality Council standards. This will bring important benefits to the environment in central Brisbane and in the outer suburbs of the city. </para>
          <para>In Western Australia, the extra assistance will mean that existing programs will be maintained at peak level. Without this assistance, the Perth Metropolitan Water Board would have to cut back its accelerated works program, and this would mean a reduction in contract staff. With regard to longer term programs, in the Budget session the Government will announce details of the form and level of finance to be provided. We have to solve these problems together. It has to be a co-operative effort between the Australian and State governments and local authorities. We intend to set out to work together in a cooperative way in what we call a spirit of cooperative federalism to try to solve these problems. The level of financial assistance under this Bill now before the House has been taken into account in preparing the long-term program. I ask honourable members to note that the form and level of finance proposed under the long term program cannot be anticipated from the financial arrangements under this Bill. </para>
          <para>In summary, this Bill provides extra amounts of up to $3m to Western Australia, $3. 95m to Victoria and $lm to Queensland in the 1974-75 fiscal year as part of the program to cut out the sewerage backlog. The extra money will allow the level of activity reached under the existing accelerated program to be maintained. The funds will be provided under the same terms and conditions as in the Sewerage Agreements Act of 1973, a matter which I drew to the attention of the House earlier. This arrangement applied to that year only and a new arrangement will be announced tonight by the Treasurer. This was the first real drive of an Australian government to work together with the States and local authorities to overtake the backlog of sewerage, to protect the environment and to give every person living in an urban community the right to sewerage and better environmental conditions. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill 1974 and the Papua New Guinea Bill 1974 is to give effect to a request by the Government of Papua New Guinea that the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly be given authority to legislate with respect to mining for petroleum and other minerals in the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea as defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1973. With the advent of self government in Papua New Guinea on 1 December 1973 authority over all functions of government passed to the control of Papua New Guinea with the exception of a small number of functions which were reserved to Australia- the most important of these being defence and foreign relations. </para>
          <para>Authority over the function of off-shore mining passed to Papua New Guinea and Papua New Guinea had the right, consistently with self government, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> legislate in regard to offshore mining. As an interim measure, until the necessary legislation could be enacted, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is designated authority in respect of the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea, under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, delegated his authority to the Papua New Guinea Minister for Mines and Energy and certain Papua New Guinea Government officials. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government agreed to permit Papua New Guinea to enact its own legislation subject to 2 conditions. These are that: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">
              <para>It will not, prior to independence, introduce legislation purporting to regulate off-shore mining in areas beyond the outer limits of the continental shelf within the meaning of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf nor will it act inconsistently with any international convention relating to the law of the sea to which Australia is a party; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="2.">
              <para>Adequate safeguards as to the environment should be applied during the exploration stage, and if oil or gas should be discovered within the &#39;adjacent areas&#39;, it would consult with the Australian Government and seek the advice of an independent authority to ensure that commercial exploitation would not commence until the environment was adequately safeguarded. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Papua New Guinea Chief Minister has agreed to these 2 conditions. He has also indicated that the Papua New Guinea Government shares Australia&#39;s concern to protect the environment. </para>
          <para>Taking these Bills in turn, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill provides for the repeal from a date to be proclaimed of the provisions of the principal Act that extend to Papua New Guinea. This date will be the date of commencement of Papua New Guinea&#39;s own off-shore legislation. Clause 4 amends section 7 of the principal Act by ceasing its extension to Papua New Guinea and clause 5 omits reference to the Australian Minister as the designated authority in respect of the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea. Clause 6 repeals the section of the principal Act which deals with the payment of fees, royalties, etc., to Papua New Guinea and provides that any moneys received by Australia before the date of commencement of this Act are to be paid to Papua New Guinea. Clause 8 removes the description of the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea from the second schedule to the principal Act. </para>
          <para>The Papua New Guinea Bill puts beyond doubt the authority of the House of Assembly to legislate with regard to offshore mining. Clause 3 of this Bill inserts a new section in the principal </para>
          <para class="block">Act to clarify the authority of the House of Assembly to legislate in the offshore area, as defined in the new section, and provides that such authority shall not be construed as limiting by implication any other power of the House of Assembly to make laws under the principal Act. I draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that Papua New Guinea&#39;s authority to legislate with regard to off-shore mining is confined to the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the adjacent areas of Papua New Guinea and that Papua New Guinea has agreed to conform to Australia&#39;s international obligations in regard to the law of the sea conventions. </para>
          <para>Although the function of Papua New Guinea &#39;s foreign relations is reserved to Australia, the policy of the Australian Government has been to involve fully Papua New Guinea and to exercise that function only after the fullest consultation with and advice from the Papua New Guinea Government. Consistent with this policy Australia has encouraged Papua New Guinea to take its place in the international community and one example of Papua New Guinea&#39;s increasing involvement in this community was its participation in the recent Law of the Sea Conference in Caracas. </para>
          <para>The Bills I am introducing are a further step in the devolution of authority to Papua New Guinea so that when independence comes there will not be one aspect of government with which Papua New Guinea will not be familiar and experienced.

          </talker>
          <para>- I will say it again: An economy subjected to exceptional strains. We share with all our major trading partners problems of economic management unparalleled in modern times. Yet it must be emphasised that these problems flow from Australia&#39;s basic strength and real prosperity. In the past year- and those honourable members who have studied the White Paper on national income can read it for themselves- gross domestic product increased in real terms by 5% per cent. Civilian employment rose by a record 218,000. Incomes rose strongly in both real and dollar terms. </para>
        </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Partly because of this increase in incomes, price increases have been large and widespread. Until recently, we have experienced severe shortages and delays in the supply of a wide range of goods and materials and a disturbingly high incidence of industrial disputes. </para>
        <para>The Government acted decisively to ease the excess pressures on the economy prevalent during most of 1973-74. Firm action was taken through monetary policy to moderate excessive demands and through exchange rate adjustments and tariff reductions to increase supplies. In the event, nearly one-half of the increase in demand was satisfied by the increase in imports resulting from our external policies. </para>
        <para>These actions have achieved their objective. Demand pressures in the private sector have abated in recent months. After strong growth in the first half of 1973-74, capital spending by business declined slightly in real terms in the second half of the year. Investment in new dwellings, which had been far outstripping the growth in building resources, is now more in line with the supplies available. Though remaining reasonably buoyant, consumer spending is now a less dominant expansionary force than it was during much of 1 973-74. </para>
        <para>The abatement in demand pressures is evidenced also in the labour market. Unemployment has increased and overtime working has diminished. </para>
        <para>Although demand pressures are being contained, powerful cost pressures have been unleashed which threaten further unsettling price increases. In that connection I mention that the Government is exploring a tax penalty mechanism by which wage and salary increases beyond an established norm might be excluded from assessable costs for the assessment of company income tax. </para>
        <para>The conventional response to inflation has relied almost entirely on the creation of mass unemployment. Those who advocate such a course in present conditions are unable to say what level of unemployment would markedly reduce inflation. The Government is not prepared deliberately to create a level of 4 or 5 per cent, or perhaps even higher unemployment. </para>
        <para>The Government is convinced that the best course is to attack the cost price spiral directly. We are pursuing this course in discussions with the State Governments arising from the recent special conference with Premiers. We have also engaged in discussions with unions and employers, particularly in the context of the Moore Conference. This form of action depends upon widespread and unusual co-operation. To rely on unemployment to reduce cost pressures would inhibit that co-operation and could destroy the Government&#39;s right to claim it. The Government will not close off its options until the possibilities of co-operation have been given a proper test. </para>
        <para>However, decisions taken in the Budget context remain important in this overall strategy. We must maintain control over total demand to prevent excessive demand pressures emerging again. The expansion in the public sector contained in this Budget is designed to take up the slack emerging in the private sector. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s appeal for restraint on wages and prices will, I believe, be reinforced by the decisions, particularly on the tax side, which I shall shortly announce. In making their wage claims, employees should recognise that the Government expects the principal burden of restraint to fall on upper income groups, particularly through the impact on profits of the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal and by the substantial redistribution of incomes which will arise from this Budget, particularly from the amendments to the income tax system and the new provisions for the taxation of property incomes and capital gains. The possibility of restraint from all sections of the community will be enhanced by the decisions I will announce designed to reduce the burdens on and increase the benefits for wage earners and particularly low and single income families. </para>
        <para>The Government will continue to be flexible in its use of policy instruments to meet any difficulties which emerge- as illustrated by the action earlier this month to enable the Savings Banks to increase their lending for housing, and by the recently announced decision to institute a Regional Employment Development Scheme. Should the need arise, we stand ready during the year to take action on the expenditure or revenue side of the Budget to give a quick stimulus to demand and employment. </para>
        <para>Crucial as the fight against inflation is, it cannot be made the sole objective of Government policy. This Government is committed to the program of social reform to improve the position of the less privileged groups in our society and to maintain employment opportunities. We intend to pursue those programs and objectives without significant increase in the public service which will be held to the increase in operative staff of 1 per cent previously announced. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s overriding objective is to get on with our various initiatives in the fields of education, health, social welfare and urban improvement. The relatively subdued conditions in prospect on the private sector provide the first real opportunity we have had to transfer resources to the public sector. </para>
        <para>It is against this background that we have budgeted for substantial increases in expenditure on our major programs of reform this year. </para>
        <para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para>Total Budget outlays in 1974-75 are estimated at $16,274 million an increase over actual outlays in 1973-74 of $3,980 million or 32.4 per cent. </para>

          <para>- And inflation- but substance as well. These include the new programs of expenditure on primary and secondary schools being administered by the Schools Commission; the Government&#39;s undertaking of total financial responsibility for tertiary education throughout Australia; the abolition of fees for tertiary and technical education; and the new student assistance measures. </para>
        </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Our expenditure on schools will increase from $234 million in the last financial year to $555 million in 1974-75, an increase of 137 per cent. On universities and colleges of advanced education, expenditure will rise from $524 million to $818 million, a 56 per cent increase. </para>
        <para>This Budget provides for important new measures in education to be introduced in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>A major new initiative will be undertaken in the field of technical and further education, based on the broad program recommended by the Kansan Committee. Subject to the understanding that the States will not reduce the level of their own activities in technical education, we expect to spend $96.5 million in the States on this program in two years, and have provided $49.1 million for this purpose in 1974-75. This will cover expenditure on land and buildings, including residential faculties for students, and on equipment and minor works, assistance with general recurrent expenditure, and for specific purposes such as in-service teacher education and library development. The Minister for Education will be providing details of this program. </para>
        <para>The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Schools Commission that extra funds should be allocated along the lines suggested in the Karmel Report to ensure that the impact of Schools Commission grants, and of grants under earlier programs for school science arid library facilities, is not eroded by cost increases. An amount of about $78 million will be available for this purpose during the remainder of the 1974 school year and in the 1975 school year; $48.5 million of this is included in the 1974-75 Budget. Previously, we had introduced procedures to supplement grants to universities and colleges of advanced education for the same purpose. Provision for these supplementary grants has been made for the first time in the 1974-75 Budget, at a cost of $39.2 million. </para>
        <para>Changes to existing schemes of assistance to students at secondary and tertiary levels are estimated to cost an additional $7.2 million in 1974-75. These will permit rates of allowances and means tests to be adjusted to reflect movement in costs. </para>
        <para>Details of other initiatives in education to be introduced in 1974-75 will be announced by the Minister for Education. care and education of young children </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to proceed with its full-scale program for the care and education of young children. We propose a fully integrated approach to the needs of childhood, embracing education, health and care services. An amount of $75 million has been provided in the Budget to enable a start to be made on the program by no later than 1 January 1975, and to meet existing commitments. </para>
        <para>A Children&#39;s Commission will be established to assume responsibility for administering all existing commitments in this area and for developing the new program. Meanwhile, an interim Children&#39;s Committee will be set up. </para>
        <para>Details of the Government&#39;s decisions on the care and education of young children will be the subject of a statement by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. </para>
        <para>HEALTH</para>
          <para>A Development Program for Australian Hospitals</para>
        <para>Following consideration of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission report on Hospitals in Australia, tabled in Parliament on 10 April, the Government has decided to implement a five-year program of capital assistance for the provision, expansion and modernisation of public hospital and other health institutional facilities in the States. The amount provided for 1974-75 is $28 million. To meet urgent needs for additional hospitals, arrangements will be made to acquire a site in each of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for the construction of an Australian Government hospital. </para>
          <para>Medical and Surgical Aids and Appliances</para>
        <para>The Government has recognised the need for assistance in the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances. Currently, artificial limbs and, in certain cases, hearing aids are provided free of charge. It is proposed to widen the assistance given in this field by providing free of charge, to those who need them, stoma appliances and the equipment and supplies needed for home dialysis. It is intended that stoma appliances will be distributed through hospitals and stoma associations. Home dialysis requirements will be made available through hospital dialysis and transplantation centres. </para>
          <para>Royal Flying Doctor Service</para>
        <para>The Australian Government will increase capital grants and operational subsidies for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Financial assistance for the three years commencing 1 July 1974 will comprise a capital subsidy of up to $800,000 and an operational subsidy of up to $2.1 million. The estimated cost of the additional assistance in 1974-75 is $327,000. </para>
          <para>Nursing Homes</para>
        <para>The Government is continuing its efforts to improve the position of patients in nursing homes. Nursing home benefits were increased from 1 August at an additional cost in 1 974-75 of $24.6 million. </para>
        <para>In addition, it is proposed to amend the National Health Act to authorise the Minister to enter into agreements with religious, charitable and other non-profit organisations conducting nursing homes, under which the Government will meet the deficits incurred in running the homes. It is planned to introduce this arrangement in January next. The cost in 1974-75 is estimated at $ 1.8 million. </para>
        <para>The Government has approved a special grant of $1.2 million, on a dollar- for-dollar basis, to Queensland for the erection of Stage 2 of the public nursing home complex at Wynnum. $300,000 has been provided for 1974-75. </para>
          <para>Home Nursing</para>
        <para>We propose to increase, with effect from 1 October 1 974, the existing subsidy to approved organisations providing home nursing services. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual Australian Government payment for each nurse who attracts subsidy will be increased from $4,700 to $6,200. For organisations established after that date, the annual subsidy for each nurse employed will be increased from $2,350 to $3,100. As at present, the Australian Government subsidy to any organisation will not exceed that paid to the organisation by a State. The increase m the subsidy is expected to cost $6 13,000 in 1974-75. </para>
          <para>National Drug Education Program</para>
        <para>The Government intends to continue the National Drug Education Program and for this purpose will provide $750,000 in 1974-75. Continuing support will be provided for the program during 1975-76 and 1976-77. </para>
        <para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
      <para>The Government is pressing on with its commitment to restore Australia to a position of leadership in the provision of welfare services. </para>
          <para>Social Security Benefit Rates</para>
        <para>Because this year&#39;s Budget is late, all social service pensions and benefits have already been increased. The standard (or single) rate was increased by $5 a week and the combined married rate by $6 a week. The standard rate of pension represents almost 25 per cent of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings for the June quarter 1974. Pension rates will be further reviewed in Autumn 1975. </para>
        <para>Additional pensions and benefits payable in respect of dependent children, including student children, are to be increased by 50 cents to $5.50 a week. </para>
        <para>The means-tested supplementary assistance and supplementary allowance payable to pensioners and beneficiaries who pay rent are to be increased by $1 to $5 a week. The amount of supplementary assistance payable is not to exceed actual rent paid. </para>
        <para>Orphans pension which vas introduced by this Government last year is to be increased by $1 to $11 a week. </para>
        <para class="block">Abolition of the Means Test </para>
        <para>As I indicated in my statement to the House on 23 July, the Government will be proceeding with the second step in the abolition of the means test -for residentially qualified persons aged 70 to 74 years- to take effect next April. </para>
          <para>Australian Assistance Plan</para>
        <para>Last year a pilot program provided assistance for 35 Regional Councils for Social Development to establish social planning structures at a regional level. Further impetus is now to be given to the program. Initiating grants will be provided in regions currently not assisted. Administration grants will be increased in the regions already receiving assistance and six more regional councils will be given access to capitation grants to assist local social welfare services. </para>
          <para>Dwellings for Pensioners</para>
        <para>The States Grants (Dwellings for Aged Pensioners) Act 1969, provided $25 million for non repayable interest-free grants to the States over the five years terminating in 1973-74. These grants were for the construction of dwellings to be let to single persons who were receiving an age or Service pension and who were eligible for supplementary assistance. We will now provide an amount of $30 million over the three years from 1974-75, doubling the annual grant to $10 million. The scheme will be widened to embrace the construction of dwellings to be let to single invalid and Class B widow pensioners and single Service pensioners who are permanently unemployable or suffering from tuberculosis. </para>
        <para class="block">Home Care for the Aged </para>
        <para>It is the Government&#39;s intention that the rate of capital subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act, now $2 to $1, will be increased to $4 to $1 from 1 January 1975. </para>
        <para>The personal care subsidy payable to organisations providing personal care services for the aged in approved hostel accommodation will be increased from $ 12 to $ 1 5 a week. </para>
        <para>The basic rate of subsidy paid to &#39;mealsonwheels&#39; services will be increased from 20 cents to 25 cents a meal. The increased subsidy will be payable from 1 October 1974 and will apply to meals delivered since 1 July 1974. </para>
        <para class="block">Assistance to the Handicapped </para>
        <para>Handicapped children&#39;s benefit payable to organisations is to be increased by 50 cents to $3.50 a day. </para>
        <para>We propose to introduce a Handicapped Child&#39;s Allowance of $10 a week. It is to be payable to parents and guardians in respect of a child under 16 years who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention. </para>
          <para>National Family Planning Program</para>
        <para>The Government has decided to increase grants to national family planning organisations by $75,000 to $425,000 a year. We will also initiate further measures to encourage family planning and provide advisory facilities to those who have previously lacked access to family planning advice. An amount of $700,000 has been included in the Budget for the provision of facilities and for the training of medical personnel. </para>
          <para>Structural Adjustment Assistance</para>
        <para>An amount of $ 1 1 . 8 million is provided in the Budget to assist employees displaced as a direct result of Government decisions designed to bring about significant structural changes in industry that are in the national interest. Within specified limits, income maintenance payments will be made available to individuals affected by these decisions. </para>
        <para>COMPENSATION AND REHABILITATION</para>
      <para>We have endorsed in principle the compensation scheme contained in the Report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Compensation and Rehabilitation in Australia (the Woodhouse Report) and the main enabling legislation will be introduced in the Budget sittings. The Bill will provide for a phased introduction of the scheme and, following detailed examination of the scheme by the Government and others, amendments may be made to the Act before its implementation. The only costs in 1974-75 will be for the payment of staff and consultants to plan the operation of the scheme. </para>
        <para>REPATRIATION BENEFITS</para>
      <para>There will be further substantial increases in Repatriation benefits. </para>
      <para>The Special Rate pension, or its equivalent, will be increased by $4.00 a week to $64. 10 during the Budget sittings and will be further increased by $4.00 a week during the Autumn of 1975. The maximum General Rate war pension will be increased by $3.00 a week to $25.00 during the Budget sittings and further increased by $3.00 a week during the Autumn. There will be increases in the Domestic Allowance payable to most war widows and in most other pensions and allowances paid under Repatriation legislation. The full details will be announced by the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. </para>
      <para>In addition, we have decided to introduce some new benefits in the Repatriation field. </para>
      <para>Free medical and hospital treatment for any condition will be provided for all Australian ex-servicemen and women who were interned as prisoners of war. All ex-service personnel, irrespective of whether they had service in a theatre of war, who suffer from malignant cancer, will be provided with any treatment necessary for that condition. These benefits will be introduced during the Budget sittings. </para>
      <para>Further benefits will be introduced from the Autumn of 1975. The means test on service pensions will be abolished for those aged 70 to 74 years. A further 25 per cent of all war pension payments will be disregarded as income for service pension means test purposes. Ex-service personnel who had war-time service in the Defence Forces of other countries of the British Commonwealth and who are now residing in Australia, and have done so for at least ten years, will be eligible to apply for service pensions. </para>
        <para>ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT</para>
      <para>The Government accorded a high priority to Aboriginal affairs in its Budget allocations in 1973- 74. We propose a further substantial expansion of activity this year. The Budget provides for an increase of $64.9 million in outlays on Aboriginal advancement programs in 1974- 75, to a total of $163.6 million. This provision will ensure that initiatives taken since December 1972 will be consolidated and developed for the benefit of the Aboriginal community. </para>
        <para>HOUSING</para>
          <para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>At the Premiers&#39; Conference in June, we agreed to advance $235 million to the States for welfare housing purposes in 1974-75. Taking into account that $25 million of the 1973-74 advances was not spent by the States last year, this would allow for an increase in expenditure this year of $67 million, or 34 per cent. Nevertheless, we stand ready to consult with the States on the provision of additional advances in the light of developments in the housing industry, the availability of resources for housing construction, and the ability of the States to put further funds for welfare housing to productive use. If circumstances warrrant, we will be proposing that an increased proportion of advances made to the States under the Housing Agreement be disbursed through the Home Builders&#39; Accounts to assist private home ownership for persons of low and moderate income. </para>
          <para>Australian Housing Corporation</para>
        <para>The Government proposes to introduce as soon as possible legislation to establish an Australian Housing Corporation to undertake all of those housing functions for which the Australian Government has Constitutional power. This will include direct lending by the Corporation to families for housing. The sum of $25m is being provided to enable the Corporation to undertake those housing functions which are not provided for under other appropriations. Details will be announced by the Minister for Housing and Construction. </para>
          <para>Defence Service Homes</para>
        <para>We propose to improve significantly the Defence Service Homes Scheme. Details will be announced by the Minister for Housing and Construction. The proposals include an increase in the maximum loan from $12,000 to $15,000, liberalization of eligibility conditions, and limited provisions for the transfer of a loan to another property. We have also reviewed the interest rate charged on new loans; the present rate of 3% per cent per annum will be retained on existing loans and new loans up to $12,000, but the interest rate on future loans on the amount exceeding $12,000 will be 2 per cent below the most favourable rate available from the Commonwealth Savings Bank (at present 9V4 per cent), with provision for relief for pensioners in circumstances of hardship. </para>
        <para>The provision for Defence Service Homes will be increased to $ 1 1 5 million, or $ 1 3 million more than the amount provided last year. </para>
        <para>Housing in the Territories </para>
        <para>The Budget provides $65 million for housing in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in 1 974-75, $ 14 million more than expenditure last year. This provision allows for additional funds for the Northern Territory Housing Commission, whose building program for 1973-74 was seriously interrupted by the abnormal wet season in the Territory. </para>
        <para>URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT</para>
      <para>One of the most significant initiatives of this Government has been the major effort to improve the standards of the urban environment in our cities and regions, to establish attractive alternatives to living in the major cities, and to arrest and reverse the decay of the established areas of our cities. </para>
      <para>This year we will be spending about $390 million on such programs. A comprehensive statement of outlays on urban and regional development is given in the document on that subject being tabled by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development with the Budget papers. </para>
          <para>Canberra</para>
        <para>Apart from being the national capital, Canberra is one of the most rapidly expanding urban areas in Australia. In 1974-75, $38.8 million will be spent in Canberra on acquiring and servicing land for residential, business and community uses. </para>
          <para>Growth Centres</para>
        <para>In partnership with the New South Wales and Victorian Governments we have, in the past year, established the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. This Budget provides an amount of $40 million for Albury-Wodonga, the major new growth centre initiative in South East Australia. A further $37.4 million has been provided for the establishment of other growth centres including Monarto, Geelong and Bathurst-Orange. </para>
          <para>Land Commission</para>
        <para>Last year we made a major commitment towards the establishment of Land Commissions designed to provide Australian families with land at fair prices. Subsequently, the first Land Commission was established in South Australia. The Victorian, New South Wales and Tasmanian Governments have accepted the principles of this program. For 1974-75, we are providing $54.5 million for the purchase and development of land in the States. </para>
          <para>Area Improvement</para>
        <para>Pilot schemes of area improvement have been commenced in the western sectors of Sydney and Melbourne. In addition, assistance to increase the standards of services available in 11 new regions will be commenced during 1974-75. An amount of $14.1 million has been provided for this program. </para>
          <para>Urban Rehabilitation</para>
        <para>An amount of $ 1 7.5 million has been spent on the purchase of 47 acres of residential land at Glebe, New South Wales, and a further $1 million has been provided to commence the rehabilitation of that area and to improve and increase its housing stock. </para>
          <para>Sewerage</para>
        <para>During 1973-74 we commenced a program of assistance to the States to eliminate the backlog of sewerage services. That program will be accelerated this year and the Budget provides an amount of $105 million. </para>
        <para>Last year the program was confined to the major cities. This year we are expanding it to cover provincial cities in the population range 20,000 to 60,000. </para>
        <para class="block">PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT </para>
        <para>.The Government supports a wide range of activities in the field of environmental protection and conservation. </para>
        <para>Among our new initiatives in this area, the Budget provides $250,000 for the first stage of a National Air Monitoring Program and for studies leading to the establishment of a Baseline Monitoring Station as part of Australia&#39;s contribution to the United Nations Environment Program. $100,000 is being provided for a campaign to increase public environmental awareness. </para>

            <para>-Well, we have increased it. The provision for defence outlays in 1974-75, including defence-related activities of the Department of Manufacturing Industry and other departments, is $1,498.7 million compared with actual outlays of $1,334.1 million in 1973-74. This provision for defence purposes enables the Government to continue its policy of maintaining Defence Forces which, in conformity with the present strategic outlook, sustain a proper level of defence capability and potential for future expansion. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government is proceeding with the four new major equipment projects for the Armed Forces announced in April this year, with a total commitment of some $330 million to be spread mainly over the next eight years. These projects are: eight Long Range Maritime Patrol aircraft for the RAAF, fifty-three modern medium tanks and forty-five Fire Support Vehicles for the Army, and two new destroyers for the RAN. In addition, an extensive program for the refitting and modernisation of RAN surface ships and submarines is under way. Meanwhile, production is proceeding against the orders of previous years; this involves substantial expenditure on items such as two additional Oberon submarines and ten West land Sea King helicopters. </para>
          <para>New budgetary arrangements for providing financial assistance to Papua New Guinea in respect of defence are being introduced with effect from 1 December 1974. An amount of $12.5 million is being provided for defence cooperation with, and defence financial assistance to, Papua New Guinea from that date. Estimated expenditure on defence in Papua New Guinea this year, prior to 1 December, is $ 10.2 million. </para>
          <para>Expenditure on continuing defence cooperation with a number of other friendly countries in the region of immediate strategic interest to Australia is estimated as $ 12 million. </para>
          <para>The 1974-75 Defence Program provides for reductions in civilian support manpower additional to those achieved in 1973-74. These further reductions are made possible by the rationalisation of activities. </para>
          <para>It is intended that legislation will be brought down later this year to enable the reorganisation of the Department of Defence to be put into full effect. </para>

      <para>I turn now to the area of economic services, including assistance to industry and the community generally. </para>
        <para>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</para>
          <para>Post Office</para>
        <para>The amount to be provided from the Budget to help finance the Post Office&#39;s capital program is $385 million, the same as in 1973-74. This is in accordance with the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement at the Premiers&#39; Conference on 7 June 1974. The remaining finance for the capital program will come from internal resources. </para>
        <para>As the Prime Minister also announced at the Premiers&#39; Conference, it is proposed to increase Post Office charges substantially. This is necessary to provide additional revenue in 1974-75 and to avoid substantial losses on the provision of Post Office services. The Government therefore proposes to introduce legislation to give effect, from 1 October 1974, to increases in postal and telecommunication charges similar to those rejected by the Senate in July. However, because of the delay in introduction of the higher charges resulting from the Senate&#39;s obstructionism, and the consequential loss of revenue, it has been necessary to review some of the increases previously proposed. The basic postage rate will rise to 10 cents, instead of the 9 cents that would have been sufficient if the Senate had permitted introduction of the higher charges from 1 August. The business telephone rental will be increased to $85 a year, instead of $75 as proposed earlier. </para>
        <para>Further details will be announced by the Postmaster-General. </para>
          <para>Civil Aviation</para>
        <para>In accordance with the policy announced last year of recovering 80 per cent of the cost of airport and airways facilities by 1977-78, it is proposed to increase air navigation charges from 1 December 1974 by 15 per cent, the maximum permissible under the Airlines Agreement negotiated with the two major domestic airlines last October. Charges to general aviation will be increased by an additional 50 per cent, but the rebate for aircraft not based on government aerodromes will be increased from 33 <inline font-style="italic">Vs</inline> per cent to 50 per cent. The additional revenue in 1974-75 is estimated at $3.9 million. </para>
        <para>The Department of Transport provides a wide variety of services to the aviation industry for which little or no charge is made. The Government sees no reason why these costs should not also be recovered. Accordingly, we propose that charges for these services should be introduced in 1974-75 and increased progressively so as to achieve full recovery by 1 976-77. </para>
        <para>Within the framework of the cost recovery policy, the Government has decided to proceed in 1974-75 with the construction of a new international terminal costing $4.2 million at Brisbane airport for completion in 1975, a new terminal for Hobart estimated to cost $1.3 million and extensions to the Sydney international terminal at a cost of $2.7 million. </para>
          <para>Roads</para>
        <para>Following the expiry of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Aid Roads Act</inline> 1 969, the Australian Government intends to provide $1,126 million to the States for roads purposes over the next three years. A major new initiative will be the allocation of $400 million of this to meet the full cost of approved construction works and maintenance in relation to national highways, export roads and major commercial roads. $700 million will be allocated for other road projects and a further $26 million for planning and research projects in relation to both roads and urban public transport. </para>
        <para>It is intended that a total of $350 million will be made available in 1 974-75. </para>
          <para>Rail Transport</para>
        <para>The Government recognises the importance of railways in our national transport system. Recently agreement was reached with the South Australian Government for construction of a standard gauge line between Adelaide and Crystal Brook, financed by means of grants and loans to South Australia. Expenditure this year is estimated at $900,000. Agreement has also been reached for the construction by Commonwealth Railways of a standard gauge line that will provide a secure all-weather link between Tarcoola and Alice Springs. Expenditure this year is estimated at $2 million </para>
        <para>In recognition of the costs and problems caused by inadequate railway rolling stock, the Government will be implementing a purchase program by Commonwealth Railways for modern high-performance bogie wagons suitable for inter-system use. These wagons will be available for lease by State railway systems at an agreed rate and will, to some extent, overcome recent shortages of rolling stock experienced by the transport industry. The acquisition program provides for 500 wagons to be ordered this year and 800 next year. </para>
        <para>At the June Premiers&#39; Conference the Prime Minister said that we would be looking to those of our business enterprises which are not paying their way- that is, whose losses are being imposed on the taxpayer- to lift their charges. Accordingly, some increases in Commonwealth Railways passenger fares and freight rates have been made and a thorough examination of the fare and freight rate structure is being undertaken. </para>
          <para>Urban Public Transport</para>
        <para>As part of our program to assist in the upgrading of urban public transport, we will provide almost $28 million towards the cost of new projects in 1974-75. The States will also receive about $39 million in 1974-75 towards the costs of projects approved in 1973-74. A total of $67 million is therefore included in the Budget, out of a total of $138 million which the Government has so far agreed to provide under this program. </para>
        <para>The States Will also be reimbursed for two-thirds of their expenditure in 1973-74 on approved urban public transport research and planning projects. $1 million was recently appropriated for this purpose. The States will be eligible for further assistance for these purposes under the Transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974. </para>
        <para>The Australian Government has made an offer to the New South Wales Government to construct and operate a railway radiating from Parramatta in the western suburbs of Sydney. The New South Wales Government has not yet accepted this offer, but provision has been made in the Budget for an amount of $3.5 million to allow the project to proceed as soon as it does so. </para>
          <para>Shipping and Harbours</para>
        <para>As announced by the Prime Minister, the Australian Government is negotiating with the New South Wales Government for the construction of a large new graving dock at Newcastle. A provision of $3.75 million is being made to cover estimated expenditure in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s policy to increase the share of the nation&#39;s trade carried in Australian flag vessels entails a large capital expenditure program for the Australian National Line. A Budget provision of $54.7 million is being made this year for the ANL compared with $7 million last year. </para>
        <para>The Australian Government provides financial assistance to the Australian Shippers&#39; Council, which negotiates, on behalf of national export and producer bodies, the terms and conditions of carriage in Australia &#39;s outward liner trades. This year, the Government Will increase its financial assistance to a maximum of $90,000, compared with $35,000 last year, on the basis of two dollars for every dollar expended by the Council. </para>
          <para>Pipeline Authority</para>
        <para>An amount of $75 million has been provided for advances to the Pipeline Authority for expenditure on the Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline and spur pipelines. </para>
        <para>WATER SUPPLY</para>
      <para>We are making a start on a program of financial assistance towards the provision of urban water supplies in Adelaide and North West Tasmania; this year the Budget provides $4.4 million to South Australia for the initial phase of a program of construction of water treatment plants in Adelaide. No payments will be required for the North West Tasmania scheme in 1974-75. </para>

          <para>Assistance for Agricultural and Pastoral Industries</para>
        <para>As announced recently by the Minister for Agriculture, the Government has approved the operation by the Australian Wool Corporation during the 1974-75 season of a minimum reserve price equivalent to 250 cents per kilo clean for 2 1 micron wool. The Government has indicated that it is prepared to guarantee repayment of amounts borrowed by the Corporation to finance these operations and the &#34;pot-holing&#34; activities the Corporation will continue to carry on when the market is above the floor. </para>
        <para>The aim of the new arrangement is to provide firm support to the market and give greater confidence to both wool growers and overseas buyers. </para>
        <para>The Government has provided in the Budget for an advance to the Corporation of the $13 million available in the Corporation&#39;s Working Capital Trust Fund. </para>
        <para>I shall also shortly introduce legislation to appropriate funds to enable me to make loans in addition to those provided for in the Budget to the Corporation as they are required. </para>
        <para>The Budget also reflects the arrangements made for an increase in the levy on grower&#39;s returns from sales of wool during 1974-75 to meet any losses from the operation of the floor price scheme. This additional amount, estimated at $44.7 million, will be collected and paid to the Corporation&#39;s Market Support Fund. If no losses are incurred, the contribution will be used for building up reserves. </para>
        <para>In accordance with the present Wheat Industry Stabilisation Scheme, and as a result of buoyant export prices, it is estimated that wheat growers will contribute an amount of $39 million to the Stabilisation Fund in 1974-75 in respect of the 1973-74 pool. </para>
        <para>In accordance with the decision last year to phase out the bounty on butter and cheese production, an amount of $9 million is being provided for the bounty in 1974-75, compared with $18 million in 1973-74. However, increased funds are being provided for dairy industry adjustment through the broadened Marginal Dairy Farms Reconstruction Scheme. The estimated cost in 1974-75 is $11.5 million, as against $1.1 million last year. </para>
        <para>The appropriation for the Rural Reconstruction Scheme in 1974-75 is $30 million. In addition, the fruit growing reconstruction scheme will be extended to 31 December 1975 and a provision of $1.5 million is made for that purpose. </para>
        <para>An amount of $2.6 million is being provided for an apple export guarantee scheme for the 1974 season. This follows agreement with the States of Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland that the Australian Government will meet half the costs of underwriting the returns on apples exported &#34;at risk&#34; during 1974 to the United Kingdom and Europe. </para>
        <para>With the expiry of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act on 31 December 1974 the cost of the bounty in 1974-75 will fall to an estimated $33 million, compared with expenditure of $67 million in 1973-74. </para>
        <para>Subject to the agreement of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, it is proposed to set up an Australian Plague Locust Commission to combat outbreaks of this pest. An amount of $250,000 is being provided in 1974-75 as the Australian Government&#39;s proposed 50 per cent share of the costs of establishing the Commission. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to provide a grant of $3 million towards the cost of a weir at Clare on the Burdekin River; $300,000 will be provided in 1974-75. A grant of up to $120,000 will be provided for restoration of damaged levees along the Proserpine River. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to extend its assistance to the Bundaberg Irrigation Project by a grant of $4.4 million; $2 million will be provided for the project in 1 974-75. </para>
        <para>We propose to provide financial assistance to the States for a two-year Water Quality Assessment Program costing $808,000, to complement the existing program of surface and underground water measurement. The Budget provides $332,000 for this program in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to assist the States with a long-term program of soil conservation. An interim two-year program of financial assistance will be commenced this year. Grants totalling $2.5 million will be provided, of which $500,000 will be made available in 1974-75. </para>

        <para>In furtherance of its policy on legal aid, the Government has established the Australian Legal Aid Office. The establishment of the Office is a major step towards the Government&#39;s objective of ensuring that legal aid is readily and equally available to all citizens. Australian Legal Aid Offices are already operating in the capital cities and certain regional centres, and more will be opened during 1974-75. Meanwhile, the program of grants to supplement existing legal aid schemes will be continued in 1974-75. Total expenditure on legal aid in 1974-75, including for Aboriginals, is estimated at $ 12.4 million. </para>

            <para>-It soon will be. On the basis of that report the Government has decided to introduce a tax on liquefied petroleum gas used in propelling road vehicles, but not on gas used for other purposes. The rate of tax will be set initially at 2 cents a litre-we have even gone metric- which is about 40 per cent of the present rate of duty on motor spirit. Should there be any increase in the rate of duty on motor spirit in future, it is proposed that the tax on liquefied petroleum gas will be increased by an amount equivalent to one-half of that increase. It is not proposed to review this basis for setting the relative rate of tax on liquefied petroleum gas for at least five years and the industry can, therefore, plan on that basis. </para>

          <para class="block">Taxation of Income from Mining </para>
          <para>Several amendments are proposed to the income tax law affecting enterprises engaged in prospecting and mining other than for gold. At present both general and petroleum mining enterprises are able to defer payment of tax for long periods under provisions for the allowance of immediate or accelerated deductions for capital expenditures, including anticipated expenditures. As a result, many highly profitable companies have paid relatively little tax over an extended period. </para>
          <para>Other provisions exempt from tax 20 per cent of income derived from production of certain minerals, including bauxite, copper, nickel and beach sands. There is no justification for this exemption and it will be withdrawn as from 1 July 1974. </para>
          <para>Deductions will not in future be allowable for capital expenditure incurred on company formation and capital raising. Capital expenditure on the development of a mine or well, on the provision of community faculties adjacent to a mine or well, or on the purchase of mining rights or information will be deductible henceforth over the estimated life of the mine or well. Where the estimated life is longer than 25 years the allowance will be one twenty-fifth of the deducted capital expenditure. Capital expenditure on facilities for the transport of minerals will be deductible for income tax purposes over 20 years instead of 10 years. However, in relation to any of those expenditures to be made by 30 June 1976 under contracts already entered into, deductions will continue to be allowable under the present provisions of the law. </para>
          <para>Exploration expenditure incurred by general mining companies in 1974-75 and subsequent income years will be allowable as immediate deductions up to the level of income derived in any year from general mining and associated activities in the same way as petroleum prospecting and mining companies are allowed immediate deductions against income from petroleum for similar expenses. Prospecting and other activities carried out by general mining companies on the continental shelf will be regarded as having been carried out in Australia, consistent with the taxation treatment of petroleum operations carried on at off-shore locations. </para>
        </continue>
          <para>Age Rebate</para>
        <para>As I announced on 5 July 1974, the special age rebate to be allowed in calculating tax payable by aged people for 1974-75 will be set at a basic $ 130. The rebate was introduced as a transitional measure last year, as part of the package of measures associated with the commencement of phasing out of the means test. It has now served its transitional role, but it is being phased out gradually. </para>
          <para>Fringe Benefits</para>
        <para>In practice, it has proved difficult to enforce general provisions of the income tax law on the value of some benefits given to employees in addition to their remuneration. Accordingly, amendments to ensure that certain fringe benefits are properly subject to income tax are proposed to apply as from the 1974-75 income year. </para>
        <para>Deductions will cease to be allowable for expenditures on club dues, yachts and pleasure boats. The minimum assessable value to a taxpayer of the use of a motor vehicle provided by his employer will be determined under a formula to be prescribed in the law. The value for income tax purposes of benefits received by employees under stock option and share purchase schemes entered into after today will be ascertained as at the time of exercise of the options or the transfer of the shares. </para>
          <para>Concessional Deduction for Education Expenses</para>
        <para>The Australian Government&#39;s programs involve substantial increases in direct expenditures on education and there is no longer a case for providing substantial indirect assistance through the taxation system. Accordingly, the amount deductable against 1974-75 income for education or self-education expenses will be reduced from $400 to $ 1 50 for any one student. </para>

          <para>The Government considers that income which an individual receives from property- that is, unearned income- should bear more tax than income from personal exertion. The Australian taxation system did, in fact, tax unearned income at higher rates than income from personal exertion from 1915 to 1953 and a number of other countries tax unearned income at special rates. </para>
          <para>A surcharge will therefore be imposed on property income received by individuals in 1974-75. The surcharge will be 10 per cent of the tax on property income included in the taxable income. This tax will be calculated by applying to property income the average rate payable on total taxable income under the ordinary rate schedule. </para>

        <para>I announced on 23 July 1974 that we would introduce a capital gains tax. Capacity to pay tax is enhanced by capital gains as well as increased income. It has therefore been unfair that income has borne full tax while capital gains have borne none. Taxpayers have also been able to manipulate their transactions so as to substitute capital gains for income and thereby avoid taxation. </para>

            <para>-Well, the right honourable gentleman should not need any telling. He knows. The new tax will apply to capital gains realised after today. However, in relation to property already held, the tax will fall only on gains accruing after today. Today&#39;s values will be taken as one basis of calculation of those gains, but where today&#39;s values are below the cost of acquiring property, the new tax will not apply unless realization value exceeds that cost. </para>

          <para>The new tax will not apply to any amount that qualifies as income for income tax purposes. Particular examples are profits from the sale of property which are subject to income tax under sections 25, 26 (a) and  26AAA  of the Income Tax Assessment Act </para>
          <para>For the benefit of the honourable member for Gippsland, gains on sale of a taxpayer&#39;s principal residence will be exempt from the new tax and there will be other exemptions and reliefs. </para>
          <para>Half of the capital gains realised by an individual in a year will be included in assessable income and taxed at income tax rates. That is, the rate of the capital gains tax levied on individuals will be equivalent to not more than one-half of the marginal tax rate which would have applied had the gain been taxed as income. The gains of companies will bear tax at a rate equal to half the maximum marginal rate of tax on individuals, namely 33V4 per cent. </para>
          <para>It is proposed, however, that full income tax rates, whether for companies or individuals, should apply to one category of capital gains namely that part of gains realised on the sale of land which reflects actual or potential change in use. Gains of this kind accrue from community decisions and the benefits of such decisions should accrue to the community. This aspect of the capital gains tax will have a significant impact in controlling land speculation. </para>
          <para>These are the key features. There are many complex technicalities involved and extensive anti-avoidance provisions will be required. For these reasons it will not be practicable to introduce legislation before the Autumn sittings. Meanwhile, I am circulating an explanatory paper giving a more detailed but still broad outline of what is proposed. </para>
          <para>I come now to the Government&#39;s proposed tax concessions. </para>
          <para>Concessional Deductions for Dependants Residing Overseas</para>
        <para>As announced in the Policy Speech, the income tax law will be amended to enable Aus.tralian residents to claim deductions in 1974-75 and subsequent income years for the maintenance of dependants who are not residing in Australia. </para>
        <para class="block">Depreciation on Child Care Facilities </para>
        <para>As also announced in the Policy Speech, the income tax law will be amended to provide specifically for depreciation deductions in 1974-75 and subsequent income years for capital expenditure by employers on the provision of child care facilities for children of their employees. </para>
          <para>Estate Duty</para>
        <para>Two amendments will also be made to the estate duty law to give effect to undertakings in the Policy Speech. We shall set up a board to hear applications for release from payment of duty in cases of serious hardship, to be composed in the same way as the existing boards that consider similar matters relating to income tax and payroll tax. </para>
        <para>The other amendment will exempt from duty, along lines indicated in the Policy Speech, an interest in a principal matrimonial home that passes to a surviving spouse. Before calculating the statutory exemption from duty the unencumbered value of such an interest up to $35,000 will be excluded from the value of the estate. Where the unencumbered value is more than $35,000 the amount excluded will be $35,000 less $7 for every $10 in excess of $35,000. The amendment will apply to dutiable estates resulting from deaths since 29 April 1974 of persons domiciled in Australia </para>
          <para>Home Mortgage Interest</para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s scheme of income tax deductions for home mortgage interest has already been outlined. The legislation Will be introduced during the present sitting of Parliament and will apply to interest payments since 1 July 1974. </para>
        <para>I come now to the major new taxation concessions proposed by the Government. In aggregate they amount to $500 million in value in a full year </para>
          <para>Broadcast Listeners&#39; and Television Viewers&#39; Licence Fees</para>
        <para>First, I announce that the Government has decided to abolish broadcast listeners&#39; and television viewers&#39; licence fees. The National Broadcasting and Television Service is a service provided to the community as a whole, and the Government believes that the cost of the service should therefore be met out of general taxation revenues rather than through a licence fee which, being a poll tax, bears relatively more heavily on the less affluent. </para>
        <para>Licences which become due for renewal on or after tomorrow, 18 September 1974, need not be renewed. </para>
        <para>There will be a full-year saving to listeners and viewers of $71 million. </para>

              <para>- There are so many good things that one has to tell the lot. The revised scale will be reflected in Paye deductions as from 1 November 1974. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In addition to the reductions in tax on low incomes in general under the new rate scale, we see a particular need for tax relief to low income families. A special rebate of tax will be introduced for that purpose. If a taxpayer&#39;s saving of tax at ordinary rates from his dependants maintenance deductions would be less than 40 per cent of the amount of those deductions, a rebate of tax will be given to bring the tax saving up to 40 per cent or up to the tax otherwise payable if that is less. In some cases the rebate will extinguish tax altogether and the savings in some cases will be as high as $5 or $6 a week. Where this does not happen, it will be greater the lower the income of the taxpayer and the larger his dependants deductions. Taxpayers who would already be saving 40 per cent or more of their dependants deductions will not benefit. </para>
          <para>The rebate will be reflected in P A Ye deductions as from 1 November 1974. A separate statement explains it further. </para>
          <para>The total cost to revenue of the restructuring of the rate scale and the special rebate for low income families is of the order of $430 million on a full-year basis. </para>
          <para>The combined effect of these two measures will be to cut dramatically the tax payable by those on lower incomes with dependants. For example, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two dependent children and with average other deductions earning $70 a week paid $213 in tax on 1973-74 income; on 1974-75 income no tax will be payable. If he earns $90 per week the tax payable will be cut by more than half, from $389 per annum to $190. At $120 a week the gains remain significant, tax payable falling from $739 per annum to $577. </para>
          <para>Taken together, our tax measures constitute major reforms. They will make the tax system fairer and more equitable. The great majority of wage and salary earners, and especially low income single-income families, will pay less tax as a result. </para>
          <para>Revenue Totals</para>
        <para>The cost to revenue of the restructuring of the income tax rate scale, the special rebate for low income families and the abolition of broadcast listeners&#39; and television viewers&#39; licence fees is, as I have said, about $500 million on a full-year basis. Some part of that cost will reflect itself in refunds of personal income tax in early 1 975-76. </para>
        <para>The net cost to revenue of the general revenue measures I have announced- that is, excluding the proceeds from the proposed increase in the wool levy-is about $237 million in 1974-75. Details, including the revenue estimates for each of the separate decisions, are given in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>After allowance for the decisions we have taken, it is estimated that receipts will be $ 1 5,704 million in 1974-75. This would be an increase of $3,702 million, or 30.8 per cent, over the 1973-74 level. </para>
        <para>BUDGET OUTCOME</para>
      <para>I now summarise the Budget aggregates. </para>
      <para>Budget outlays are estimated to increase by $3,980 million, or 32.4 per cent, to $16,274 million in 1974-75. Budget receipts are estimated to rise by $3,702 million, or 30.8 per cent, to $15,704 million. </para>
      <para>The estimated deficit is thus $570 million but in respect of the domestic balance there is an estimated domestic surplus of $23 million. Those estimates compare with the deficit of $293 million and the domestic surplus of $2 1 1 million in 1973-74. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>The keynote of this Budget is social progress. We are looking to create a fairer and better Australia. </para>
      <para>The year ahead will be a difficult one. The world is beset by severe economic problems. </para>
      <para class="block">Australia cannot insulate itself from them nor can it be saved by the beatings of previous Treasurers. </para>
      <para>The Budget, together with our other policies, is designed to make the best of things as they are in the world today- to maintain employment opportunities and to protect those who most need protection from the ravages of inflation. At the same time we are looking to the longer term to the way Australia develops as a nation in the decades ahead. The problems immediately ahead have to be dealt with but in doing so this Government will remain steadfast in implementing its programs. </para>

        <para>Budget Aggregates</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The broad aggregates of the 1974-75 Budget, together with comparable data for 1973-74, are shown in national accounts form in the following table: </para>

          <graphic href="090131197009173_58_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>The main points that emerge from the Budget aggregates are: o <inline font-style="italic">Budget</inline> outlays are estimated to increase by 32.4 per cent in 1974-75, considerably faster than the increase of 20.2 per cent in 1973-74; o after taking account of the net effect of the revenue measures proposed <inline font-style="italic">Budget receipts</inline> are estimated to increase by 30.8 per cent in 1974-75; o <inline font-style="italic">the estimated overall deficit</inline> of $570 million is about $278 million greater than in the previous year - the estimated <inline font-style="italic">domestic surplus</inline> of $23 million is smaller, by about $189 million, than in 1973-74; o this estimated net outcome is heavily influenced by the effect of inflation on revenue and comparisons with past deficits have limited significance for purposes of economic analysis; o the last point can be illustrated by pointing out that should inflation be less severe than assumed in calculating the revenue estimates, the deficit will be larger, yet it would be meaningless to suggest that that outcome implied that the larger deficit had added to inflation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The difference between the total deficit and the domestic surplus figures shown in the preceding table is attributable primarily to the fact that there is sizeable expenditure overseas from the Budget each year. It should be noted that the immediate effects of overseas outlays are on the balance of payments - they do not add directly to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. Estimated movements in domestic and overseas outlays in 1974-75, compared with the actual increases in 1973-74, are shown in the table below: </para>

Within domestic outlays, increases in government direct expenditures on goods and services are reflected in full in the level of aggregate demand, while the impact of transfers and advances on domestic activity depends on the spending propensities of the income recipients. The various recipients of different types of advances and transfers are also, of course, likely to have different spending patterns. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The 1974-75 Budget has been framed in an unusually difficult economic context. Unemployment and prices are rising and the balance of payments is deteriorating. While there is always a degree of uncertainty about economic prospects, in present circumstances the outlook is <inline font-style="italic">especially</inline> uncertain. The policy options chosen in framing the Budget reflect Government objectives, both as regards social and economic policies, and the Government&#39;s judgment as to how the overall economic situation will develop. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">This Statement is devoted to describing the economic context in which the Budget has been framed and to considering the prospects for the economy in 1974-75 as they presently appear. </para>
      <para class="italic">
        <inline font-style="italic">Review of Developments in 1973-74</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">For most of 1973-74 the economy, while growing strongly, was subjected to exceptional strains including shortages of goods and materials, extremely tight labour market conditions and severe inflationary pressures. During the year monetary, tariff and exchange rate policies were directed towards relieving those strains. By the closing months of 1973-74 signs were appearing that excessive demand pressures were abating. Developments in early 1974-75 confirmed this trend; in some industries demand pressures were easing quite rapidly. Cost pressures, however, remained intense. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In constant price terms, total spending on goods and services in 1973-74 increased more than twice as fast as domestic production. This was in marked contrast to 1972-73, when increases in expenditures and output were both much smaller and of roughly the same order. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Changes in the major national accounting aggregates at constant prices in 1972-73 and 1973-74 are shown in the following table. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="090131197009173_62_6.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Private sector spending rose more rapidly than public sector spending in 1973-74. This reflected a greater measure of success by the private sector in competing for available resources rather than any deficiency of public sector demand. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">With household disposable income rising by over 20 per cent in 1973-74, private <inline font-style="italic">consumer</inline> demand remained strong throughout the year, although shortages constrained growth in actual spending to some extent. Reflecting a massive infusion of finance in 1972-73, the <inline font-style="italic">dwelling</inline> construction industry remained severely over-stretched throughout 1973-74 and prices of houses soared. A fall in lending for housing from those inflated levels, however, began to have its effects towards the end of 1973-74. While the number of dwellings under construction at the end of the year was at a record level it was clear that, with approvals falling off steadily, the situation in the industry was changing. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Business fixed investment</inline>in 1973-74 was 12.3 per cent higher than in 1972-73. Capital spending recovered strongly in the first half of the year but the recovery did not persist. A substantial increase in investment had been expected by businesses in the second half of 1973-74 but this was not realised. Shortages of labour, materials, and equipment imposed some initial restraints on investment programs but, more recently, uncertainty as to future prospects, both as regards demand and inflation, appears to have led to such programs being reduced or deferred. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Strong demand coupled with supply problems restrained <inline font-style="italic">non-farm stock accumulation</inline> until the second half of 1973-74 when stocks increased sharply. Much of this increase is thought to have reflected a build up in stocks of imported goods. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Public sector</inline>spending, in constant price terms, rose moderately during 1973-74. Administrative and resource constraints - particularly in respect of capital spending in the first half of the year - resulted in delays and underspending on some programs. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">After four years in which <inline font-style="italic">exports</inline> ran ahead of <inline font-style="italic">imports,</inline> the pattern was substantially reversed during 1973-74. This turnaround in the impact of the external sector - from a net drain on Australian resources to a net contribution to supplies - reflected both the strains on the domestic economy and the action taken through exchange rate adjustments and tariff reductions to increase supplies of imported goods. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Exports</inline>of goods and services increased by 13 per cent in current price terms in 1973-74 but the volume of exports declined by about 5 per cent <inline font-style="italic">Imports</inline> of goods and services grew by 44 per cent in value terms and by about 30 per cent in volume terms. The balance on current account changed from a surplus of $665 million in 1972-73 to a deficit of $707 million in 1973-74. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the year to June 1974, the number of persons in civilian employment increased by 218,000 or 4.7 per cent. The intense demand for labour resulted in a particularly strong rise in female participation in the labour force, with female employment increasing by 126,000 or 7.7 per cent and male employment by 92,000 or 3.0 per cent. </para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">As these figures indicate, the labour market was at full stretch throughout most of 1973- 74 but showed signs of easing towards the end of the year. In the early part of 1974- 75 there was a sharp intensification of this tendency, with a marked rise in unemployment. In seasonally adjusted terms persons registered as unemployed (excluding school leavers) increased in number from 71,000 to 111,000 between end-June and end-August. Registered vacancies at the end of August totalled 48,200, seasonally adjusted, having fallen from a peak of 92,000 in March 1974. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Wage and price increases gathered pace over the course of the year. In the June quarter the Consumer Price Index rose by 4.1 per cent while average weekly earnings per employed male unit jumped by 6.0 per cent. The acceleration in prices and earnings during 1973-74 is reflected in the following table: </para>

      </para>
      <para>The Outlook for 1974-75</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1974-75 Budget has been framed against the background of a slow-down in economic activity but continuing rapid increases in prices. As the year began there were signs of slack developing in some sectors of the economy. With little abatement of wage claims seemingly in sight, expectations of a further acceleration in prices remain widely held. That and other factors, notably the outlook for profits, appear to be leading to uncertainty and hesitancy, especially in respect of business investment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given inflationary expectations and easing demand pressures the economic prospects for 1974-75 are more than usually uncertain. The course of many key indicators - including consumer spending, business investment and employment - will be particularly sensitive to trends in prices and wages. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is clear, however, that the pace of economic activity in 1974-75 will be much more subdued than it was in 1973-74. Seasonal conditions have been generally favourable to date and should these hold relatively strong growth in farm output can be expected in the current year. But only very moderate growth is likely in non-farm production. At this time gross non-farm domestic product at constant prices seems likely to increase by about 2 per cent in 1974-75, reflecting employment growth of about 2 per cent and little or no growth in productivity. Over much of the year aggregate demand is expected to be relatively weak and the level of unemployment is expected to increase. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The above estimates reflect year-on-year comparisons. The pattern of growth <inline font-style="italic">during</inline> the year is expected to be uneven, with a slight downturn in gross non-farm domestic product in the current half-year followed by a return towards a more normal rate of growth in the second half of the year. The resumption of stronger growth in the second half year is expected as a result of the expansionary influence of the Budget, and of the working off of stocks, including imports. The uncertainties, especially in respect of the latter element in the situation, should, however, be noted </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Conditions in 1973-74 were clearly exceptional. Output and employment both expanded at unsustainable high rates but the growth in domestic supplies still fell well short of the growth in demand. In 1973-74 the extraordinary growth in imports permitted gross national expenditure to grow more than twice as fast as gross domestic product These same demand pressures on the economy will not operate in 1974-75 when the growth in gross national expenditure is likely to be similar to that in gross domestic product. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The prospects for each of the main components of demand are not, of course, uniform. Personal consumption expenditure, which forms about 60 per cent of total final expenditure, is likely to grow more slowly than in 1973-74. The large increase in average weekly earnings, together with substantial rises in social security benefits and the personal taxation measures included in the Budget, will make moderate growth possible, despite slow employment growth and the likelihood of a substantial decline in farm income from the record 1973-74 level. The demand for consumer durables (including motor vehicles) is likely to be constrained to some extent while consumer credit restraint continues. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">What happens to private investment in 1974-75 will depend importantly on businessmen&#39;s own assessment of the economic outlook. On present indications - and especially given business pessimism about the trend in costs and profits - fixed investment by businesses seems likely to decline in 1974-75 after the recovery last year. Stock movements are difficult to predict in present circumstances but further substantial - and largely unplanned - increases in stocks could occur in the current half year before adjustments are effected in the first half of 1975. Spending on new dwellings is also likely to ease back from the admittedly excessive level of 1973-74. This, however, will be cushioned by action already taken to increase the flow of funds to public housing authorities and through the savings banks. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The demand for goods and services by the public sector appears likely to be the strongest component of domestic demand in 1974-75. Very strong growth is expected in both current and capital expenditure, and at all levels of government. Spending by the Australian Government seems certain to be particularly strong. As the previous observations will have indicated, government programs in 1974-75 are not expected to be inhibited by serious resource shortages of the sort experienced in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Export prospects at this time are particularly uncertain. Little real growth is expected in the economies of our major trading partners in 1974-75. The current year should see a recovery in the volume of exports but the outlook for prices is in many respects uncertain. Following exceptionally rapid growth during 1973-74, the volume of imports seems likely to remain high in the current half year before falling away in the first half of 1975. In current price terms, imports of goods and services are expected to rise significantly more than exports, in which case the current account of the balance of payments would record a substantial deficit in 1974-75. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">This Statement presents detailed estimates of Budget outlays in 1974-75. It is based on the <inline font-style="italic">functional classification</inline> of Budget outlays which was introduced in last year&#39;s Budget documents. There are, however, some modifications; these include the splitting of the &#39;Housing and Community Amenities nec&#39; function into two separate functions, &#39;Housing&#39; and &#39;Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment&#39; and the abolition of the &#39;Immigration&#39; function, outlays under which have now been transferred to other appropriate functional headings. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget outlays in 1974-75 are estimated at $16,274 million, an increase of $3,980 million or 32.4 per cent over actual outlays in 1973-74. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence in 1974-75 are estimated at $1,498.7 million, an increase of 12.3 per cent on outlays in 1973-74. This compares with an increase of 8.2 per cent in 1973-74. Estimated outlays on defence in 1974-75 represent 9.2 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays; the corresponding figure in 1973-74 was 10.9 per cent. </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
        <item label="(a)">
          <para>Because of an accounting change the costs of rations and fuel are included in the estimate for supporting equipment and stores for 1974-75 rather than in general administrative expenditure. </para>
        </item>
      </list>
        <para>Manpower Costs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision has been made for an increase of $71 million in manpower costs in 1974-75. The main reasons for the increase are the full-year effect of awards and determinations made in 1973-74 and the planned build-up in Army strength. These increases will be offset in part by some reduction in strengths of civilian staffs. Manpower costs account for 59 per cent of estimated total defence outlays in 1974-75 compared with 61 per cent of actual defence outlays in 1973-74. </para>
        <para>Defence Equipment and Stores</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores are designed to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, etc.) is adequate to meet likely contingencies. Outlays on such equipment in 1974-75 are estimated at $91.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million, and relate mainly to projects already committed including two new Oberon submarines, an Oceanographic Ship and ten Sea King Helicopters for the Navy, Light Observation Helicopters for the Army and twelve Medium Lift Helicopters and thirty-seven CT4 Trainer Aircraft for the RAAF. Provision has also been made for initial payments on the new major equipment projects announced by the Minister for Defence in March 1974 - Destroyers, Tanks and Fire Support Vehicles, and Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft - and for other equipment, details of which will be announced by the Minister. Expenditure on supporting equipment in 1974-75 is estimated at $135.1 million, an increase of $25.9 million over 1973-74. About $14 million of this increase is due to a reallocation of costings from General Administrative Expenditure. Cost increases, particularly for fuel, are a dominant factor in the remaining increase of $12 million. Outlays on repairs and maintenance are expected to increase by $9.5 million, or nearly 22 per cent, in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>Defence Facilities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading is to provide and maintain capital facilities including adequate living and working accommodation for personnel. Advances to the States for the provision of housing for servicemen and their families are estimated to total $16.1 million, or more than double the amount spent in 1973-74. The more significant of the other buildings and works items are the continuation of construction of the Naval Support Facility at Cockburn Sound (W.A.) and the upgrading of facilities at the Royal Australian Transport Corps Centre, Puckapunyal (Vic), Williamstown Dockyard (Vic.) and Canungra Jungle Training Centre (Qld.). Expenditure on these and other projects is expected to total $53.1 million in 1974-75, $9.4 million more than in 1973-74. Provision of $14.0 million has been made for the acquisition of an office building in Melbourne to improve the present inadequate accommodation of defence staff and to establish a single Defence Office in that city consequent upon the amalgamation of the former Service Departments and Defence. </para>
        <para>Industrial Capacity</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main reasons for the expected increase of $8.1 million under this heading are higher wages costs in Government defence factories. These will increase the cost of maintaining reserve production capacity, and have made necessary the provision of additional working capital, mainly for the NOMAD aircraft project, to support the operations of the factories. </para>
        <para>Research and Development Establishments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on research and development is aimed at assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in military technology and at developing weapons systems for Australia&#39;s defence needs. The estimated increase of $7.6 million to $67.5 million reflects mainly wage and other cost increases. </para>
        <para class="block">Defence Co-operation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Through defence co-operation the Government aims to help friendly countries in the region of immediate interest to Australia to strengthen their own, and the region&#39;s, capacity for defence. The estimated outlay of $24.5 million in 1974-75 includes $11.9 million for continuing assistance previously committed under three-year programs to Indonesia (a $20 million program) and to Malaysia and Singapore (programs of $16 million and $4 million respectively, which had not been fully expended by the due completion date of 30 June 1974 and which are being extended by the addition of $2.2 million to cover training and exercises). Military training assistance in Australia will continue to be provided on a small scale to some other countries, including Thailand and Fiji. New budgetary arrangements for providing financial assistance to Papua New Guinea for defence are being introduced from 1 December 1974. An amount of $12.5 million is being provided to cover requirements from 1 December 1974 to 30 June 1975. Previously all defence expenditure in Papua New Guinea was appropriated under other headings within the defence function. </para>
        <para>Storage and Transport Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this category are removal and storage costs associated with the transfer of government employees, including servicemen, and the costs of operating Australian Government transport pools. Salary and wage determinations granted during 1973-74 are primarily responsible for the estimated increase of $3.2 million in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>General Administrative Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This broad category of expenditure covers a wide range of items including travel, office requisites, postage and telephone services, light, power, and water supplies, freight and cartage, compensation payments, and medical and dental services provided by civilian authorities. </para>
        <para>Natural Disasters, Civil Defence and Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this category are outlays on natural disasters, civil defence, war graves and various miscellaneous items. </para>
        <para>Overseas Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in the estimated outlay of $1,498.7 million on defence in 1974-75 is provision for expenditure overseas amounting to $145.7 million, or $7.7 million more than in 1973-74. This estimate of expenditure overseas includes provision for payments in respect of the F111C and other aircraft, helicopters and submarines, and on maintenance of defence forces overseas; it does not include defence expenditure in Papua New Guinea or any overseas component of the remaining $12.0 million planned to be expended on defence co-operation for overseas countries. </para>

          </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">Education remains a high priority area for the Government and several important new initiatives to be undertaken in 1974-75 are outlined in the Budget Speech. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays by the Australian Government on education in 1974-75 will continue to rise rapidly because of new initiatives and the full-year effect of new policies introduced during 1973-74. In 1974-75 total outlays on education are estimated at $1,534.7 million, 78 per cent higher than outlays on education in 1973-74 and equivalent to 9.4 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As the following table shows, the prospective increase is spread over all levels of education. </para>
        <para>Tertiary and Technical Education</para>
        <para>Universities, Colleges of Advanced Education and Teachers Colleges</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Large increases are expected in 1974-75 in expenditure on education in universities, colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges. Expenditure on university education is estimated at $472.3 million in 1974-75, an increase of $140.8 million, while expenditure on the various colleges is estimated to increase by $127.2 million to $320.0 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The fiscal year 1974-75 will be the first full year in which the Australian Government has full financial responsibility for universities and colleges. The large increases in outlays in part reflect the fact that prior to January 1974 grants were provided to the States for universities and colleges of advanced education and teachers and preschool teachers colleges on a matching basis. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The States agreed that appropriate offsets, to take account of payments that they would no longer have to make to their tertiary institutions, would be made in the general purpose funds provided by the Australian Government to the States. (Details of these offsets are provided in Chapters II and III of <inline font-style="italic">Payments To or For The States and Local Government Authorities 1974-75).</inline> Other initiatives that were introduced in this area as from the beginning of 1974 were the abolition of fees in tertiary and technical education institutions and new student assistance measures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From January 1975 living allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will be increased and the means test relaxed to allow for movements in salaries and wages. This scheme, introduced by the Government in January 1974, provides non-competitive means-tested allowances to full-time non-bonded Australian students admitted to approved courses in tertiary and approved post-secondary institutions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The cost of the scheme for university and college students is estimated at $63.0 million in 1974-75, an increase of $35.1 million on outlays in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There will also be increases from January 1975 in allowances payable under the Postgraduate Awards Scheme (included in &#39;student assistance&#39; for &#39;Universities&#39;) and the Pre-School Teacher Education Allowances Scheme (included in &#39;student assistance&#39; for colleges of Advanced Education and Teachers Colleges&#39;). Outlays in 1974-75 are estimated at $8.4 million and $2.3 million respectively. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase in &#39;other advanced education&#39; is attributable to the fact that 1974-75 will be the first full year of operation of the Film and Television School; a provision has been made for expenditure of $2.8 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates for 1974-75 also reflect, for the first time, a further significant undertaking by the Australian Government in this area, namely the supplementing, as from 1974, of approved triennial programs of financial assistance to universities and the colleges to allow for wage, salary and other cost increases above the levels provided for when the original triennial programs were determined. An amount of $39.2 million to allow for retrospective cost increases has been incorporated in the grants for these institutions and $25.4 million has been allowed for further estimated adjustments of recurrent grants during 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of the Australian Government&#39;s programs of financial assistance for past triennia and for the current triennium (1973-75) for universities, colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges are included in Chapter IV of <inline font-style="italic">Payments To or For The States and Local Government Authorities, 1974-75.</inline></para>
        <para>Technical Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In April 1973 the Australian Government established the Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education to make recommendations on financial assistance to the States for these forms of education from 1 July 1974. The Committee&#39;s Report was submitted in April 1974 and the Government has endorsed the general principles underlying its recommendations. The Government has decided on a $96.5 million program of assistance to the States over the two financial years 1974-75 and 1975-76 to enhance the quality and extend the availability of technical and further education, on the understanding that the States will not reduce the level of their own activities in technical education. The amount to be provided to the States in 1974-75 is $49.1 million. The Government also proposes to establish a permanent Commission on Technical and Further Education as a successor to the Committee. In addition, the Government has approved a capital program of $3.5 million for technical education in the A.C.T. over the two financial years 1974-75 and 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Prior to July 1974 assistance to the States for technical education had been made by way of unmatched grants; $28.6 million was provided in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase of $8.2 million in outlays in 1974-75 for student assistance at technical institutions reflects the full-year costs of the introduction from January 1974 and the increased assistance to apply from January 1975 of the Tertiary Allowance Assistance Scheme. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government decided to reimburse the States in 1973-74 for fee revenue forgone as a consequence of the Government&#39;s decision to abolish fees at technical training institutions from 1 January 1974. The <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Technical Training Fees Re-imbursement) Act</inline> 1973 provided $10.3 million for this purpose for the six months January to June 1974. </para>

        <para>Schools</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays by the Australian Government on schools reflect initiatives taken over the years to provide financial assistance to the States for certain specific activities of both government and non-government schools. It also includes, as from 1974, substantially increased measures of financial assistance approved by the Australian Government for the two years 1974 and 1975 on the basis of the recommendations of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission. Estimated outlays for 1974-75 include the first full-year effect of these latter measures which were incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Schools) Act</inline> 1973. Outlays in 1974-75 under this Act have been increased by the Government&#39;s decision to escalate the approved levels of financial assistance, as from mid-1974, to allow for cost increases above the levels provided for when the original programs were determined. The estimated total amount involved is $48.5 million, including $1.5 million for the school library and science development programs referred to below. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Interim Committee has now been replaced by a continuing statutory authority, the Schools Commission. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The first grants to the States, for government and non-government schools, arising out of the recommendations of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission, were paid from the beginning of 1974.

        <para pgwide="yes">The Schools Committee&#39;s program includes grants for general recurrent purposes at government and non-government schools, for new and upgraded buildings, for libraries, &#39;disadvantaged&#39; schools, handicapped children, teacher development, special projects and information systems. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Earlier legislation, the <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Schools) Act</inline> 1972-73, provides for capital assistance for both government and non-government primary and secondary schools in the States by way of unmatched grants over the five-year period commencing 1 July 1973. In 1974-75 these grants will continue to run their course in parallel with the Interim Committee&#39;s program. The capital grants available in 1974-75 for government and non-government schools under the <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Schools) Act</inline> 1972-73 are estimated to total $38 million. </para>

An amount of $10.0 million was included in the 1973-74 Budget in advance of the report and recommendations of the Committee so that a start could be made on the program as early as possible in 1974. Separate expenditure was incurred under the <inline font-style="italic">Child Care Act</inline> 1972 to assist in the construction and operation of child care centres. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Committee presented its Report in November 1973 and the Government invited comments from interested bodies and asked the Social Welfare Commission, in collaboration with the Pre-schools Committee, the Priorities Review Staff and other government agencies to consider the development of pre-school and child care facilities from the welfare standpoint. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After considering the reports, the Government has now decided to provide $75 million in 1974-75 to enable a start to be made, no later than 1 January 1975, on a new program for the care and education of young children, and to meet commitments under the existing program. The new program involves a fully integrated approach to the needs of childhood, embracing education, health and care services. An Interim Children&#39;s Committee is to be established, pending the establishment of a Children&#39;s Commission, to assume responsibility for administering all existing commitments and for developing the new program. </para>

Age pensions are payable, subject to a means test on income and property, to residentially qualified women aged 60 to 74 years and to residentially qualified men aged 65 to 74 years. To be residentially qualified for age pension, a period of ten years continuous residence in Australia is usually necessary. </para>

The special tax rebate arrangement, introduced in 1973-74 as a transitional measure to ensure that, generally, pensioners were not made worse off as a consequence of the taxation of pensions, will begin to be phased out. For the 1974-75 income year the transitional age rebate will be reduced from $156 to $130. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The existing and proposed maximum rates of the above benefits are set out below. Because of the effect of inflation on pensions and the lateness of the Budget this year, the standard and married rates of pension were increased early in August 1974. The standard (or single) rate was increased by $5.00 a week and the married rate by $3.00 a week. The rates of pension will be further reviewed in Autumn 1975. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated cost of the proposed increases in benefits is $6.2 million in 1974-75 and $7.8 million in a full year. The estimated cost of abolition, as from 1 April 1975, of the means test for residentially qualified men and women aged 70 to 74 years is $25 million in 1974-75 or about $100 million in a full year. </para>

The main factors contributing to this increase are the abolition of the means test for persons aged 75 years or more announced in last year&#39;s Budget, normal&#39; growth, and the fact that about 53,500 persons are estimated to become age pensioners as a result of abolition of the means test for residentially qualified men and women aged 70 to 74 years from the Autumn of 1975. </para>

The main reasons for this are the recent increases in pension rates, the full-year effects of increased rates of pension introduced during 1973-74 and the abolition of the means test for residentially qualified men and women aged 75 years and over, and the proposed abolition of the means test for residentially qualified men and women aged 70 to 74 years from Autumn 1975. </para>

It is proposed to widen the scope of the Act so that handicapped adults may be accommodated in subsidised homes. It is also proposed that grants be made on a $4 for $1 basis instead of on a $2 for $1 basis. The Government pays a personal care subsidy to eligible organisations for persons aged 80 years or over and other residents who require, and are receiving, approved personal care while living in hostel-type accommodation provided by those organisations. It is proposed to increase the rate of subsidy from $12 a week to $15 a week. </para>

In addition, members of the Regular Defence Force who have had at least three years service terminating on or after 7 December 1972, or a lesser period if discharged on medical grounds, may also be eligible for repatriation pensions if the incapacity or death resulted from that service. Dependants of deceased servicemen may also qualify for benefit. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For ex-servicemen, basic eligibility varies according to the nature of service. Broadly, for those with &#39;active service&#39;, incapacity or death resulting from &#39;any occurrence&#39; during war service may be accepted.

        <para pgwide="yes">Ex-Servicemen: pensions are paid to eligible ex-servicemen in three main categories: o The Special Rate (known as the T &#38; PI) Pension, payable to an ex-serviceman who, as a result of war service, is blinded, or is totally and permanently incapacitated so that he is unable to earn more than a negligible percentage of a living wage. o The Intermediate Rate, payable to an ex-serviceman who, because of the severity of his incapacity accepted as related to war service, can work only part-time or intermittently, and in consequence cannot earn a living wage. o The General Rate, payable to an ex-serviceman who has an incapacity accepted as related to war service, but is not because of that incapacity prevented from being able to work full-time. The amounts payable range from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of the maximum general rate, according to the assessed degree of incapacity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Dependants of ex-servicemen: pensions are also paid to the wives of incapacitated ex-servicemen and to dependant children. Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular ex-serviceman&#39;s incapacity. When the death of an ex-serviceman has been accepted as related to his war service, his widow qualifies for the war widows rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children receive pensions at &#39;orphan&#39; rates and other benefits. If an ex-serviceman&#39;s death has not been accepted as related to war service, but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at one of the special rates or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as due to war service. Other dependants of deceased ex-servicemen may qualify for pensions in certain cases. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The diminishing level of outlays on the Snowy Mountains Scheme over recent years reflects progress towards completion of the Scheme by 30 June 1977. The proposed payment of $5.9 million to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority in 1974-75 comprises $5.1 million in respect of its capital works program (to provide facilities for permanent operation and maintenance and the clean-up of work sites) and an amount of $890,000 for a further payment by the Authority to the River Murray Commission, reimbursing half of the cost of increasing the capacity of the Hume Weir to cater for the diversion of Snowy River waters to the River Murray. An initial payment of $3.7 million was made to the Commision in 1973-74. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government is providing financial assistance to the Queensland Government, by way of loans, to help finance the construction of a thermal power station at Gladstone in central Queensland. Assistance provided by the Australian Government for the project is proportionate to the total cost of the power station in the ratio of 80 to 155. Payments of $14.0 million and $26.6 million were made in 1972-73 and 1973-74 and it is estimated that a further $32.0 million will be made available in 1974-75. </para>

        <para font-style="bold">INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government assists industry through a variety of measures, including direct financial assistance, taxation concessions, guaranteed home price arrangements, financial guarantees and the customs tariff. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Direct assistance provided to industry from the Budget is estimated at $573.4 million in 1974-75, an increase of $89.5 million compared with actual outlays for 1973-74. However, this increase would be more than offset by the estimated increase in industry levies and charges such as the wool tax, wheat export charge, and meat export charge; details are shown in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Direct industry assistance takes the form of bounties and subsidies, reconstruction schemes, contributions to research and promotion programs, and other payments to or for the benefit of industry. It includes also some outlays by Government departments and instrumentalities (e.g. Department of Overseas Trade, Department of Manufacturing Industry, Department of Agriculture and the Australian Tourist Commission) ; such organisations provide many services either free of charge or at prices which do not fully recover the costs incurred. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Apart from these direct outlays from the Budget, substantial additional assistance has, as noted above, been provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Government revenues, are as much a call on the Budget as direct outlays. The amount of revenue forgone in 1973-74 through the main taxation concessions for which data are available is estimated to have been S3 14 million. Further information relating to these taxation concessions is provided at the end of the commentary on this sub-function. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays under some other functional headings in this Statement also assist industry.

        <para class="block">Industry Assistance Through the Taxation System </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As mentioned earlier in this Statement, a considerable amount of assistance to industry has been provided in the past through special taxation concessions. Some of these concessions were withdrawn during 1972-73 and others were withdrawn or modified in 1973-74. As indicated in the Budget Speech, legislation is to be introduced withdrawing or reducing certain others. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Such concessions result in a reduction of Australian Government revenues (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients). They are, in fact, as much a call on the Budget as equivalent direct outlays would be, and for this reason have sometimes been described as disguised expenditures. Assistance of this type through the taxation system has been provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their assessable income additional to those authorised under the general provisions of the income tax law. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1973-74 through the main taxation concessions is estimated to have been about $314 million. Details are shown below. (Pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme in respect of exports in 1970-71 and prior years are included under the heading Manufacturing Industry.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A those allowing the deduction of larger amounts than are authorised under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which gives a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deductions from income for this expenditure); </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">B those allowing certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and </para>
        <para>C those exempting certain classes of income. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main provisions in each of these classes and the estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1973-74 are shown in the following table. A miscellany of lesser provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly &#39;Industry Assistance&#39;. These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; drought bonds; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees&#39; amenities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. Taxpayers to whom these provisions apply are assessed on their taxable income for the current year at rates of tax corresponding to the average of their incomes for the current year and the proceeding four years. One effect of the provisions, which is an intended effect, is to ensure that <inline font-style="italic">fluctuations</inline> in income in conjunction with progression  in rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but non fluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward trend in incomes over a number of years and, even if there are fluctuations in income superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions can result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over a period of years are comparable. </para>

While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on the Government&#39;s labour and employment programs is expected to total $150 million in 1974-75, an increase of $34.8 million on the previous year. Introduction of the National Employment and Training System from 1 October 1974 and increased apprenticeship training assistance account for $20.9 million of the increase. The remainder is largely due to the full-year effects of salary and allowance determinations and growth in departmental activity ($10 million) and to support for trade union training ($2.9 million). The Government&#39;s decision to reduce assisted migration to 40,000 settlers within an overall immigration program of 80,000 has reduced the net cost of assisted migration in 1974-75. </para>

        <para>Payment to Stevedoring Industry Authority</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This payment represents collections by the Government on behalf of the Authority in respect of man-hour levies imposed on stevedoring employers under the <inline font-style="italic">Stevedoring Industry Charge Act</inline> 1947-1973. The funds are utilised by the Authority to pay attendance money and leave benefits to waterside workers, and to reimburse employers for pension and redundancy payments. Expenditure in 1974-75 is estimated at $21.3 million, an increase of $1.4 million over expenditure in 1973-74. </para>
        <para>Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Long service leave benefits for coal miners are financed from a Trust Fund established under the <inline font-style="italic">States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act</inline> 1949-1968. In States where miners have been awarded long service leave the States reimburse employers the cost of granting this leave. The Australian Government in turn reimburses the States from an excise imposed on the production of coal. The excise is estimated to yield $2.7 million in 1974-75 and this amount has been provided for payments to the Trust Fund. Expenditure from the Trust Fund in 1974-75 is estimated to be $3.2 million. </para>
        <para>Trade Union Training</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A program of trade union training under the direction of National and State Councils, including the establishment of a national trade union college and State trade union training centres, will be financially supported by the Australian Government. Legislation is expected to be introduced in the Budget Session of Parliament. A provision of $3.0 million has been made for 1974-75. </para>
        <para>Apprenticeship Training</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme, introduced in January 1973, is to increase the available number of apprenticeships and to improve the standard of training. Under the scheme, incentives are provided to employers by way of subsidies for apprenticeship wages and to enable off-the-job training to be undertaken. Allowances are available to first-year and some second-year apprentices living away from home. Expenditure on apprenticeship training has increased sharply since 1972-73 and is reflected in the fact that the number of apprentices rose by 21 per cent in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government has decided to raise the wages subsidy paid to employers of apprentices from $260 a year for each apprentice employed by metropolitan employers and $454 a year for country employers, to $460 a year for both categories of employers. The subsidy for off-the-job training for each apprentice will be raised from $16 to $20 a week. Weekly living-away-from-home allowances for first-year apprentices will be increased from $10 to $12.60 and the rate of $5 at present applying to second-year apprentices under five-year apprenticeships will be paid to all second year apprentices living away from home. In addition, the Government has decided to pay the wage costs of up to 500 apprentices taken on by State Governments, but surplus to their actual requirements in 1974-75. A scheme whereby apprentices will be trained up to the completion of their first or second year within the industrial establishments of the Australian Government Department of Manufacturing Industry and will then complete their apprenticeships with private industry will also be introduced during 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure in 1974-75 is estimated at $15.3 million, an increase of $8.8 million on the previous year. The Government&#39;s decisions referred to above account for $2.9 million of the increase. </para>
        <para>Employment Training Schemes</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An initial allocation of $17.8 million has been provided in the 1974-75 Budget for the National Employment and Training System (NEAT) to be introduced from 1 October 1974. NEAT will provide a broader and more flexible system of training and retraining to meet and integrate the needs of individuals and the conditions of the labour market. NEAT will subsume employment training schemes presently administered by the Department of Labor and Immigration and the Department of Social Security&#39;s widow pensioner training scheme. Under NEAT the special rights and benefits applicable to Aborigines and Repatriation pensioners will be preserved. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Full-time and part-time training allowances under NEAT will have a fixed relationship with the average adult male award wage. Additional assistance includes living away from home allowances, payment of fees, books and equipment to the value of &#167;150 and fares. The costs of employers providing in-industry training and/or meeting the wage costs of trainees, or who release employees accepted for retraining during working hours, will be subsidised. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on all employment training schemes and for the improvement of training in industry and commerce in 1974-75 is estimated to total $20.5 million, an increase of $12.1 million on 1973-74. Provision is included in this figure for the administration of Aboriginal employment training and the vocational training scheme for Aborigines in the Northern Territory ($1.3 million). </para>
        <para>Assisted Migration</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In determining their targets for the annual migration program, successive Governments have been influenced by their assessment of the need for workers in Australia, the availability of suitable migrants, and Australia&#39;s capacity to absorb those migrants. Recognising the need to retain migrants and the social implications of the immigration program, the Government now places greater emphasis on family reunion in the composition of the annual migrant intake. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The proposed program for 1974-75 is 80,000 settlers, 30,000 less than in 1973-74. Assisted migrants are expected to number 40,000, 10,000 less than last year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under the program is estimated at $19.5 million in 1974-75, $1.7 million less than in 1973-74. The lower cost reflects the reduction in the assisted migration program partially offset by higher operating costs and an increased construction program to improve accommodation standards at migrant hostels. The main components of the assisted migration program in 1974-75 are embarkation and passage costs ($14.8 million) and transitory accommodation ($5.9 million). Contributions by assisted migrants towards passage costs are expected to reach $1.4 million in 1974-75. </para>
        <para>General Administration</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure in 1974-75 for the operating costs of the Department of Labor and Immigration is estimated at $63.8 million, an increase of $10.0 mil ion over 1973-74 expenditure. The increase is almost entirely due to the full-year effect of growth in staff numbers particularly in the employment and training areas and to the full-year effect of salary determinations. </para>

        <para>Economic and Trade Regulation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the outlays under this heading relate to the costs of operations of the various authorities listed. The Industries Assistance Commission was established by the Government in 1973 to inquire into and report to the Government on questions of assistance for all industries. The Tariff Board had previously advised on protection for manufacturing industry, and its activities have been taken over by the new Commission. Outlays shown in the table for .periods prior to the establishment of the Commission represent expenditure by the Tariff Board. The estimate of $1.9 million for &#39;Other&#39; in 1974-75 includes provision for the Metric Conversion Board and the National Standards Commission. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Recoveries under this heading, which are estimated to increase to $5.4 million in 1974-75, are mainly in the form of fees charged by the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices. </para>

        <para>Parliamentary Expenditure - Salaries and Allowances</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on Parliamentary salaries and allowances is expected to remain at about the same level as in 1973-74. The Government submitted the question of Parliamentary remuneration to the Remuneration Tribunal which released its Report in July 1974. The Tribunal&#39;s determination, recommending an increase in salaries paid to Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, was disallowed by the Parliament. </para>
        <para>Parliamentary Expenditure - Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This item covers salaries, administrative costs and capital works associated with the functioning of Parliament and includes costs relating to State and Electorate offices of Senators and Members of Parliament, ministerial staff and the staff of other officeholders. Of the $3.8 million increase, $2.8 million relates to increased salary costs and $0.4 million to increased costs of printing Hansard. Other general cost increases have been partly offset by a reduction of $0.3 million in the requirement for capital works in respect of Parliament House. Actual outlay for 1973-74 was generally lower than expected due to a fall in activities following the double dissolution of Parliament. </para>
        <para>Australian Electoral Office</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This item reflects the administrative costs of maintaining electoral rolls and the conduct of Australian Government elections and referenda. The exceptionally high level of expenditure in 1973-74 ($13.0 million) was due to the unscheduled House of Representatives election and various referenda held during the year. Provision has been made in 1974-75 for elections for the Northern Territory Legislative Council and the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly. </para>

A central office, eight branch offices and fifty-six regional offices of the Australian Legal Aid Office are expected to be established during 1974-75. The total cost for 1974-75 is expected to be $12.4 million and includes payments to private legal practitioners estimated at $3.6 million, grants to the extent of $1.3 million to supplement existing legal aid schemes and $2 million (an increase of $0.8 million over 1973-74) for legal aid to Aboriginals. </para>

        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">This heading embraces most of the costs incurred by the Australian Government in the pursuit of polices designed to foster our relations with foreign countries and external territories. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The bulk of the expenditures (about 79 per cent in 1974-75) relates to various external economic aid programs undertaken by Australia to assist developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, to achieve faster rates of economic growth and thereby raise their living standards. A detailed explanation of these aid programs is given in <inline font-style="italic">Budget Paper No. 9</inline> entitled &#39;Australia&#39;s External Aid 1974-75&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays on foreign affairs and overseas aid are estimated to increase by $63.1 million, or 17.4 per cent, in 1974-75 to $425.9 million. As the following table shows, the net increase in aid payments accounts for most of this increase. </para>
        <para>Aid Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Australia&#39;s various aid programs are discussed in detail in <inline font-style="italic">Budget Paper No. 9</inline> referred to above, which also brings together some expenditures of an external aid nature which are subsumed in other functional -headings in this Statement. That Paper also comments briefly on Australia&#39;s relative aid performance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The substantial increase in aid expenditures provided for in 1974-75 reflects very large increases for both Mut i lateral and Bilateral aid programs and a reduction in aid to Papua New Guinea. The decrease in aid payments to Papua New Guinea in 1974-75 arises because of the substantial special assistance which was given to that country in 1973-74 to facilitate its transition to self-government on 1 December 1973. A considerable part of that assistance ($34.8 million) was provided to facilitate the &#39;purchase&#39; of assets previously owned in Papua New Guinea by certain Australian Government departments and instrumentalities which the Papua New Guinea Government was obliged to take over to enable it to continue to perform the various associated functions for which it assumed responsibility during 1973-74. After allowing for receipts from the &#39;sale&#39; of these assets - shown as recoveries in other functional headings in this Statement - and other non-recurring assistance provided to Papua New Guinea in 1973-74 to help establish certain public institutions (e.g. the government commercial bank and national airline) of a self-financing nature, aid payments to Papua New Guinea in 1974-75 will show a significant increase over the comparable figure for 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The large increase in Bilateral aid payments is mainly accounted for by a proposed contribution of $40 million by Australia towards the United Nations Special Program to assist developing countries which have been seriously affected by the recent oil price increases and other related international developments; there is also an estimated increase of $8.2 million in expenditure on Colombo Plan projects and Special Aid to Indo-China. The expected growth in Multilateral aid payments is largely explained by substantial increases in Australia&#39;s contributions to various United Nations and other international aid programs, as well as estimated increases of $4.7 million in payments <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> International Development Association and $3.0 million to the Asian Development Bank. </para>
        <para>Cocos (Keeling), Christmas and Norfolk Islands</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this item are the costs involved in administering these three small external territories. A program for the restoration of historic buildings on Norfolk Island, commenced in 1973-74, will continue during 1974-75. An allocation of $159,000 has been made in the Budget for this purpose. </para>
        <para>Membership of International Organisations and Other Non-Aid Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This item encompasses expenditures incurred by virtue of Australia&#39;s membership of a wide range of international organisations. Active participation in many global and regional organisations is an integral part of Australia&#39;s present foreign policy. This involves financial contributions towards the administrative expenses and, in some cases, the functional activities of the organisations in question. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total expenditure under this heading is expected to increase from $9.7 million in 1973-74 to $9.8 million in 1974-75. Among the increases are a provision of $583,000 for Australia&#39;s participation in the International Ocean Exposition at Okinawa in 1975, and planned increases in Australia&#39;s contributions in 1974-75 to the OECD (to $790,000) and the World Health Organisation (to $1,023,000). Expenditures associated with Australia&#39;s cultural relations with various other countries are also estimated to increase sharply from $555,000 in 1973-74 to $850,000 in 1974-75. Offsetting these increases are expected reductions in expenditures relating to Australia&#39;s participation in the International Exposition at Spokane in 1974, the United Nations Environment Fund, and the Inter-Governmental Commission on European Migration. </para>
        <para>General Administrative Expenditures</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included in this item are the administrative costs of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Australian Development Assistance Agency and the Overseas Property Bureau. The large increase in 1974-75 is explained in part by planned expenditures on a new construction program for chance ries in Bangkok (estimated total cost $3.9 million), Singapore (estimated total cost $3.6 million), Paris (estimated total cost, including associated apartment block, $11.8 million) and Wellington (estimated total cost $3.6 million). Provision has also been made for expenditure on major chancery extensions in Washington (estimated cost $3.5 million). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase in 1974-75 also reflects the provision of computer services for the Department of Foreign Affairs; the transfer to that Department of certain functions from the former Department of Immigration (mainly the issuing of passports); costs associated with running the Papua New Guinea Office in Sydney (recoverable from the Papua New Guinea Government) ; and the takeover by the Department of all locally engaged staff employed under the Public Service Act (previously included under other functions), as well as the provision of common management services, at all overseas posts in future. </para>
        <para font-style="bold">D. GENERAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH NEC </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The largest expenditure under this heading is that by CSIRO. Also included are expenditures on specific programs of research undertaken by several Government departments and instrumentalities, such as the research activities of the Department of Science in the Antarctic and the nuclear research activities of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Assistance for general research activities through the Australian Research Grants Committee, fellowship schemes and support for the learned academies are also shown under this heading. </para>

Initially, the work of the Institute is being directed to studies of the Great Barrier Reef, the Coral Sea and the coast and adjacent waters of North Queensland. The Institute will occupy temporary premises in Townsville pending the construction of a laboratory at Cape Ferguson. The increase in expenditure in 1974-75 reflects the further development of the Institute following the appointment of the Director in July 1974. As announced in the Budget Speech, provision of $25,000 is made for the design by the Department of Transport, with the assistance of an experienced overseas consultant, of a research vessel for the Institute. </para>

An amount of $220,000 has been included for the operation of a scientific balloon launching facility at Mildura previously operated on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The Government has approved in principle a grant to the University of Sydney to construct a large stellar interferometer (an astronomical research instrument). Included in the Budget is an initial grant of $75,000 to be paid to the University in 1974-75 for a detailed design study of the instrument. Assistance to Australian inventors has been provided in the past through a Government grant to the Inventors Association of Australia. In 1973-74 the grant amounted to $10,098.

        <para pgwide="yes">It should be noted that year-to-year comparisons of general revenue assistance are affected by some significant changes in the arrangements under which those grants are paid. Thus, beginning in 1971-72 the grants have been reduced to take into account the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States in September 1971, while the grants for 1973-74 and the estimates for 1974-75 reflect the reductions (amounting to $111.8 million and $229.7 million respectively) which the Australian and State Governments agreed should be made in view of the assumption of full financial responsibility for tertiary education by the Australian Government from January 1974. </para>

Tasmania withdrew from the Grants Commission system as from the beginning of 1974-75, following an agreement between the Australian and Tasmanian Governments under which the State will receive an amount of $15 million as an addition to the financial assistance grant otherwise payable to the State in 1974-75. </para>

Subsequently, the Australian Government decided to increase the total program by $92.5 million of which $29.7 million is to be provided as capital grants and the remaining $62.8 million as an addition to States&#39; borrowings. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Loan Council programs for 1973-74 and 1974-75 have been reduced by estimated amounts of capital expenditure of which the States have been relieved on account of the assumption by the Australian Government of full responsibility for financing tertiary education as from January 1974. With adjustments to make the figures comparable in both years, the 1974-75 program represents an effective increase of 21.5 per cent on the 1973-74 program.

It is estimated that $44.7 million will be paid to the States for flood and other disaster relief purposes during 1974-75; of this amount, $26.1 million is expected to be paid to Queensland.

        <para pgwide="yes">Customs duty collections in 1974-75 are estimated to total $770 million. Although imports in 1974-75 are forecast to be considerably higher than in 1973-74. the rate of increase underlying this estimate of collections is considerably less than that recorded in 1973-74. Nevertheless, the expected increase in collections in 1974-75 of 27.4 per cent compares with only 17.7 per cent in 1973-74, when collections were affected by the 25 per cent reduction in all &#39;non-revenue&#39; duty rates announced in July 1973. The 1974-75 estimate is also affected by increases in rates of customs duty on potable spirits and tobacco products announced on 23 July 1974. which are expected to yield $22.2 million this year. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Excise collections are estimated to increase by 13.5 per cent in 1974-75 compared with 22.6 per cent in 1973-74. The increases in excise duty rates on tobacco products and potable spirits announced on 23 July 1974 contribute $78 million to the estimated total increase of $210 million. However, in overall terms, the rate of increase in clearances of goods subject to excise duty in 1974-75 is forecast to be lower than that recorded in 1973-74.

        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in sales values of goods subject to sales tax in 1974-75 are not expected to reach the very high rates experienced in 1973-74; continuing rapid rises in prices are likely to be partly offset by a slow-down in the rate of increase in sales volumes compared with 1973-74. On the basis of existing legislation, sales tax collections are estimated to increase by 14.1 per cent to $1,105 million in 1974-75, compared with an increase of 26.6 per cent in 1973-74. </para>

Underlying this estimate are the assumptions that average weekly earnings per employed male unit will increase by 22.5 per cent and average actual employment by 2 per cent during 1974-75. In present circumstances, this average earnings assumption is even more uncertain than usual; while taking account of the movement that has already occurred, it does not imply that a reliable forecast of the trend in earnings for the remainder of the year can be made at this point. To the extent that the assumption should involve an under-estimate, inflation, and the effect of inflation on the Budget, will be that much greater. </para>

The relationship of refunds to gross pay-as-you-earn instalment deductions in 1974-75 is estimated to be somewhat below its 1973-74 level because it is expected that concessional deductions to be allowed on assessment will have increased at a lower rate than incomes in 1973-74. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated increase of S45.2 million in wool levy collections mainly reflects the increase in the rate of levy introduced in association with the new floor price arrangements for the 1974-75 season. The estimated increase in meat export charges of $22.1 million in 1974-75 reflects the first full-year operation of this charge and an expected increase in the rate of exports after a slow-down in the second half of 1973-74.

        <para>SUMMARY</para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Budget estimates and outcome for 1973-74 are summarised in the table below: </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="090131197009173_149_52.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The overall Budget result was a deficit of $293 million, compared with the original Budget estimate of $687 million. Both outlays and receipts exceeded the Budget estimates. Total outlays were $12,295 million, $130 million more than the Budget estimate, while receipts were $12,002 million, $524 million more. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Outlays from the 1973-74 Budget were significantly affected by large increases in wage and salary payments during the year. Direct wage and salary payments were $142 million more than allowed for in the Budget estimates. In addition, higher wage and salary costs were an important element in the increase of $65 million in the advance to the Post Office and, because the increase in average wages was faster than assumed, financial assistance grants to the States exceeded the Budget estimate by $69 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The increase in receipts over the Budget estimate reflected, in the main, the acceleration in inflation during the year. In particular, average weekly earnings increased considerably faster than the 13 per cent assumed at Budget time, and this was the main reason why net Paye income tax collections exceeded the Budget estimate by $298 million. </para>
        <para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Budget estimates for 1973-74 are compared with actual outlays in the following table: </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="090131197009173_150_0.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para>The main variations from the Budget estimates are discussed below. </para>
          <para>Defence</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays on defence in 1973-74 exceeded the Budget estimate by $63 million. Manpower costs were $97 million greater than the Budget estimate; wage and salary payments were $66 million greater than estimated, reflecting increases in rates of pay granted after the Budget, while outlays under the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme exceeded the estimate by $31 million, partly because more servicemen opted to retire under the new scheme than was originally estimated and a higher proportion of those retiring opted for lump sum payments. Against this, there were shortfalls in other areas of expenditure, notably defence equipment and stores and defence facilities. Supply difficulties, both domestic and overseas (the latter reflecting, in particular, industrial unrest in the United Kingdom) led to general slippages in delivery programs and a shortfall of $20 million in expenditure on equipment and stores. Outlays on defence facilities fell short of the estimate by $19 million, mainly because of general shortages of materials and labour. </para>
          <para>Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Education outlays in 1973-74 were a net $11 million greater than the Budget estimate. Recurrent payments to the universities exceeded the Budget estimate by $19 million, mainly because of a change in timing of payments associated with the assumption of full financial responsibility for universities. Recurrent payments to colleges of advanced education exceeded the Budget estimate by $19 million. Outlays for schools and pre-schools in the Territories were $13 million more than estimated at Budget time, the main contributing factors being increases in wage and salary rates and larger than estimated staff numbers, particularly in the Commonwealth Teaching Service. The major shortfall in outlays on education was in payments to the States for schools and pre-schools - actual payments fell short of the Budget estimate by $24 million. The States experienced problems in carrying through to the construction stage the new building programs approved on the recommendation of the Interim Schools Committee. In addition, the larger part of the pre-schools program was not finally approved until April 1974; difficulties were also encountered in the initial negotiations with local government authorities. Capital payments for colleges of advanced education fell short of the Budget estimate by $11 million as progress on construction programs fell behind planned rates. Similarly there was a shortfall of $9 million in the capital program for technical education. </para>
          <para>Health</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for health in 1973-74 fell short of the Budget estimate by $32 million. The major shortfalls, occurred in respect of hospital and medical benefits and nursing home benefits. Hospital and medical benefits payments were $20 million lower than the Budget estimate, partly because there was a smaller than expected increase in the number of services provided and partly because of a larger than normal lag in the processing of claims by the health insurance organisations. Payments of nursing home benefits were $8 million less than the Budget estimate, mainly reflecting smaller than expected growth in the number of nursing home beds. </para>
          <para>Social Security and Welfare</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for social security and welfare were $44 million more than the Budget estimate. Age, invalid and widows pensions were $39 million more than estimated, reflecting both the Government&#39;s decision to increase pension and benefit rates in Autumn by $3 rather than the $1 .50 allowed for at Budget time and also greater than assumed increases in the numbers of pension recipients. Similarly, payments of unemployment and sickness benefits were $29 million greater than the Budget estimate and payments of supporting mothers benefit were $6 million greater. These increases were partly offset by shortfalls in several other items. In the 1973-74 Budget provision was made for a payment of $10 million for special welfare assistance for persons unemployed as a result of the 25 per cent tariff cut, but in the event there were few applications for assistance and very little was spent. Payments for aged persons accommodation were $6 million less than the estimate, reflecting delays in building commencements. The child care program was also affected by slippages in construction programs and initial difficulties in negotiations with local government authorities, and consequently outlays were $6 million less than estimated at Budget time. </para>
          <para>Housing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for housing fell short of the Budget estimate by $12 million. The major part of this shortfall was in grants to Aboriginal housing associations for the construction and purchase of homes for Aboriginal families. These were $9 million lower than the Budget estimate, mainly because of delays in the establishment and commencement of operations of the associations. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays within this function, which covers the major initiatives of the Government announced in the 1973-74 Budget in respect of financial assistance for growth centres, sewerage programs, Land Commissions and metropolitan area improvement programs, fell short of the Budget estimate by $43 million. Delays in finalising arrangements with the State Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, followed by further delays in the introduction of legislation in those States, resulted in outlays for the Albury/Wodonga growth centre being only $2 million in 1973-74 compared with the Budget estimate of $9 million. Similarly, delays in finalising arrangements with the States meant that outlays for other growth centres were only $4 million compared with the Budget estimate of $24 million. Outlays in respect of Land Commissions totalled $11.5 million compared with the Budget estimate of $30 million. Only in South Australia was a land commission set up in 1973-74 and $8 million was provided to that State as a result; the remaining $3.5 million was in respect of the acquisition, in conjunction with the Victorian Government, of Emerald Hill. Most of the amounts provided in the Budget for sewerage and the western sectors of Sydney and Melbourne were spent during the year. </para>
          <para>Transport and Communication</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for transport and communication were $12 million less than the Budget estimate of $881 million. Expenditure on the Gidgealpa pipeline project fell $41 million short of the Budget estimate because of changes in the scope of the construction program and construction and other delays. Grants to the States for urban public transport were estimated to amount to $32 million at Budget time, but as Parliament adjourned earlier than expected the necessary legislation was not passed and the grants could not be paid (although the States had carried out part of the spending program involved). Commonwealth Railways&#39; capital outlays were $6 million less than estimated, the largest single cause being delays in completing an agreement for the construction of the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway. An increase of $65 million in the advance to the Post Office partly offset these shortfalls; this resulted largely from increases in wages and salaries and associated additional superannuation liabilities. Increases in wage and salary rates were also the main reason for an excess of $9 million above the Budget estimate in administrative and operational costs associated with the provision of civil aviation services. </para>
          <para>Water Supply and Electricity</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Of the shortfall of $9 million in this function, the advance to the Queensland Government for the Gladstone power station accounted for $7 million. The slower than expected rate of construction of the power station resulted from a combination of industrial disputes, material shortages and adverse weather conditions. </para>
          <para>Industry Assistance and Development</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total payments to assist and develop industry were $32 million less than the Budget estimate. Assistance for <inline font-style="italic">pastoral and agricultural industries</inline> exceeded the Budget estimate by $1 million, the net result of changes in several items. Rural reconstruction advances fell short of the Budget estimate by $1 1 million, there being a slower rate of applications for assistance than forecast. This and a number of smaller shortfalls were more than offset by payments of fertiliser bounties exceeding the Budget estimate by $20 million. The extra bounty payments were caused by increased purchases of fertilisers arising partly from improved rural conditions, partly from an impending rise in the price of superphosphate and partly from the announcement of the removal of the bounty on superphosphate in December 1974. Total payments for <inline font-style="italic">manufacturing industry</inline> were $30 million less than the Budget estimate. Net payments for shipbuilding assistance fell short of the Budget estimate by $10 million; fewer large ships were built during the year than anticipated at Budget time. An amount of $10 million was provided in the Budget for industry assistance following the 25 per cent tariff cut in July 1973, but no assistance was required up to 30 June 1974. Export incentive payments were $6 million less than originally estimated because of delays in processing of applications. </para>
          <para>Labour and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays in respect of labour and employment were $1 million less than the Budget estimate. The only major shortfall was in the $5 million provided for training and other assistance following the 25 per cent tariff cut, most of which was not required. The main offsetting increase was in administrative expenditure and resulted from increases in wage and salary rates. </para>
          <para>Legislative Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments for legislative services exceeded the Budget estimate by $10 million. The additional costs of the House of Representatives election and the referenda accounted for $5 million of this increase. </para>
          <para>Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays on foreign affairs and overseas aid was $1 million less than the Budget estimate. However, within the function there were some significant offsetting variations from the original estimates. The main increase was consequent upon higher than assumed wheat prices, which increased the cost of Australia&#39;s food aid commitment under the International Wheat Agreement by $13 million. In addition, payments of salaries and allowances to members of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group in Papua New Guinea were $4 million higher than estimated. On the other hand, Colombo Plan aid payments were some $1 1 million less than the Budget estimate and the payment to Papua New Guinea to facilitate the creation of a government commercial bank was $5 million less than expected at Budget time. </para>
          <para>Administrative Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on administrative services were $29 million more than the Budget estimate. The costs of wage and salary increases since the Budget accounted for most of the increase. The main non-salary increase was $4 million in expenditure on rentals for government offices, arising from new leases and increased rents. </para>
        <para class="italic" pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total payments to or for the States and local government authorities nec and natural disaster relief were $106 million greater than the Budget estimate. Financial assistance grants to the States exceeded the Budget estimate by $69 million because average wages increased considerably more rapidly than the 12 per cent assumed at Budget time. Payments for relief and restoration measures following the floods that occurred in Queensland and New South Wales in the early part of 1974 amounted to $29 million in 1973-74; no allowance was made in the Budget for disaster relief payments. </para>
        <para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Budget estimates for 1973-74 are compared with actual receipts in the following table: </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="090131197009173_154_54.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para class="block">The main variations from Budget estimates are discussed below. </para>
          <para>Customs Duty</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of customs duty exceeded the Budget estimate by $41 million. The normal difficulties in estimating customs duty were accentuated in 1973-74 by changes in currency parities and tariff rates, including the 25 per cent reduction in all protective tariffs in July and the exchange rate appreciation in September. Reflecting these changes and the high level of consumer demand, dutiable imports were greater, especially in the second half of the year, than had been assumed in arriving at the Budget estimate. </para>
          <para>Sales Tax</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Sales tax collections were $80 million more than the Budget estimate. The main cause of the higher collections was greater than assumed price increases of taxable goods. Sales volumes for most classes of goods were also greater than assumed. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax - Individuals - Pay-as-you-earn</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Gross collections of PAYE instalment deductions were $323 million above the Budget estimate. The main factor was that, whereas at Budget time it had been assumed that average weekly earnings would increase by 13 per. cent in 1973-74, the actual increase was 16.3 per cent. In addition, average employment increased by 4.5 per cent rather than 3.5 per cent as assumed in the formulation of the Budget estimate. PAYE refunds were $27 million up on the Budget estimate. </para>
          <para>Income Tax - Individuals - Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections on assessments of income tax on individuals exceeded the Budget estimate by $13 million, because property incomes and other business incomes in 1972-73 (assessed to tax in 1973-74) were slightly higher than estimated at Budget time. </para>
          <para>Income Tax - Companies</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Company tax collections were $91 million more than the Budget estimate. Company incomes in 1972-73 (which were subject to tax in 1973-74) increased by 25 per cent, a much larger increase than indicated by the preliminary data available when the Budget was prepared. </para>
          <para>Other Taxes, Fees and Fines</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Collections of other taxes, fees and fines exceeded the Budget estimate by $4 million. Following higher than expected wheat prices for the 1973-74 crop, $10 million was collected from the wheat export charge in 1973-74; no allowance was made in the Budget for collections of this charge. Wool tax collections exceeded the Budget estimate by $5 million because wool prices were higher than originally assumed. Collections of the meat exports charge were $7 million less than the Budget estimate, partly because the scheme was introduced later in the year than anticipated, and partly because of the slowing down of beef exports during the year. </para>
          <para>Sale of Land and Buildings</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Proceeds from the sale of land and buildings were $33 million less than the Budget estimate. Proceeds from lease sales in the Australian Capital Territory were $34 million less than the estimate, mainly reflecting a change in the system of land disposal in Canberra. There was also a smaller turn-off of serviced blocks than planned. </para>
        <para>FINANCING TRANSACTIONS</para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">The following table presents a summary of financing transactions in 1973-74: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">Loan (Defence) Acts</inline> of 1966, 1968, 1970, 1971 and 1973 authorised the Government to finance defence equipment purchases in the United States of America on extended payment terms. In 1973-74 no drawings were made under these arrangements. Repayments of previous drawings were $54 million. </para>

          <para>Net Proceeds of Other Overseas Borrowing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There were no public loan raisings overseas in 1973-74. Redemptions and other expenditure on the reduction of debt overseas totalled $66 million. One maturity in London was redeemed at a cost of $12 million. Securities to the value of $31 million were repurchased in New York, Germany, London and Canada. Repayments of $7 million were made on borrowings from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and $15 million on borrowings from the United States Export-Import Bank </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Net Proceeds of Loan Raisings in Australia</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Three Government public cash loans were raised in Australia in 1973-74. Excluding loan proceeds from advance subscriptions received up to 30 June 1973 but including receipts from outstanding instalments and advance subscriptions received up to 30 June 1974, the proceeds from these cash loans totalled $1,145 million. Cash proceeds from the sale of Special Bonds during the year totalled $454 million. Proceeds of $49 million from State domestic loan raisings and $3 million from Drought Bonds brought total cash proceeds from loans raised in Australia to $1,651 million. Of the $667 million of securities (other than Special Bonds) maturing in Australia which were offered for conversion in 1973-74, an amount of $461 million was redeemed. Redemptions of Special Bonds of all series amounted to $371 million. Market repurchases amounted to $6 million, bringing total redemptions and repurchases to $837 million and net proceeds of loans raised in Australia in 1973-74 to $814 million. </para>

          <title>STATEMENT No. 6 - BUDGET TRANSACTIONS SINCE 1964-65</title>
          <page.no>1392</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
          <para>Introduction</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This Statement discusses trends in Budget transactions since 1964-65 and presents, for the first time, a historical series of outlays classified by function. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Two complementary methods of classifying Budget outlays are used throughout the Budget Speech and Statements, each of which is important in analysing the use and direction of resources in the Budget. The <inline font-style="italic">functional classification,</inline> used for the first time in last year&#39;s Budget documents, categorises Budget outlays according to their primary objectives or purposes. In highlighting the broad purposes for which outlays are made, the functional classification is a particularly important development as an aid in the decision-making process. The <inline font-style="italic">national accounting classification</inline> details Budget outlays by economic type and facilitates the comparison of Budget aggregates with the Australian National Accounts. This is the more useful classification for assessing the overall economic impact of the Budget. </para>
          <para>Functional Classification</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In bringing together categories of outlays with similar objectives or purposes, the functional classification aims to reveal more fully information on the nature of Government activities and the share of resources devoted to particular objectives. It also provides a logical framework within which programs can be developed to facilitate an assessment of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. An added advantage is the use of national accounting conventions for the definition of Budget outlays and receipts. This means that the figures used for the analysis and discussion of outlays by function are in line with those used in the analysis of the economic impact of the Budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The introduction of the functional classification and the concurrent adoption of national accounting conventions resulted in a number of important changes in the definition of Budget aggregates such as Total Outlays&#39; (formerly Total Expenditures) and &#39;Total Receipts&#39;. Further information on these changes is given in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">When the functional classification of outlays was introduced in the 1973-74 Budget Speech it was only possible to present detailed historical data in the new format for the years 1970-71 to 1972-73. Functionally classified historical Budget data for the years 1964-65 to 1969-70 have now been compiled, and a series covering the period 1964-65 to 1974-75 is presented in summary form in Table 1 on page 115, and in more detail in Table 2 on pages 116 to 122 and Table 4 on page 124. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification is essentially a re-classification of appropriation data, supplemented where possible with sub-costings of appropriation items of substantial magnitude that cover several functions. However, the amount of detail shown in Table 2 has been reduced in comparison with that in Statement No. 3, for ease of presentation and because the sub-costings necessary to eliminate the effects of all changes in accounting procedures and administrative arrangements are not always available. To the extent possible the definitions and concepts used in constructing this series are the same as those used in Statement No. 3. <inline font-weight="bold">Major discontinuities</inline> are indicated by footnotes or referred to in the following text. </para>
          <para>Budget Sector Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays by the Australian Government Budget Sector increased at an average annual rate of 11 .0 per cent over the period 1964-65 to 1973-74, but within that period there were some significant changes in the rates of growth and relative size of the various functional categories of outlays. The distribution of total outlays between the broad functional categories and changes in that distribution from year to year provide some indication of the importance attached to particular expenditure programs and focus attention on changing objectives and priorities of public expenditure. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Comparison of trends in outlays shown in the tables are affected by the following factors. </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Figures for 1971-72 and subsequent years for General Revenue Assistance to the States and for total outlays are not strictly comparable with earlier years. The more recent figures are affected by the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, with effect from 1 September 1971, and concurrent reductions in General Revenue Assistance to offset most of the loss in revenue incurred by the Australian Government Budget Sector. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>Increases in special purpose payments to the States are recorded under the appropriate functional heading, while &#39;offsetting adjustments&#39; to General Revenue Assistance Grants to the States are taken into account in the function <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief.</inline> In 1973-74 the take-over of full responsibility for financing universities and colleges of advanced education by the Australian Government contributed to an increase in outlays classified to <inline font-style="italic">Education,</inline> but also involved a compensating decline in general purpose funds provided to the States. This means that the rate of increase in Australian Government resources devoted to education, as shown in the function <inline font-style="italic">Education,</inline> is somewhat overstated. There will be a similar effect in 1974-75 because the new tertiary education arrangements apply for the whole of that year whereas they applied for only half of 1973-74. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>Figures for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the function <inline font-style="italic">Defence,</inline> and under the receipts heading <inline font-style="italic">Other Taxes, Fees and Fines - Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions</inline> are affected by the changes in the operation of the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>The figures are in current prices, meaning that they do not directly reflect the rate of increase in resources devoted to particular functional categories. Furthermore, differential rates of price increase between both functional categories and economic types of outlays will distort comparisons of relative growth rates in outlays within and between functions. These difficulties also apply to comparisons between public and private sector outlays. </para>

        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">A comparison of outlays in the years 1964-65 and 1973-74 is given in the table below. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Drawing on the more detailed information given in Table 2, comment on some features of the table and chart is given below. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Defence</inline>outlays grew from 12.9 per cent of budget outlays in 1964-65  to 17.1 per cent in 1967-68 with payments for the F111C fighter bomber, other re-equipment programs and Australian involvement in the Vietnam conflict. Withdrawal from Vietnam, cessation of National Service, the tapering off of payments on equipment programs and reductions in Service and civilian personnel in 1973-74 resulted in the decline to 10.9 per cent of total outlays in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase in outlays on <inline font-style="italic">Education, Health</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Social Security and Welfare</inline> has accounted for approximately 40 per cent of the increase in total outlays between 1964-65 and 1973-74. Over that period, outlays on these functions have grown from 28 per cent of total outlays to 35 per cent. Outlays relating to universities and colleges of advanced education have risen approximately eight-fold over the period, reflecting the takeover of financial responsibility by the Australian Government, expanded student assistance programs and increased allowances, and increased grants for recurrent and capital purposes associated with a growing student population. Recently, increased government assistance has been directed to teacher education, primary and secondary education and pre-school and child care services. Until recently, the greater part of the increase in outlays on health was on benefits to reduce the costs of treatment but outlays on the provision, and in some cases operational costs, of health facilities throughout Australia are now increasing strongly. The cost of providing assistance to the aged, ex-service men and women, the handicapped and other disadvantaged groups in the community is reflected in the average annual rise of 11.7 per cent in outlays on Social Security and Welfare. Adjustments to the levels of benefits, together with additional benefits and subsidies introduced over the years to cater for the welfare needs of the community, are the main factors contributing to this increase. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The average annual rate of growth in <inline font-style="italic">Housing</inline> outlays has been 7 per cent. The proportion of total outlays on this function has fallen from 3.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent over the period. However, a greater proportion of outlays has been directed towards providing general housing assistance under Commonwealth State Housing Agreements (or in their place, Loan Council borrowing programs in 1971-72 and 1972-73) and direct assistance in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The change in eligibility provisions for defence service home loans has reversed the downward trend in housing assistance under the Defence Service Homes scheme, while the slow down in the assisted immigration program is reflected in the sharp decline in the cost of providing accommodation for migrants. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although outlays on <inline font-style="italic">Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment</inline> have accounted for only 1 .7 per cent of the total increase in outlays since 1964-65, and represented only 1.2 per cent of total outlays in 1973-74, this is the fastest growing function in the Budget (25.9 per cent annual average increase). This reflects recent initiatives in the area of growth centres development, sewerage programs and environmental protection. Prior to 1971-72, most outlays classified under this function were directed towards providing urban facilities in Canberra and the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net outlays on <inline font-style="italic">Transport and Communication</inline> have increased at an average annual rate of 9 . 4 per cent over the period. Outlays on communications, expansion of assistance provided under the Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation and more recently, outlays on the construction of pipelines for natural gas and other materials have been significant factors in this growth. Gross and net outlays on air transport have also grown over the period. Gross advances to the States for railway standardisation projects, which increased in the early part of the decade, are offset by repayments resulting in a fall in net outlays for such purposes, in recent years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The decline in outlays on <inline font-style="italic">Water Supply and Electricity</inline> at an average annual rate of 3.8 per cent reflects progress towards the completion of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme and the completion of a number of electricity and water supply projects in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. The decline has been offset to some extent in recent years by advances in connection with the construction of the Gladstone power station. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on <inline font-style="italic">Industry Assistance and Development</inline> have fluctuated widely over the period. In the category of Agricultural and Pastoral Industries, this has been the result of changing market and climatic conditions together with changes, as in the case of the wheat industry, in stabilization and subsidy arrangements. The recent removal or scaling down of a number of subsidy arrangements will have a substantial impact on outlays under this function in future years. By convention, receipts from certain industry levies (e.g., wool tax) are classified as &#39;Receipts&#39; and not offset against outlays under this function. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on <inline font-style="italic">General Public Services,</inline> which relate in the main to the normal functioning of government, as well as overseas grants and advances for development purposes, have maintained a relatively constant share of total budget sector outlays over the period. Within the <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid</inline> category, assistance to Papua New Guinea and bilateral aid payments have been the major factors contributing to the increase. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief</inline>have declined as a proportion of total budget outlays from 25.3 per cent in 1964-65 to 22.5 per cent in 1973-74. However, expenditure classified under this category excludes payments for specific purposes such as universities, schools and nursing homes, which are included under the relevant functional heading. </para>
          <para>Budget Sector Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of Australian Government Budget Sector receipts for the period 1964-65 to 1 973-74, together with 1974-75 estimates, are presented in Table 4 on page 124. Data on the composition of Budget receipts in 1964-65 and 1973-74 are shown in the following table. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">By far the most important single category of receipts is income tax on individuals, which has accounted for over half the increase in the period, rising from 36. 1 per cent of total revenue in 1964-65 to 45.7 per cent in 1973-74. The increase has been determined to a large extent by the growth in net pay-as-you-earn income tax from wage and salary earners, reflecting the effects of the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in wage and salary incomes, despite adjustments to the rate scale in 1970-71 and 1972-73. Customs and excise duties have steadily declined as a proportion of total receipts, whilst sales tax has formed a relatively constant proportion of total receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pay-roll tax revenue after 1972-73 relates to collections in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory only. This is the result of the transfer of this tax from the Australian Government to the States in 1971. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The major items contributing to the average annual increase of 10.1 per cent in &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines&#39; are broadcasting and television licences and receipts in the form of unfunded retirement benefit contributions following changes to the operation of the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the category &#39;Interest, Rent and Dividends&#39;, the most significant increase has been in interest receipts from the Australian Post Office. Similarly, the impact of profits received from the Reserve Bank has largely determined the overall pattern in the net receipts from Government Enterprise Transactions. </para>
          <para>The Budget Deficit</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 1 shows the Budget deficit in each of the years from 1964-65 to 1974-75. This aspect is discussed later in this Statement under the sub-heading &#39;The Overall Budget Result&#39;. </para>
          <para>National Accounts Classification</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The national accounts for the economy as a whole aim at providing a systematic summary of the transactions that take place within the economy, especially of those that relate to the production and use of goods and services, and to transfers of income or capital between sectors of the economy. The national accounts classify transactions into suitable categories and, by outlining the relationships between the categories, enable analysis of the processes by which production and expenditure are linked. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Traditional methods of presenting estimates of public sector receipts and expenditure grew out of the requirement for maintaining parliamentary control over government spending. Estimates presented in a form suitable for this purpose do not necessarily lend themselves to an assessment of the economic impact of government financial activity. By presenting Budget sector data on a basis which is conceptually consistent with, and more easily related to, the National Accounts for the economy as a whole, the National Accounting presentation of Budget transactions by economic type clarifies the nature of transactions between the public sector and the rest of the economy. The classification also provides a consistent framework within which the aggregation of Australian Government and State and local authority outlays and receipts is facilitated, to produce consolidated figures for the public sector as a whole. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is no single measure of the economic importance of government transactions. In terms of national accounting categories, the most direct influence that Budget outlays have on demand within the economy is by means of expenditure on final goods and services, i.e. the resources used in the provision of public goods such as defence, education, health and community amenities. Transfers and advances from the Budget to other sectors are also important, but the impact on economic activity of these outlays depends on the reaction of the recipients of the transfers and advances. For Budget receipts, it is likewise true that any assessment of their effect on the economy has to take into account the varying impact of different taxes and other receipts. The total impact of the Budget is an amalgam of all these influences. </para>
          <para>Australian Government Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The contribution of the Australian Government and its authorities - as distinct from State and local governments - to recent growth in the size of the public sector has been dominated by the transactions of the Budget sector. In 1973-74, for example, the Budget&#39;s direct call on resources, in the form of final expenditure on goods and services, represented over 80 per cent of final expenditure by the Australian Government sector as a whole. Advances from the Budget to Australian Government authorities also finance a significant part of final expenditures on goods and services recorded in the non-Budget sector. Expenditure on goods and services, however, represents only a moderate and, in recent years declining, proportion of total Budget outlays. The majority of the Australian Government&#39;s budgetary transactions are transfer payments and advances to other sectors of the economy, including other government sectors. In 1973-74 transfer payments and net advances accounted for as much as 75 per cent of total Budget outlays, of which close to half represented grants and net advances to State Governments. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 3, attached to this Statement, shows Budget outlays since 1964-65 on a national accounts basis, while Table 4 shows information on Budget receipts and Table 6 gives details of financing transactions. On this basis, transfers between different parts of the accounts of the Australian Government are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Australian Government and the rest of the economy, including other levels of government, and overseas. The national accounts figures therefore show government transactions classified into economically significant categories comparable to those presented in the White Paper <inline font-style="italic">National Income and Expenditure</inline> 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the past decade there has been a tendency for Australian Government Budget outlays to grow somewhat faster than expenditures in the economy as a whole. The following table compares the average annual rates of growth of the main components of Budget outlays with the average annual rate of growth in gross national expenditure for the period since 1964-65. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the nine-year period, the major elements of Budget outlays, except for net advances, increased more rapidly than gross national expenditure. Total transfer payments have grown strongly over the period, and rather faster than direct expenditure on goods and services, both current and capital, which have grown at much the same annual average rate. The patterns of growth of direct expenditure and transfers have also differed. Mainly as a result of fluctuations in defence expenditure, current expenditure on goods and services grew more rapidly in the period 1964-65 to 1968-69 (16.3 per cent per annum) than in the period since 1968-69 (10.9 per cent per annum). Similarly, the average annual rate of growth in capital expenditure declined from 15.4 per cent in the first period to 9.7 per cent in the second. On the other hand, growth in total transfer payments accelerated from an annual average of 9. 1 per cent in the first period to 16.5 per cent in the second. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking the period as a whole, the Budget&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline> call on resources, as measured by final expenditure on goods and services, grew strongly from 5 . 5 per cent of gross national expenditure in 1964-65 to 7.2 per cent in 1968-69, but declined thereafter to 6.2 per cent by 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In assessing the total economic impact of the Budget on <inline font-style="italic">final</inline> demand for goods and services it is not, however, sufficient to look only at its <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline> call on goods and services. This is because, as noted previously, the larger proportion of Budget outlays is in the form of transfer payments, such as payments of pensions, subsidies, interest and grants, and the call on resources from such payments depends on the uses to which the recipients put the funds. Other Budget outlays take the form of advances and the economic impact of these is different again. Consequently, it is necessary to take account of variations in the composition of total outlays in analysing the Budget&#39;s impact. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on goods and services declined as a proportion of total Budget outlays from a peak of 29.5 per cent in 1968-69 (associated with the strong growth in defence spending in the preceding years) to 24.8 per cent in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Conversely, cash benefits to persons consistently increased as a percentage of total outlays from a low of 20.5 per cent in 1967-68 to 25 per cent in 1973-74. Although it is not possible to specify precisely the final use of funds transferred from the Budget in this way, it is well known that many of the recipients of these benefits have very high marginal propensities to spend and thus this category of outlays is likely to have a fairly immediate and strong influence on final demand for consumption goods. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A major proportion of Australian Government outlays comprises payments to the States. Because of changes from time to time in the methods of making such payments, it is more useful to look at &#39;Grants to the States&#39; and &#39;Net Advances to the States&#39; as one category. Considered as a whole, payments to the States have normally accounted for about one-third of Australian Government Budget outlays. Over the last ten years, the lowest proportion was 31.2 per cent in 1968-69 and the highest 34.0 per cent in 1973-74. These outlays are to finance, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> the States&#39; health and education services and their works and housing programs. As with cash benefits, it is not practicable to trace through precisely the final use of all these funds from the Budget. Moreover, the timing of outlays by the States can differ from the timing of payments to them of funds to finance those outlays. In the recent economic situation, for example, the timing of outlays has been affected by problems in finding resources of men, materials and equipment with which to undertake projects and programs financed by the Australian Government. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Advances other than to the States are chiefly distributed within the Australian Government sector itself in the form of advances to government instrumentalities operating outside the Budget. These include the Post Office, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, the Australian National Airlines Commission, Qantas Airways Limited, and the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Advances to such authorities in 1973-74 amounted to $468 million or 3 . 8 per cent of budget outlays. Again, it is not practicable to trace through the precise utilisation of the funds advanced to these instrumentalities from the Budget. It is, however, possible to offset transfers between the Budget and non-Budget sectors of the Australian Government and to consolidate outlays, other than intersect or transfers, to form a statement of the outlays and receipts of the Australian Government sector as a whole. The method of consolidation used is outlined in the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities,</inline> presented concurrently with the Budget documents. Table 5, attached to this Statement, sets out national accounts estimates of the main categories of receipts and outlays of the Australian Government sector as a whole for the period since 1964-65. Total outlays by the non-Budget sector amounted to $1,028 million in 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There are substantial differences between the relative composition of outlays of the Australian Government sector as a whole and that of the Budget sector alone. The following table details the composition of outlays for 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As the table shows, final expenditure on goods and services represents a greater proportion of total Australian Government outlays than of Budget outlays. The greater outlays of the non-Budget authorities for capital purposes lift capital expenditure from 2.3 per cent to 8 . 3 per cent of total outlays. There are consequent declines for transfers and advances. </para>
          <para>Total Public Sector Direct Expenditure or Goods and Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking into account State Governments and local authorities, the relative size of public sector direct expenditure on goods and services has not changed greatly in recent years. The following table shows the trend in the public sector&#39;s relative take-up of final goods and services over the period since 1964-65. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="090131197009173_167_62.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">As shown in the table, there was a marked lift in the proportion of public sector direct demands on resources to total final demand in the four years to 1967-68, reflecting, among other things, increased defence expenditure. Over the next three years the proportion remained fairly steady at around 21 .7 per cent before rising again in 1971-72 and 1972-73. This rise largely reflected decreased demand for resources by the private sector as economic activity slowed. The Australian Government Budget for 1973-74 seemed likely to increase the share of resources going to the public sector, but this was nullified by booming activity in the private sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The growth pattern of <inline font-style="italic">final consumption</inline> expenditure on goods and services, however, has differed from that of <inline font-style="italic">capital</inline> expenditure. In most years since 1964-65, public sector final consumption expenditure has grown at a faster rate than gross national expenditure, the ratio of the two increasing steadily from 10.4 per cent in 1964-65 to 13.7 per cent in 1973-74. Public capital expenditure growth has been more erratic; its share of gross national expenditure reached a peak of 9.8 per cent in 1965-66, and has since fluctuated around a generally declining trend to a low-point of 7.9 per cent in 1973-74. </para>
          <para>Budget Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total budget receipts in national accounts terms have increased at an annual average rate of 11.5 per cent over the period from 1964-65, rising from 22.2 per cent of gross domestic product to 24.1 per cent in 1973-74. These receipts comprise taxes of various types together with a number of other charges, interest, rent and dividends. As with outlays, different types of receipts have different effects on the economy. Taxes on incomes, for example, influence private demand for goods and services by determining the level of disposable incomes; sales taxes, on the other hand, affect private demand through the prices of goods. Consequently, the &#39;mix&#39; of Budget revenues, as well as their total size, needs to be considered in any assessment of the overall impact of the Budget on the economy. Trends in the different types of receipts were outlined in the previous section. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total taxation revenues increased at an annual average rate of 11.8 per cent over the period. Within this total, revenue from individual income taxation has increased at an average rate of 14.2 per cent, whereas the rate of increase in indirect taxation revenue has been only 8 . 6 per cent. The relatively slow growth in indirect taxation is partly the result of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States as from 1 September 1971. </para>
          <para>The Overall Budget Result</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government has consistently incurred a deficit on its budgetary transactions over the decade 1964-65 to 1973-74. The size of the deficit, however, has varied from year to year, reaching a peak of $709 million in 1972-73 and a low of $10 million in 1970-71. The largest absolute increase in the deficit- $575 million- occurred in 1972-73. In 1967-68 the deficit was 2.6 per cent of gross national expenditure, the highest proportion over the period. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Historical information on the domestic budget result <inline font-style="italic">(see</inline> Statement No. 1) is available only for the years since 1968-69. This is shown in the following table, along with the overall Budget result for the same years. </para>
        <para class="block">

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In each of the four years 1968-69 to 1971-72, Budget domestic transactions resulted in a surplus, the largest occurring in 1970-71. In 1972-73 there was a marked turnaround of $620 million, resulting in a domestic deficit of $215 million. In 1973-74 the domestic result was a surplus of $211 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main financing transactions undertaken to meet the deficits in the Budget over the period have been domestic and overseas loan raisings, the issue of Treasury Notes, and temporary borrowings from the Reserve Bank. Details of these financing transactions are given in Table 6 attached to this Statement. </para>
        <para class="block">Notes on Tables </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To the extent it is practical, the historical data has been adjusted to eliminate major breaks in series. However, some important changes which affect year to year comparability cannot be readily removed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the Premiers&#39; Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Australian Government would cease to levy pay-roll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own pay-roll taxes as from the same date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Australian Government pay-roll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transfer arrangements had the effect of reducing the growth of outlays and receipts below the rate that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the Tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years will not, of course, be affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other areas where accounting changes or changes in administrative arrangements affect comparability of the series over time include; offset adjustments to General Revenue Payments to the States consequent upon the assumption by the Australian Government of financial responsibility for certain activities; alterations in some retirement benefit arrangements from funded to unfunded schemes; and changes in the form of grants and advances to the States which were ultimately utilized for housing purposes. These major changes are referred to in the text, particularly on page 102, and in footnotes to the tables. </para>

          <title>APPENDIX TO THE BUDGET STATEMENTS - THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF BUDGET OUTLAYS</title>
          <page.no>1419</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification of budget outlays was used for the first time in the Budget Statements in 1973-74. The basic aim of the functional classification is to bring together outlays with like objectives or purposes. In this way it aims to reveal more fully information on the nature of government activities and the share of resources devoted to particular objectives, and to facilitate assessment of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Compared with the previous classification, the functional classification has the added value of being based on national accounting conventions. There is thus a consistent conceptual basis underlying both the economic classification and the functional classification. This removes a considerable source of confusion which existed in budget documents prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually different classifications were used - the so-called &#39;conventional&#39; classification and the national accounting classification. </para>
      <para class="block">Basis of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The conventions and principles used in the functional classification are essentially those set out for the classification of outlays by the purpose of government in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts,</inline> United Nations, New York 1968. That classification is a widely accepted international standard for the classification of public expenditure by function and is also being used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a basis for the development of internationally comparable statistics on the public sector. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has concurrently adopted these conventions and principles for purpose classifications in the documents it publishes on public authority finance. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As a result of close co-operation between the Bureau of Statistics and the Treasury in the development of this classification structure, the major functional headings adopted for budget purposes are conceptually consistent with those used by the Statistician in his publications. It should be noted, however, that the figures published by the Bureau for Australian Government outlays cover both budget outlays and outlays by Australian Government authorities which operate outside the budget sector and hence will differ in some respects from the figures shown for the budget sector in the Budget Statements. Information on the transactions of authorities operating outside the budget sector is shown in the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities</inline> which is published concurrently with the budget documents. In addition, a number of Australian Government departments and instrumentalities which operate in Papua New Guinea incur direct expenditures which may be classified as aid to a developing country. These outlays, however, are shown under the same functional heading in the Budget Statements as similar outlays made within Australia. Supplementary information on the functional allocation of these outlays is available in the Bureau&#39;s publication <inline font-style="italic">Public Authority Finance - Authorities of the Australian Government,</inline> 1973-74. </para>
      <para class="block">The Structure of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The major functional headings are shown in the summary table in Statement No. 3. Brief descriptions of the contents of each function are given below. These descriptions are intended to convey the scope of the outlays included under each function rather than to be a detailed listing of the content of each category. Further detail on each function is provided in the discussion in Statement No. 3. Historical data for the period 1964-65 to 1973-74 are given in summary form in Statement No. 6. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Some changes have been made in the functional headings and their contents as shown in Statements No. 4 and 8 in the Budget Speech 1973-74. The various outlays on &#39;Immigration&#39; have been allocated to appropriate functions including the renamed &#39;Labour and Employment&#39; function (previously &#39;Employment Conditions&#39;). Reconsideration of the previous treatment was made necessary by the administrative re-arrangements announced by the </para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Government in June 1974. Water supply and sewerage undertakings in the Territories have been classified as business undertakings, in accordance with national accounting conventions. These changes are in line with international practice. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">From an examination of the classification structure set out in the Budget Statements it will be evident that the functional classification is at this stage relatively aggregative in nature. It has not, for example, been possible on the whole to dissect the administrative outlays of departments and to allocate them over the particular sub-categories shown under each functional heading. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Under each functional heading in the classification, outlays have been grouped together into readily identifiable expenditure blocks. These expenditure blocks do not, as a rule, purport to represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions or programs; rather, they are meant as recognisable and meaningful groupings which readily lend themselves to discussion and analysis. Nevertheless, the main outlay blocks are decidedly more purpose-oriented than was the case with the categories of expenditure identified under the conventional classification used in the past. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Given the need to produce a continuing and up-to-date record of actual monthly outlays and receipts which is consistent with the overall estimates embodied in the Budget Speech and documents, it has been necessary to work largely within existing central accounting records. These records are, at present, built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than detailed costing documents. The figures presented have, therefore, been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data supplemented, where necessary, by a limited number of sub-costings of substantial appropriation items which cover several functions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The problems of using existing accounting records for the purposes of the functional classification were magnified by the major changes to departmental administrative arrangements which were announced in December 1972 and June 1974. These changes have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent set of outlay aggregates for the periods covered in the Budget Statements. Where possible, the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by the sub-costing and regrouping of appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies to produce strict comparability of detailed estimates. This should be borne in mind when examining the tables set out in Statement No. 3 and particularly Statement No. 6. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It should also be noted that the functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. Furthermore, some outlay and receipt figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may, therefore, be classified under more than one functional heading and it will not always be possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Statements. The introduction of the functional classification does not, however, alter the structure of the appropriations or the summaries presented with the Appropriation Bills, such as the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure.</inline></para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the broad purposes for which government outlays are undertaken, it is important to note that such a classification cannot always be unambiguously applied. Particular items will often serve two or more distinct functions. Military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme, however, requires that outlays be classified to the function which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example above, the primary function is considered to be defence. This is also in line with United Nations recommendations. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As in any single classification system, it is not possible to focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to the Government or the public. Supplementary information on particular aspects of expenditure is therefore provided in other documents; for example, details of wage and salary estimates are shown in the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure</inline> and a separate White Paper is provided on <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities.</inline> Other supplementary documents or statements may in future years be provided in order to focus on outlays related to particular policies or activities. </para>
      <para>The Implications of Adopting National Accounting Conventions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As indicated earlier in this Appendix, the use of definitions of budget outlays and receipts based on national accounting conventions places budget data on a basis which is conceptually consistent with national accounting information published by the Bureau of Statistics and can more easily be related to trends in the public sector as a whole and developments in the economy reflected in that information. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principles underlying the national accounting presentation of budget data are set out in the Appendix to the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities,</inline> September 1974. Concurrent with the introduction of the functional classification in 1973-74, some changes were made to the previous national accounting definitions of outlays, receipts, the deficit, and their components used in the Budget Statements. The more significant of these changes were: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Net advances to the Australian Wheat Board are treated as outlay items, rather than financing transactions as in the past. This brings the classification of these short-term advances into line with that accorded to other advances from the budget; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>purchases of land and existing buildings (including inter-departmental transfers for which a financial adjustment is made) are now treated as outlays rather than offsets to the proceeds from the sale of these assets under a receipts heading. This change permits gross outlays on these assets to be shown under the appropriate functional headings. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other conceptual changes in line with the principles set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts</inline> were also introduced. These changes relate mainly to the treatment of rents and business enterprise transactions and are indicated in the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin issued concurrently with the Budget documents. Overall, they do not have a very significant effect on the figures shown for total receipts and total outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The adoption of national accounting conventions implies that the receipts and outlay figures shown in the Statements attached to the Budget Speech relate, for the most part, to the net transactions of the budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important characteristics of the national accounting treatment shown in the Statements are as follows: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>The transactions of various Funds forming the Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, payments to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account are not shown as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure from that Trust Account is included. The aim is essentially to record the transactions between the budget sector and the rest of the economy. Allowance is, however, made for adjustments between functions arising from the transfer of existing assets where financial adjustments for these transfers are recorded; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>receipts derived from activities which are essentially of a governmental nature, involving regulation and compulsory payment, are normally treated as revenue items. This applies in particular to industry charges and levies, broadcasting and television licence fees, and fees and fines imposed by the courts. Other recoveries and repayments are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net outlay figures. For example, repayments of principal on advances to other authorities are offset against the corresponding advances under the same outlay heading. Bringing together the relevant outlays and recoveries or repayments makes it possible to see more readily the extent of financial resources which are directed through the budget to a particular activity. Taxes, compulsory charges, licence fees and the like are not regarded as being related to particular outlays but rather as being of a general revenue nature; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>the operating revenues of activities which are carried out as business-type enterprises are shown net of operating expenses as receipts items and hence do not appear in the outlay tables. The current operations of enterprises are thus reflected in the Budget Statements to the extent that they contribute to general budget revenues; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>finally, certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important of these are interest on loans raised by the Australian Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Limited. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading &#39;Public Debt Interest&#39;, while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. </para>

This Bill contains details of proposed appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1974-75 totalling $1,670,805,000 for expenditure on: The construction of public works and buildings; the acquisition of sites and buildings; advances and loans; items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure; grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution; and new policies not authorised by special legislation. Included in the above total is an amount of $75m as an advance to the Treasurer for the purposes set out in the Bill. The proposed expenditures in this Bill were dealt with as appropriate in my Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

            <para>- The preliminary report was prepared by the Committee at my request in order that a broad-brush indication of the Committee &#39;s views on some of the larger taxation issues could be available prior to the shaping of the 1974-75 Budget. In tabling it now I express the hope that the report will stimulate public discussion on the many major taxation issues with which it deals. In that connection I mention that between now and the end of this year the Treasury will be publishing its submissions to the Taxation Review Committee and that the full report of the Committee is expected to be published around the end of 1974. In the light of detailed examination of the Committee &#39;s preliminary report and, when it is received, the full report, and of the public discussion which will be stimulated by them, the Government will thereafter review its policies towards the taxation system as a whole. In tabling the preliminary report I express my appreciation of the quick and effective way in which the Committee, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Asprey, responded to my request for a preliminary report. </para>

          <para class="block">The Bill now before the House imposes a tax of 2c per litre on liquefied gas used for propelling road vehicles. The introduction of this tax was foreshadowed in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. The tax imposed by this Bill applies only to liquefied gas used in the propulsion of road vehicles. It does not in any way affect the bulk of liquefied gas which is used in the community for domestic and industrial heating, cooking and various other purposes. The use of liquefied gas in road vehicles has been increasing at a significant rate. Users of liquefied gas for vehicle propulsion, however, do not, at present, contribute to Government revenues, much of which is expended on road construction and maintenance. This tax will remedy this anomaly. </para>
          <para>The rate of tax proposed- 2c per litre- is almost exactly 40 per cent of the current rate of excise duty on petrol and is considered to be a rate which will minimise the erosion of petrol excise whilst not unduly inhibiting expansion of the use of gas for propelling road vehicles. The Government is aware of the high cost of establishing supply and distribution facilities for liquefied gas and of the need to be able to plan such expansion with confidence. For this reason the Government has decided that, for the next S years, the rate of tax payable on liquefied gas used in road vehicles, will be increased only on 50 per cent of any increases of petrol excise that may occur in that period. Tax will be payable on liquefied gas used in propelling a road vehicle by the person owning the gas immediately before such use. It will be paid monthly by users on the basis of returns of use submitted to Collectors of Customs. The Bill proposes that the tax will operate on and from a date to be proclaimed. A summary of the clauses of the Bill is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> referred in his Budget Speech to the need for higher Post Office charges than were previously proposed because of the Opposition&#39;s action in the Senate in July in deferring the increases which were to apply from 1 August, after the Opposition in this House voted for the Bill. The deferment of those increases to 1 October would mean that Post Office receipts in 1974-75 would be about $30m less than was anticipated from that source. </para>
          <para>As far back as the Premiers Conference of 7 June it was known publicly that the Post Office appropriation in the Budget would be held at last year&#39;s level of $385m. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> in the debate in the Senate stressed that there would be no increase in that allocation. The effect of deferment has to be either higher charges to cover the shortfall or a cut in the Post Office&#39;s capital investment program. The Opposition&#39;s action in the Senate has been strongly condemned from many quarters. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> at his Press conference on 30 July termed the deferment grossly irresponsible. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It seems the grossest irresponsibility for an Opposition which, when it was in Government knew this would have to be done, which has now had that knowledge re-inforced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Vernon&#39;s Royal Commission, now to say it will reject these charges. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The daily newspapers and the financial Press condemned the Opposition&#39;s action in equally strong terms. The &#39;Age&#39; editorial of 1 August said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Higher postal charges are not so much a pan of the Government&#39;s anti-inflationary program as a first step towards making the Post Office commercially viable . . . Significantly, the Opposition did not oppose the increased postal charges in the House of Representatives. Their rejection in the Senate must be seen as a tactical manoeuvre based on opportunism rather than a valid objection based on reason or principle. One way or another, the public will have to pay. </para>

          <para class="block">On 3 1 July the editor of the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39;, under the heading &#39;B. M. Snedden&#39;s Seven Cent Heroics&#39;, wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Every so often opportunism can be dressed up to pass muster as considered rational policy. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> was the man who campaigned on the necessity of pruning the expenditure side of the Commonwealth Budget. It is almost totally inconsistent for him to espouse this and at the same time scheme to prevent the Government increasing postal charges. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government is not prepared to vary its previous decision and allocate more from the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the expense of our priority programmes in the fields of education, welfare and health. It is generally accepted that the Post Office should finance a significant proportion of postal and telecommunications expansion. (Quorum formed) The report of the Vernon Commission recommends that SO per cent of fixed asset expenditure should be financed from internal sources- profits and provisions for depreciation and long service leave. This enables the Post Office to meet demand for service at a higher level than would be possible if finances were restricted to borrowings available through the Budget. If borrowings through the Budget were increased, the percentage of telecommunications capital investment which is internally financed would fall well below 50 per cent. </para>
          <para>After close study, the Government has also decided that it would not be appropriate to cut Post Office capital investment by some further $30m and let existing telephone applicants increase by 40,000 to 163,000. That would mean a telecommunications engineering construction program 6 per cent below the 1973-74 level of effort. It would obviously require substantial retrenchments in the Post Office&#39;s 18,000 capital works staff and in the telecommunications manufacturing industry staff of 20,000 where skilled resources have been built up over many years. </para>
          <para>In considering how some $30m should be raised from extra higher charges in 1974-75, the Government considered that the postal service with its huge losses must bear a significant part. The basic postage will therefore be increased to 10c with other increases in associated charges which I will outline shortly. On the telephone side, it seemed completely inequitable for the residential subscriber to pay more directly because of the Opposition&#39;s action and it was therefore decided that the remaining shortfall should be borne by business subscribers. Business telephone rentals will be increased to $85 and there are also some further increases in telex call charges and rentals, for installation and removal fees for miscellaneous telephone facilities and for telegraphic code addresses. Otherwise the increases are identical with those included in the previous Bills. Full details of all the charges are given in the schedule circulated to honourable members but the major items are: </para>
          <para>Telephone service connection fees are being increased from $60 to $80 for new applicants where new plant is necessary and from $30 to $40 where an existing subscriber moves to another address and new plant is required, to raise $6m in 1974-75. </para>
          <para>Government and business rentals will increase by $30 to $85, instead of $75 previously proposed, and residential and other rentals by $10 to $65, to raise $58m in 1974-75. </para>
          <para>The local call fee will rise from 4.75c to 6c, but this will not be reflected directly into trunk call charges. Day time calls will rise by between 3.5 per cent and 5.3 per cent only, except for those over 645 kilometres where the increase is 26 per cent. Night rates are being reduced by 3 per cent to 40 per cent, with the shortest distance calls up to 50 kilometres costing only 6c- that is the local call fee- for each three minutes. Variations in call charges will raise $3 lm in 1974-75. </para>
          <para>The basic postage for standard and nonstandard postal articles will be 10c and 11c, instead of 9c and 10c previously proposed. These higher increases will be reflected into charges for heavier weight items, bulk presorted mail, Category &#39;C registered publications, householder mail, overseas mail, airmail and priority paid mail. Variations in all postal charges will raise $43m in 1 974-75. </para>
          <para class="block">The total extra receipts in 1974-75 from all increases is $146m. This is the same amount which would have been raised if the deferred proposals had applied from 1 August. A substantial amount of justification for the individual variations was given when these measures were first announced and it is not necessary to repeat it because it is readily available. In addition, more complete financial information is available in the annual Post Office White Paper which has been presented. It must be realised by the Opposition that the Government is determined to ensure that the costs of the Post Office are met by the users of the services. This is in line with the recommendations of the Vernon Commission, which saw the need for the Post Office to operate in a similar manner to other Government undertakings. Higher borrowings from the Treasury, year after year, are not the answer to the cost increases faced by the Post Office, and this Bill endeavours to correct the situation that has been accentuated by the Opposition&#39;s recent actions. I emphasise that but for these recent actions the basic postage paid by the Australian people would be 9c instead of the 10c now necessary; the telephone rental on business and government services would be $75 instead of the $85 they must now pay. The price of the Opposition&#39;s previous irresponsible decision is lc on every letter and $ 10 on every business telephone service. The people of Australia and the business community in particular should remember that. </para>
          <para>The date of effect of the variations to charges in the Bill is 1 October. The Opposition has had some 3 months to study them. It can consider them in the context of the Budget. It can now see the implications of its previous decision. What is needed is expeditious action to pass this legislation to avoid the Post Office being affected yet again. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Post and Telegraph Rates Act in respect of postal and telegraph charges. Another Bill will amend the Post and Telegraph Act and associated regulations. Certain miscellaneous charges will be adjusted by administrative action. I commend the Bill to honourable members and seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table relating to the adjustment of charges for postal and telecommunication services. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill is complementary to the amendments to the Post and Telegraph Rates Act 1902-1973 which I have just introduced. In order to implement the changes of which I have spoken in conjunction with the Post and Telegraph Rates Act amendments, it is necessary to make certain amendments to the Post and Telegraph Act and to the postal regulations, the telephone regulations, the telegraph regulations and the radiotelephone exchange service regulations. </para>
          <para>As mentioned previously, this Bill also makes changes to the Post and Telegraph Act which are necessary to permit the introduction of a Post Office courier service. Initially, the courier service, to cater for the special need for a messenger service for urgent articles, will be provided in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra, with subsequent extension to the other capital cities. The present privately operated ventures meet a substantial and growing customer need but are close to the traditional areas of postal operations. It is, therefore, appropriate for the Post Office to provide a courier service and it is expected that this will be a profitable operation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para class="block">The honourable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> referred in his Budget Speech to the Government&#39;s decision to abolish broadcast listeners&#39; and television viewers&#39; licences. This BUI contains the necessary amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1973. This is an important decision which will place Australia with Canada as the only two major countries whose governments provide a national service without charging radio and television set owners an annual licence fee. It will free close to 3.5 million Australians, including 500,000 pensioners, of any future liability for licence fees which range up to $26.50 per annum. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that the national broadcasting and television service should not be regarded as resembling a business undertaking in which receipts are related to expenditure. The national service provides an information, educational, cultural and entertainment service to the community. The Government believes that all people should have equal access to such services and it is, therefore, proper for the costs of these services to be a charge on the community as a whole through taxation. Licence fees have been a means of requiring radio and television set owners to make a contribution towards expenditure on the national broadcasting and television service. The contribution has been substantial. When licence fees were increased in 1968 and 1971 by the Liberal-Country Party Government, the result was that about 75 per cent of expenditure was recovered through fees. This practice has resulted in annual fees of $26.50 for a combined broadcasting and television licence; $19 for a television licence; and $8 or $4.25 for a broadcasting licence, depending on the zone. If this practice had been followed today, a combined licence fee of at least $40 would be appropriate, an increase of about 50 per cent, with a fee of about $50 for colour television sets. </para>
          <para>Not only have the licence fees been substantial, but they have represented a poll tax applied uniformly throughout the community. Its burden is, therefore, relatively heavier on lower income earners than on the more affluent. This regressive aspect is accentuated by the requirement of only one licence for all receivers in any one dwelling the affluent are more likely to be multiple set owners. Paying for the service from taxation collections which reflect the capacity to pay principle is more equitable. The licence fee has also become a relatively expensive tax to collect. The cost of administering the scheme in 1973-74 was $3.4m, representing almost 5 per cent of the total licence revenue, compared with a cost equal to about 1 per cent for income tax. Payment for the national service through the taxation system rather than by a special tax is, therefore, much more efficient. </para>
          <para>A considerable proportion of the expenses of administering the scheme was incurred in policing the licence provisions of the Act. Despite the active work of some 80 licence inspectors, evasion has been a substantial problem. It has been estimated that revenue of about $llm annually is lost through evasion, and of course evasions increase as fees rise. Last year, 23,000 people were prosecuted for not having licences. I wish to express appreciation of the staff of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, past and present, who have been responsible for establishing, operating and policing the licensing system. Often the unpopularity of licences has been taken out on them personally by licensees and non-licensees, but they have gone about their work with commendable efficiency and good grace. The existing staff, numbering 247, are being advised that there will be no retrenchments and that they will be placed in other areas as vacancies arise and after any necessary retraining in departmental time and at departmental expense. </para>
          <para>There will be no refunds on current licences. However, in the case of licensees who have renewed, in advance, licences expiring after 17 September, a refund will be made as soon as practicable after this legislation is adopted. Any payments received subsequently for licences expiring after 1 7 September will also be returned to the payee. The abolition of the licensing system will cost the Government an estimated $50m in 1974-75 and $67m in a full year. This takes account of the saving in administrative costs. Refunds on unexpired portions of current licences would have cost the Government a further $30m in 1974-75 and made abolition too expensive to be contemplated. All licensees have escaped future payments and that should be a cause for considerable satisfaction. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para>- I want to talk about an incident which happened here in Canberra recently on the occasion of a visit by some school children. I made arrangements for the fifth and six grade school children from St Joseph&#39;s School, East Maitland, to visit the Federal Capital. On 3 September, while they were here, they went to Red Hill and there they purchased at a store a number of articles entitled &#39;The Merry Monk with Fun Raising Action&#39;. The instructions on the box containing the article that these children purchased were as follows: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>Place figure on flat surface, press head down with finger and watch the action. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">By following these instructions a reproduction of a penis was projected from the monk&#39;s habit. One of these articles was on display in this position. Despite the fact that on the box containing the article it was stated quite clearly &#39;this article is not- ( 1 ) to be sold to a person under the age of 18 years; (2) to be demonstrated in public; (3) to be sold through the post as a mail order item or to a person who has not first had an opportunity to inspect it fully,&#39; two of these were sold by women members of the staff at the store- one to an 1 1-year old boy and another to a 12-year old boy. </para>
        <para>While leaving the kiosk, Father Mahan, who was in charge of the boys, noticed them with the articles. Having observed these articles on display and consequently knowing their immoral nature, he confiscated them and returned to the kiosk, accompanied by the boys, so that they could identify the persons who were responsible for the sale. He spoke to the woman in charge, who was also one of the persons identified by the boys, about the sale of these articles to minors. She admitted selling them and offered the excuse that she told the boss that he should not have purchased them in the first place. She offered to refund the money, $1.99; but Father Graham refused at that stage because, feeling as strongly as he did about the spread of pornographic material, especially the easy accessibility that minors have to this material, he considered that the matter needed to be taken further. Therefore, he requested the name and telephone number of the owner and the names of those involved in the sale, with the intention of taking this matter up with the Australian Capital Territory Police for the purpose of prosecution. On leaving Red Hill he went to police headquarters and reported the incident. He spoke to Inspector Mills who, whilst sympathetic towards his feelings on what had happened, felt that very little could be done because of the laxity of the law in the Australian Capital Territory regarding such material. Nevertheless, Father Mahan requested Constable Hubbard to investigate the matter and he requested an interview with the constable on the following day, Wednesday, 4 September, after 3 p.m. It was after this that he first contacted His Grace, the Archbishop of Canberra-Goulburn, to inform him of what had happened and what action had been taken. </para>
        <para>On Wednesday, 4 September, at approximately 4 p.m. he again visited police headquarters and spoke to Constable Hibberd. The constable handed Father Mahan an envelope containing $2 as a refund for one of the articles he had left with Inspector Mills the previous day. The other article is still in Father Mahan &#39;s possession. The constable went on to tell Father Mahan that he had spoken to the owner of the kiosk who had already removed the demonstration model from the showcase and had locked the display case containing the articles in question.  His  excuse for the sale to the children in question was that the staff were new to the job. The impression given by the constable was that the matter was now closed. Again Father Mahan was not prepared to accept this and repeatedly asked what further steps would be taken. The result was that the constable excused himself to refer the matter to another inspector. </para>
        <para>A short time later Inspector Broom by met Father Mahan, who repeated the details to the inspector. Like the previous inspector, Inspector Broom by felt that little could be done. However, Father Mahan persisted with the request that further action be instigated. Inspector Broom by agreed with Father Mahan that the article was obscene and that it had been sold to minors; that is, persons under 16 years of age. His attitude was still that nothing could be done because of the present law and he further pointed out that before the police could proceed with a prosecution in the area of pornography a magistrate&#39;s approval had to be obtained to seize the material in question. This material would then have to be submitted to that magistrate for his assessment of its pornographic content. If he agreed that the material was pornographic and prosecution was warranted it would be necessary to submit the case to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department for its approval or rejection before proceeding with prosecution. It would seem that this is where the crux of the problem lies. </para>
        <para>Again Father Mahan persisted by asking what would be the inspector&#39;s attitude if the object had been presented as a policeman or the Prime Minister. The inspector agreed with the validity of Father Mahan &#39;s point of view and went even further to agree with his statement that as a Christian leader in the community if he did not take a stand on such matters as this, how could he expect other citizens to take a stand. In a word, the existence of the present approach in law has come about because of the people&#39;s apathy. In the whole of this matter Father Mahan continued to stress the one aspect of minors being exposed to and able to purchase pornographic or obscene material. He pressed this approach further with the inspector by stating that further action would be taken by him. Finally, having checked the statutes of the law, the inspector informed Father Mahan that the articles purchased would be regarded as pornographic and obscene and that the children in question were minors under the law. He then decided to request a full statement from the constable who first investigated the matter and also to prepare a report on it himself, both of which reports he would submit to the Commissioner for his decision on any further action. That is where the matter rested. </para>
        <para>Might I add that this pornographic material has come into this country from Hong Kong. If such items are on sale at a store here at Red Hill I venture to say that there would be hundreds of thousands of these merry monk items spread throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It is certainly a degrading insult to the priesthood- men who are involved in spreading Christianity in this country- to be defamed in such a manner. I think this matter should be taken further. It should be taken to the Attorney-General. Young children in this country are being subjected to pornographic material of this nature which is coming from foreign countries such as Hong Kong. I think that something ought to be done about it and it should be stopped. </para>
        <para>I congratulate Father John Mahan of the East Maitland St Joseph&#39;s School for his action in this matter. He has gone to a lot of trouble. I hope his efforts will be rewarded. I trust that my speech tonight exposing this matter will receive consideration in the right quarters. This matter was featured on the national network&#39;s &#39;This Day Tonight&#39; last Thursday night. It was brought to light by none other than Richard Carlton of the Aus.tralian Broadcasting Commission. I hope that the complaint made by Father John Mahan is investigated to the full and that pornographic material of this nature is prevented from entering Australia </para>

          <para>- I wish to raise the matter of the supply of fuel, particularly to country areas. In the last 18 months or 2 years country areas have had a serious problem each time there has been an industrial dispute in the fuel industry. This has had a detrimental effect on many industries, not only in my electorate but in aU country areas. Only recently I heard something which was most disturbing, and that was that a man who owns a petrol station had additional tank capacity installed at his station to build up a reserve so that in the event of any industrial difficulties he would have sufficient fuel to carry on for some time. I Will not mention his name because of the danger of victimisation. As his station is on one of our main highways, it would be of tremendous advantage to him and to the travelling public if he had additional supplies. When the supplies arrived he said that he wanted a certain amount of petrol. He was told that he could receive only X gallons. He said that the amount was not sufficient for him, that he had additional tanks installed so that he could carry extra supplies. He was told by the driver that he would receive a certain amount and that was all, that if he did not want to take it, he may not get any supplies. Upon contacting the oil company he was informed that this was the situation, that the driver was one of the top union men and that, literally if the driver said that he would get only a certain amount of petrol, that was the situation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think there are 2 points in this matter. Firstly, the refusal to supply extra petrol impinges upon the freedom of the individual- a man in business -to obtain the supplies he desires and needs. Secondly, it places the transport sector in a serious position because if supplies can be held down to a certain level and if there is a strike the unions have a greater opportunity to hold the public at ransom. I remember not so long ago in this Parliament the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes saying something to which more people in Australia ought to have given attention. The words of that distinguished gentleman were that if the left wing of the communist unions obtained control of the power union, the transport union and the supply union it could bring this country to its knees. With the industrial disputes in the supply and transport areas we have seen this almost happening. </para>

            <para>- As my friend, the honourable member for Darling Downs, has said, in many instances the disputes have been encouraged by the present Government. I think the situation I have outlined really needs looking at. It is said that the oil companies were using stand-over tactics. This situation was brought about by stand-over tactics by a union organiser. I really think the matter should be investigated. The Minister for Transport might be well advised to look at the situation so that in both the industrial field and the transport field country areas at least are not penalised any more as they have been over recent months. In more than one area in my own electorate industry was affected because it was not able to get distillate. The supply of fuel is important in any area but in country areas it is a great deal more important. I would suggest that the Minister look at the situation to find out the truth and do something to help country areas. </para>

          <para>-On 15 May 1973, on behalf of the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gorton)</inline> I moved an amendment to the Cities Commission Bill to omit a clause and to substitute other words. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> accepted the amendment on behalf of the Government. The purpose of the amendment was to increase by two the number of persons on the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission to allow the appointment of 2 persons with a specialised and expert knowledge of preservation and conservation of the environment. I was prompted to take an interest in this matter because of its importance to the State of South Australia and the towns I represent in that State downstream on the Murray River from Albury-Wodonga, in relation to conservation, the various aspects of the ecology of the river, and pollution. It was important to put someone on that advisory committee to look after the possible pollution of the River Murray downstream from Albury-Wodonga. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>My audience tonight is not exactly great. I notice that my friend, the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> is the sole backbencher present on the Government side. A latecomer has now entered the chamber. Of course, the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> has to be here. The importance of the action I took, to my electorate and indeed to the whole of South Australia, was that it was an attempt to ensure that in the future, when half a million people may be living in Albury-Wodonga, the quality of water downstream from that point will have specialised attention and care with the appointment of 2 environmentalists to look after possible pollution. I think it is absolutely correct to say that if half a million people live in an area nothing much can really be done to control pollution downstream. Although 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the total water requirements of South Australia come from the Murray, the State and- if one will forgive the comment- more importantly the towns downstream which I represent, have no protection built into any indenture agreement with the Commonwealth relating to the quality of water that will in future flow downstream from Albury-Wodonga and on which the State of South Australia is becoming more and more dependent. </para>
        <para>That was the reason behind my interest in the amendment. As I said, the Parliament, not just one or two people, accepted the amendment. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development, on behalf of the Government, said that he wanted to co-operate with the Opposition, and he agreed to accept the amendment I moved. Though I had described Professor Walsh as coming close to meeting this general description, the Minister pointed out that perhaps Professor Walsh should be described more accurately as being more than just close to meeting this description. We all departed extraordinarily happy. Everyone agreed that Parliament had done a good thing and we waited with interest to see what the Government did in appointing 2 persons who had specialised and expert knowledge in the preservation and conservation of the environment. </para>
        <para>Some time later the Minister made 3 appointments. My arithmetic does not seem to be quite correct, so I must imagine that one member of the Advisory Committee to the Cities Commission had resigned in the meantime. The Press release that I have before me is dated not 15 May 1973 but 6 December 1973, some 6 months later. The Minister appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Anne</inline> Gorman, a social worker and assistant lecturer at the Riverina College of Advanced Education at Wagga Wagga. Secondly he appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCartney, chairman</inline> of the Development Corporation of New South Wales and assistant general manager of Peters vil le Australia. I hope that the House will note that neither of those persons could exactly be described as being an expert in the field of the environment or conservation. </para>
        <para>But a problem is added to the situation when we consider that after Parliament had accepted this amendment- after the Minister, on behalf of the Government, had accepted it- the Minister then appointed a person named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Mundey, a conservationist and Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation. I hope by now that the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> who is sitting at the table will begin to perceive the problem that exercises my mind. In all sincerity and honesty, on behalf of this side of the chamber I moved that 2 persons who had specialised and expert knowledge of preservation of the environment and conservation be added to the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission for the very purpose that I have stated to the House tonight. But what have we got? We have got a bosom friend of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development from the far Left of the Australian political spectrum, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Mundey, appointed to one of 2 positions that Parliament said- not only the Minister said it- should conform to the description of a person who was expert in the field of the environment and conservation. Instead of 2 such persons being appointed, we have appointed one person who in my judgment does not conform to the description that Parliament gave to the Minister and which the Minister accepted. </para>
        <para>I suppose that it is not for me to become political or anything like that in the adjournment debate, but it seems to me that bosom pal relationships can go far enough in this matter. If the Minister is buddy-buddy with Jack Mundey, that is his business, but I maintain that the Minister has not done the right thing by a decision of this House. There have not been 2 experts in environment and conservation appointed to the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission. Anyone who tried to justify the position in that way would be guilty of great hypocrisy. That is the present position. We have got, I think, the present Treasurer of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation as representing, might I say, one-third of the Parliament&#39;s decision to appoint to this important Advisory Committee 2 people who were competent in the fields of the environment and conservation. The Minister has met the request of Parliament by one-third. As the person who moved the amendment I think that I am entitled to ask what has happened to the other two-thirds. Three extra appointments have been made in complete contempt, as I see the position, of Parliament which accepted this amendment on 15 May 1973. 1 do not know how honourable members opposite could justify the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mundey</inline> in relation to the description that I have already given to the House. I suppose they will say that he interested himself in environmental matters in relation to strikes against green belt projects and other building problems in the State of New South Wales. </para>

To be quite proper I should have done so and I apologise to the Minister for not having done so.

I think that needs an answer. I would be very interested if the Special Minister of State, who is sitting at the table and who seems to be the Minister for all things, at all times and in all places, could answer me. </para>

            <para>-I do not need to talk about the leaks. One matter that comes to mind about the defence situation is that I understand that under the control of the Public Service Board-the new head of the Department of Defence is not now totally under the control of the civil service- we find that retired staff or retired gentlemen have been enlisted in the reserve forces. They are referred to as the retired list. They have now all been included in the reserve forces. An interesting situation arose in the Department of Defence the other day when it was looking for an expert in, I think, the linguistic field. It called on a chap who had retired some time ago and asked him whether he would be interested in working for the Government. He said that he would be delighted to do so but that at 92 years of age he felt that he was a little too old. That is the situation in our defence forces today. We are having to call on people who are 92 years of age to come to our assistance when it is needed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The growing list of officers retiring from the defence forces must be causing great problems for the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> and the Department in general. After all, many of the officers who are retiring from the defence forces are retiring not because of their age but because it is time for them to get out. They realise that there is no longer any future in the defence forces system, which is breaking down in every direction. </para>
        <para>One of the defence areas that has been brought forward for discussion is the purchase of tanks from the United States of America. It was brought forward by the Minister earlier in the year. Therefore I feel that I should be allowed to speak on it. It is very interesting to note that the tanks which are being purchased are being manufactured wholly in the United States of America. The reason for this is that the United States of America can provide the tanks at a cut rate. One wonders why they have to produce them at a cut rate. Apparently the United States Government has ordered that in no circumstances are the workings of the factory concerned to be reduced. The factory has to be kept going irrespective of whether there is sufficient work for it. The United States Government is therefore chasing around the world looking for orders to keep its own industries going. Should we not perhaps look at the parallel situation in our own country? Here we have a situation in which we are badly in need of work for our munitions and ordnance factories. It is no good saying that we could not manufacture these tanks. Our expertise in this field was shown during World War II when we were required to manufacture the tanks that we used. The end product was considered to be greatly superior to the English tank. The fire power was greater than that of other tanks in the field at the time. One is well aware that Australia has the necessary expertise to produce quality work and ability to produce the goods. Why is it that these tanks are being purchased overseas? If it is good enough for the United States Government to subsidise factories in that country in order to retain employees in their jobs, surely this socialist Government that purports to be so dedicated to providing full employment would be quite within its rights to subsidise our munitions factories to the extent of maintaining jobs for employees there and also the jobs of employees in private factories which supply extra parts. It appears that the Government is going off half-cocked in relation to defence procurements. Australian factories could provide the manufactured items and as a consequence also provide employment for people in Australia. </para>
        <para>This situation should be carefully looked at. It is an intolerable situation and it will, of course, continue because we will need other defence equipment and obviously the Government will purchase it from overseas. </para>
        <para>The same position exists in relation to unemployment in other fields. Let me refer to the matter of imported goods. I have raised this point before. Have honourable members noticed how quickly the Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> has raced into the House to announce reduced tariff cuts and increased quotas to allow an onrush of imported goods into this country? We heard this morning one honourable member opposite ask a question about why the reductions on these goods were not being passed on to the public. The important question which he should have asked is: &#39;Why is it that such a large quantity of these goods is being allowed into this country thereby creating massive unemployment in the textile industries?&#39; we are faced today with massive cuts in employment in the textile industries. Everywhere one goes within his own electorate or even outside it one sees growing unemployment. Every day in the newspapers we read of textile industries in trouble, and the problem is growing. No action is being taken by this Government to protect the industries. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Overseas Trade made a statement that there was adequate protection. He said that there was provision to assist industries that got into trouble due to the tariff cuts. This is not true. There are no funds available- I have checked this out- to allow an industry to carry on. The only assistance that is provided is that when a company folds up it can get some asset revaluation through the Government. I am sure that is a great help to a local industry that is about to be closed down and its employees put out of work. Perhaps the Government will offer some expert advice on how such a company might be able to continue. You cannot continue in business when the article that you manufacture is more expensive at the factory level than the article that comes in from overseas or when you find that goods from overseas are being sold with a profit margin- as the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> said-of 200 or 300 per cent and are still cheaper at that price than the actual factory price of goods in this country. </para>
        <para>If the Government is really concerned about this matter and is not dedicated to the obvious pursuit of trying to close down textile industries in this country because it considers them to be redundant and propped up, it is about time it took some positive action by cutting back on the quantity of imports into this country. The Minister has said that under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade we cannot reduce the amount of imported goods because the agreement involves other countries. But we do have a right under our tariff protection laws to reduce the quantity of imported goods under the quota system and we should introduce restrictions. The Minister is not taking any steps at all to protect adequately the working people of this country or to protect the industries in this country. The position may have been satisfactory when adequate employment was available throughout the metropolitan areas of Melbourne and Sydney and when an industry closed down the employees could walk to another job and get it without any worries. But those days have gone, and they have gone in a very short space of time. The Minister must indeed be starting to wonder, or worry, what is the result, what will happen, because the horse has galloped on him. He cannot afford for factories to close down now. The trade unions are starting to complain to him about it. I am wondering just what steps he will take to overcome this drastic situation. It is quite obvious he is in a cleft stick. He has either to back down to his Asian friends and allies- and the redder ones further up- or he has to back down to the trade unions, one or the other. I think that ultimately it will be a good test of power, and we will see who really runs this Australian Government or some of its Ministers, whether they are controlled by the overseas forces or by the trade unions. The whole of this country will be waiting in eager anticipation to see which side wins this battle, which side will provide the end result to the benefit of Australia. If there is to be a result it must be to make our industries viable to allow our industries to go on. There is one thing that the Australian Labor Party has always overlooked: That in its desire to socialise industry and to push the wage systems up it forgets that without industry there are no jobs for those who wish to be employed. </para>

          <para>- I did not hear all of the speech made by the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier)</inline> but I heard sufficient relating to the Government&#39;s decision to purchase tanks overseas for me to appreciate that he has, as in most other subjects, a complete lack of knowledge and understanding of this matter. The honourable member raises a subject about which the previous Government ought to apologise to this nation, for its complete neglect for not making a decision that ought to have been made long ago to replace the Centurion tanks now in this country. As I pointed out to the House some short time ago, the last tanks ordered for in Australia were ordered by the last Labor Government. It has taken the new Labor Government to replace those tanks. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Of course the honourable member is on very weak ground, and obviously he has no understanding of the situation. In point of fact he is suggesting that we ought to build the tanks in Australia. That may be a very commendable suggestion, but the honourable member ought to look at the economics of the proposition. I have proposed that we should replace the Centurion tanks which, as I have just pointed out to the House, are about 25 years old and therefore are past their life. The cost of maintaining these tanks in the long term would be much greater than it would be to replace them, quite apart from the fact that they are no longer regarded as satisfactory equipment for the defence inventory of Australia. The honourable member ought to understand, when he talks about the United States of America and the tanks built there- he is referring of course to the M60-that no decision has been made by this Government. It has 2 options; either to purchase the M60 from the United States of America or to purchase the West German Leopard. When I made my statement on the subject I said that I would be making further inquiries from both the United States of America and West Germany to ensure that we get the best buy it is possible to get for Australia. That means not only to acquire a tank suitable for the Army&#39;s requirements but indeed also to acquire a tank under terms and conditions that would provide the best tank possible in offset arrangements for Australia. It is only in these circumstances and only in this way that it would be possible for this nation to replace the Centurion tanks. The honourable member suggests that we should have the expertise in Australia to build the tanks. But of course what he is proposing is that we set up in Australia the expertise and equipment to build the first order of 53 tanks. I am sure the honourable member would appreciate the cost involved in providing all of the equipment and the expertise that would be required to build 53 tanks only. That may be only the first pan of the order that is required by the Department of Defence and by the Australian Army. There may be more to follow. But to build 53 tanks and to set up all that is required to achieve that is beyond the capacity of this country. We would pay, not the amount we will pay for either the M60 or the German Leopard, but 3 times that amount and there would be no tanks to follow. The honourable member has no understanding of this problem. When he talks about the United States of America endeavouring to sell tanks around the world his statements may be true. But we will acquire 53 tanks. As I have already indicated to the House no decision has yet been made on whether we will acquire them from the United States of America because 2 types of tanks are under consideration. But those 53 tanks represent one month&#39;s production in the United States. </para>
        <para>How could we match that kind of production in this country in time of peace? There would be no further requirement to build tanks in Australia after we had set up all that would be required to build those 53 tanks. I think that the honourable member should do his homework in these matters. He often raises these subjects. But he has no understanding at all. If he has been advised by someone from the Department of Defence then he has been badly advised. </para>
        <para>Let me repeat for honourable members the position as it stands at this time. I have inspected both types of tanks. There has been a full evaluation by experts from my Department of both the M60 and the German Leopard tank. No decision has yet been made because, as I have said frequently in this House and publicly, whatever equipment we require for the defence forces of Australia we will ensure that it is acquired under the best possible terms and conditions. It will not be only a question of whether that item of equipment is the most suitable for the defence forces but also there will be the guarantee that there is a maximum amount of flow-back to this country in terms of expertise and offset arrangements. That is exactly what is being done at this moment. </para>
        <para>Let me indicate to the honourable member what can happen in these circumstances. The previous Government, formed by the Party to which the honourable member belongs, decided to build 3 destroyers in Australia. Based on 1972 costs the DDL program would have cost $335m. Obviously there would have been an escalation of costs. Before the program was on the drawing board the figure was $335m. It would be difficult to estimate the cost of those 3 destroyers in 1975 or 1976 when the drawings would have been completed. It would not have been $335m but probably closer to $500m for the 3 destroyers. When I investigated the program myself, I found that only 25 percent of those 3 destroyers were actually to be built in Australia. The rest of the destroyers was coming from overseas. That indicates that the honourable member has a complete lack of understanding of the problems involved in defence procurement in this country. </para>
        <para>I am satisfied that what the Australian Government intends in terms of its program for the procurement of tanks is the right decision. A decision will be made by April 1 975. Those tanks will provide not only an overdue replacement for the Centurion tanks but also the most modern equipment for the Australian armed forces. The proposal is to purchase 53 tanks as a first order. I think that we will be getting those tanks under the best terms and conditions which this country could hope to obtain from another country. Of course, in these circumstances the honourable member - </para>

            <para>- Despite the interjection from the honourable member he obviously has no knowledge of this subject at all. It would be completely beyond the capacity of Australian industry to provide the expertise, as I have said, and the equipment to build 53 tanks and then to stop. No industry in Australia would be prepared to undertake an enterprise of that kind. The honourable member for Bendigo only displayed a lack of knowledge when he spoke tonight. He was on very weak ground, and I am sure that he will appreciate my point. The honourable member should understand that the tanks that will be acquired for the Australian Army will be the most modern that are available and that they will be acquired at a reasonable price and on a basis that will provide a maximum flow-back to this country in terms of offset arrangements and expertise. </para>
