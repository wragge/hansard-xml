            <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that differing views on the problems of the Austraiian economy by many of his Ministers and disagreement within Caucus have increased the confusion and added to the lack of confidence apparent in the Australian community? Will the Prime Minister concede that announcements made at Premiers Conferences, mini-Budgets and ad hoc decisions have given an impression of fragmentation and not consistency which he spoke about in the House yesterday? Will he inform me whether in his view progress can be made in future Caucus and Cabinet meetings on an overall policy for the Australian economy which his Cabinet can agree with and Caucus will support? If so, will the honourable gentleman inform the House whether he, as head of Government, will announce it as soon as possible? </para>

              <para>- Inquiries were instituted in regard to the land at Melton and Sunbury which was the subject of innuendo and aspersions by a leading metropolitan daily. The newspaper concerned made a suggestion to the effect that the land had been acquired on too expensive a basis. Inquiries have established that Housing Agreement funds were not used for the purpose of this land acquisition. The money used was an amount in excess of $1 Om which was the accumulation of surpluses arising from the sale  of  38,000 Housing Commission homes in Victoria over a period of years. The inquiries already have, obtained very useful information but I reget to. say that the Victorian Government has now intimated that it refuses to cooperate any further, particularly in respect of our request for documented information concerning the Victorian Valuer-General&#39;s valuation of the land acquisitions. In fact the Acting Premier of that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thompson,</inline> has communicated with the Prime Minister indicating his Government&#39;s unpreparedness to co-operate on that matter and the other outstanding issues with which the inquiry is concerned. One thing is certain: Although Housing Agreement funds might not have been used it is undoubtedly true that Housing Commission homes built at Melton and Sunbury will bear the cost of the land aquisition charges and if they were excessive, as has been claimed by the metropolitan daily, these will be reflected in rentals and in house sale prices. </para>

            <para>-  I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In his election policy speech he said that the Labor Party&#39;s child care program reflected the recommendations of the Australian Prc-schools Committee, the Australian Social Welfare Commission and the Priorities Review Staff. What recommendations had the Prime Minister received from the Priorities Review Staff before he delivered his policy speech? Will he table the report in which they were contained? Were the recommendations consistent with those contained in the report of the Social Welfare Commission which advocated an expenditure of $130m in the 1974-75 year? Did he make a promise which he knew he would not keep? What information, trends or other reports have become available in the last 12 weeks which caused him to renege on his promise so that those who relied on it now post him as a $100m defaulter? </para>

The Minister would be aware of the confusion that existed in the community during the recent election campaign following upon the alleged statements by the Leader of the Country Party in regard to world parity prices for oil. Can the Minister inform the House as to the effect of the implementation of such a policy on our overseas passenger carrier Qantas Airways  Ltd? </para>

              <para>-  Very good, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> If the price of Australian crude were brought up to world parity this would have an effect on shipping charges. It would at least double freight charges. It would cost the international airline Qantas approximately SI 9m a year. These are only some of its effects. Not only would it have those effects on the overseas freight rates of our international carrier but also it would have a similar serious effect on the freight charges and fares of our domestic airlines. It would need a considerable increase in fares to cope with it. The general overall effect on the economy of the increased costs outlined would have been disastrous. </para>

            <para>-  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the confidence he has expressed in the Australian Labor Party Government and the clear assurance that it will be the Government for the next 5 years and for many years after. I would be delighted to be in a position to indicate to him that there would not be any increases in the price of crude oil, but my crystal ball is not operating too well today as I am sure his is not. The question that was asked the honourable mem&#39;ber for Port Adelaide was directly as to what would have been the effect on the Australian economy and Qantas Airways Ltd if crude oil prices in Australia had been brought up to world parity as was advocated by the Australian Country Party in the recent election campaign. </para>

One is the sub judice rule you have correctly adverted to and the other concerns the privileges of this House and the entire Parliament. The sub judice rule is a matter for your discretion but the privileges of this House and the whole Parliament are of prime and basic importance.

            <para>- There are 2 PAL sets, one produced by Telefunken and the other produced through the agency in Japan. There is no essential difference in the 2 sets, but I think one should be careful of the PAL bypass system which is not as effective as the full PAL sets. In the course of the next 2 weeks we shall produce a buyers&#39; guide to <inline font-style="italic">colour</inline> television sets. This will set out in detail the technical qualities of the sets. In that sense we are taking every step to ensure that the interests of the consumers in Australia are fully protected. </para>

            <para>- I myself have derived some diversion from reading some newspaper articles on this subject. I am sure that my hilarity is shared by all honourable members. Many pieces of formal dress such as white tie and tails or full morning dress can be regarded as appropriate for some formal occassions. I remember in the 1950s, when Parliament was opened, Ministers deemed it appropriate to wear striped trousers and short black coats. They did not, in fact, bring their bankers&#39; bowlers with them. Nevertheless, that was regarded as appropriate dress for Ministers on those occasions. I am glad to say that the opening of Parliament this time there was only one parliamentarian - a very distinguished one and for all too short a period a Minister - who deemed it appropriate to wear that dress. There are many overseas posts where it is incumbent upon diplomats to wear- </para>

              <para>- I am told that the honourable member for Barker and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> also wore that dress. I hope that honourable members will not take offence if I say that in that company the honourable member for Moreton was outstanding and memorable. I was saying that Australian diplomats have found it uncomfortable to wear the appropriate formal dress or the dress considered appropriate in some overseas countries. From time to time, discussion has taken place amongst Australian diplomatists concerning a simpler, more comfortable and perhaps Australian style of dress. Honourable members will have noticed that until the present  President  of France was sworn in it was usual for top personages in France to wear a white tie and tails during the daytime. Accordingly, many Australian diplomatists had to do so. They had to obey the dictates of protocol in that way. Some of them felt uncomfortable in having to do so. I would think that it is not accurate or fair to say that the Department of Foreign Affairs is itself designing or encouraging the wearing of a new uniform or form of dress. However, it is a matter which diplomatists do discuss from time to time. It is a matter that they have to live with. As I understand it the Secretary of the Department is receiving suggestions from the members of his staff who have to live with these habits in various countries. </para>

            <para>-  I preface a question to the Minister for Labor and Immigration by saying that I have read with interest the proposals that he has persuaded the Government to put to the forthcoming Moore conference on wage fixation. While expressing my sincere hopes for a successful outcome of the conference, I also note that the best informed economic commentators have stated flatly that his proposals will not work. Is he aware that the Opposition and myself in particular have put forward proposals in terms of a negotiated national guideline for wage and salary increases which could, in effect, embrace a form of indexation? Further, although some commentators have also poured a bucket on these proposals, as the Minister is a fair man, not to say a statesman, would he arrange for these views to be drawn to the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore, since presumably only parties to the original wage hearing are in a position to. present views themselves? </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Prime Minister. Is it definite Government policy to force a long term cut-back in the Australian textile industry? If so, why? If not, has the Government made a decision to reduce the 25 per cent tariff cut in relation to textiles on the basis that charity begins at home and that our workers deserve security of employment before overseas workers in this industry? Is the Prime Minister aware that with another 70 dismissals in Launceston yesterday nearly 700 textile workers have now lost their jobs in 3 textile mills in Launceston and George Town, where re-employment is almost impossible? </para>

            <para>-  I did answer a couple of questions on this subject last week. It is not the function of any government, it is not the intention of my Government, to force people to invest in any particular industry or to work in any particular industry. The fact is that for many years the textile industry has been proved to be one of decreasing attraction for investors and employees. If honourable gentlemen compare the statistics turned up by the censuses in 1966 and 1971 they will find that at a time of import quotas or embargoes or prohibitive tariffs the number of people working in this industry was consistently declining. I pointed out the other day - I believe it to be accurate - that if men or women lose their jobs in the textile industry in metropolitan areas they are able to find other employment. I also noted that there are some country towns - in particular, I said, in Victoria and the Hunter Valley - where at the present time alternative employment is not readily available for women who lose their jobs in the textile industry. In those circumstances I pointed out 2 things: First, it was not a proper economic priority to insist that Australians should have to pay more for textiles across the board in order to maintain employment in every possible textile factory; secondly, the best way to ensure employment in smaller centres was to increase and diversify the opportunities for employment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To meet the position of firms or individuals unable to find employment or disadvantaged by any tariff cuts, the Government has instituted the Structural Adjustment Board and the national employment and training system. These will provide a very much better avenue for investors, managers and employees than the textile industry is likely to provide in Australia. The Government is pursuing a policy of selected growth centres which will provide much better, more numerous and more varied opportunities for employment in Australia. We are carrying out these programs in co-operation with every State which is willing to co-operate. The Australian Government is co-operating with the Government of Tasmania in the Tamar district. A question for me to answer on this matter is on the notice paper. It is therefore not appropriate for me to go into greater detail about it. </para>
          <para>I do urge the honourable gentleman and other honourable gentlemen who speak about these matters not to lose sight of the wood for the trees. For various reasons, for many years there has been declining employment and investment in the textile industry. Economic rationality is not displayed or promoted by the arguments that were put in some sections of Australia, particularly in Victoria, during last May. For instance, one company in the La Trobe Valley came out with an inflammatory statement that it would have to put off 300 people unless the Australian Government were to restore the 25 per cent tariff cut and were to impose embargoes on textiles. That company had never employed more than 70 people. It received very good cover at the time. The Government wm do justice to firms and individuals disadvantaged by Government decisions or other inevitable economic circumstances. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration: Did the Australian Labor Party promise prior to its assumption of office on 2 December 1972 that there would be better industrial relations if it were to assume office? Is it a fact that a dispute between the NSW Grain Elevators Board and certain unions over a wage demand has already cost the wheat and coarse grain growers of NSW $20m in deferred exports and over $lm in demurrage? Is that indicative of the Government&#39;s inability to improve industrial relations? What action does the Government intend to take to achieve an immediate settlement of that dispute in order to avoid a possible loss of grain sales contracts overseas and export earnings at a time when our balance of trade is deeply in the red? </para>

            <para>- Yes, the Australian Labor Party did promise prior to the 1972 election that, if it were elected to government and if it were given the opportunity to put into effect its industrial relations policy by way of making certain amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it could and would introduce a better industrial relations climate. We have already made 3 separate attempts to give effect to that promise. Each time the attempt has been thwarted by the Senate. This week we have in this House again 2 pieces of legislation that would make it possible to give effect to that promise. The Opposition here has announced already that it proposes to persuade its colleagues in the Senate to reject those pieces of legislation again. It is utterly impossible for us to give effect to our promises while the Opposition obstructs the very vital legislation that is needed to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in order to make that possible. </para>

          <para>I will examine the details of the dispute to which the honourable member has referred. So far as I know or as at present advised, which is another way of putting it, the dispute is covered by the Industrial Commission of New South Wales and therefore does not come within the purview of the Australian Government. In any event, 1 should remind the honourable gentleman that the Government itself, as a government, under the Constitution has no power directly to intervene in these industrial disputes. The High Court of Australia has said time and time again - in no fewer than 166 different cases since 1904 - that the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament have no power directly to intervene in industrial relations. The only power we have is to pass legislation to give the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission limited powers to act. But they are very limited powers which means that even the Commission has very little power to do the things that are sometimes necessary. If we had the powers which the New South Wales State Government has - indeed which all the State governments have - in relation to industrial matters, then we could be blamed, 1 suggest, whenever we failed to exercise those powers to bring about settlements. That is not the case with the Australian Government. It has no power directly to intervene. Very often the Commission has no power to do the things that are needed. This particular case, so far as I am informed, is one which the honourable member ought to direct to the Premier of New South Wales. </para>

            <para>- I do not want to cover the ground adequately covered by the Prime Minister a few minutes ago when he answered a similar question. But it is a fact that for a long time now the Australian textile industry has been examined by the Tariff Board, which has been supported by Governments from both sides of politics in its mandate to examine Australian industry and to determine where it is efficient and economic. The Tariff Board has examined the textile industry on many occasions and has in fact found that it was very highly protected. Sometimes the effective rates were much higher than those just mentioned by the honourable member in his question. It is true that generally the textile industries in other countries are not as highly protected but in some countries they are. I think members of the House and the public have to take into acount all aspects of this question. It is not desirable from the community point of view to have employment in industries that are not efficient. Certain parts of the textile industry have not been efficient. Its capital investment is often too small and it has not kept up to date. It has not been able to afford to keep up to date and consequently in many of those places the productivity of the industry is low and the wages are low. I do not think it is a responsibility of a government from this side of politics to help maintain people in employment where the wages are low, where the working conditions are bad and where the hours are often very long, and that is often the consequence of maintaining these old and conservative industries. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to make the point that the whole of the textile industry is not like that. There are some very efficient parts of it. If honourable members examine the situation carefully they will find that the efficient parts of the industry are growing quite rapidly and that the inefficient parts are not growing. As the Prime Minister pointed out there, has been a decline in employment in the textile industry for a long time. That is a long term economic process that neither tariffs nor anything else can prevent or discourage. I think another thing has to be pointed out. In the year 1972-73 there was a considerable upsurge in demand for everything in Australia. I have often pointed out where this originated. In responding to that demand a good many industries - like some of the decentralised ones in Victoria - grew very rapidly. Most of the trouble is occurring in Victoria and in Launceston. In those places employment increased considerably and even- </para>

              <para>- Yes, even in the case of Wangaratta. I went through the Wangaratta Woollen Mills Ltd in recent weeks and I discovered quite a number of people who had not been employed there for very long and who had come from other parts of Victoria in response to advertisements for employees of different kinds. Consequently the employment level rose considerably. What has happened in a number of cases is that employment has come back to a more normal level and some of the unemployment that has occurred is part of that process. I think the need here is not to stick to rigorous conservatism and have a doctrine that every industry shall remain and that every person shall remain employed where he was last month or last year, whatever the conditions may be. What we need, and what a series of governments before this one was most deficient in, is a program to assist effectively people to be transferred to more productive employment. For 23 years nothing positive was ever done in this Parliament in that direction. Consquently, when this Government came to office after many years of deficiencies it has not been easy to establish in a short period of time the necessary machinery for the purpose. </para>

          <para>I refer, as the Prime Minister did, to the Structural Adjustment Board - that kind of legislation should have been before this Parliament 20 years ago - and the retraining scheme which is under the supervision of the Minister for Labor and Immigration. That sort of legislation should have been before this Parliament 20 years ago. If this legislation had been introduced we would now have the institutions and the trained people to do these jobs. But honourable members opposite have sat conservatively in response to every lobbying interest that has ever been able to come to this Parliament. Honourable members opposite have responded conservatively to them. A totally different attitude is needed and I think that has been revealed to the textile industry. I think that the most efficient and best parts of the textile industry in this country will grow  substantially, but I do not have a good view of the future for those in the industry who have not been able to keep up to date and who do not warrant a place in a modern economy. </para>

I  ask him to take notice of the Chair and its rulings. There was no personal reflection. Now that the personal explanation has been fully explained, I accept the personal explanation. But there was no personal reflection on the integrity of the honourable member for Sturt. </para>

        <para class="block">The effect of that amendment would have been to authorise the Reserve Bank to use, in respect of building societies, the powers contained in section 8 of the Reserve Bank Act. </para>
        <para>In drafting that amendment we had in mind a statement made to the Parliament by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> on 23 May 1973 when he said, in part: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It would be a very proper thing for this Parliament now to see that such basic financial institutions as building societies are equated much more in their operations to banks - that is, we should guarantee their security and in return they should pursue the public interest in their lending policies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This amendment falls short of the guarantee advocated by the Prime Minister. It does not equate with lender of last resort facilities. But it does - or would, had it been passed - provide the Reserve Bank with a capacity to assist building societies should the Bank consider it to be warranted. In expressing our gratification that the Government has accepted the amendments that were carried in the other place, we press the Government to give further consideration to this line of thought that we have advanced. </para>
        <para>One other amendment which was defeated in the other place, to which we attached considerable importance, was the amendment numbered 9. It sought to bring the operations under this Act under the scrutiny of this Parliament. By and large the Act is an enabling one. The Reserve Bank gives effect to it by regulation. We sought by this amendment to introduce the notion of the &#39;affirmative resolution&#39; by which regulations formulated by the Reserve Bank in pursuance of the Act would be brought before the Parliament. I would like to stress - I am sure that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> was aware of it - that there was no suggestion in the amendment that determinations under the regulations be so brought. If it were desirable for the Reserve Bank to give effect to a change of interest rates or a change of asset policy under a regulation which had been brought in and approved by the Parliament then that is a matter of a day to day determination. Perhaps, for instance, a certain group of companies is to be classified as a group and be subject to interest rate control. The regulation in the broad sense should be brought before the purview of both Houses. The Opposition presses the Government to give further consideration to the wisdom of these additional amendments which were moved by this side of the chamber. Again I express the gratification of the Opposition that the amendments carried in the other place have been accepted by the Government. </para>

          <para>- In supporting the motion that these amendments be agreed to, I want to make 2 points. The first is that this is one example in a long history of examples of the Australian Labor Government reasonably accepting amendments put forward by the Opposition. I point out that this is something new since the Australian Labor Government took office. I had 3 years in Opposition when reasonable amendments put up by the Labor Party in this place were merely overlooked, stamped on and given scant attention. I hope we will see in this Parliament for many years to come this recognition that all wisdom does not rest on the one side but that there are reasonable amendments and other experiences, even in the Opposition, which can affect legislation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second point I want to make is that we welcome the 11th hour conversion of the Opposition to a Financial Corporations Bill. Such legislation is something that the Labor Party has- been suggesting as necessary in this country for at least 20 years. It has been a tragedy since the Reserve Bank was set up to find just how many of our financial institutions were outside the ambit of the Reserve Bank&#39;s authority. This has created many anomalies in our institutions in this country. It has been a long, hard struggle with long, hard work by the officers of the Treasury &#34;and by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> himself, to whom I pay tribute. I am glad that this hard work has now come to the point when we will have an Act in this sphere. </para>

        <para>The amendments come from the Senate. They were moved by the Opposition there. They have changed the complexion of the Bill, in areas where they are effective, somewhat from what was proposed by the Government. Nonetheless, we believe we can still work with these amendments and strive to protect the contributors&#39; interests and at the same time, as we indicated was our intention at the time we brought the original Bill into the House, preserve the rights of the funds. The 2 things have to be balanced. There has been an imbalance in the past. Contributors&#39; rights were not being properly attended to. Accordingly we found it necessary to seek urgently, because of circumstances that erupted suddenly in the past several days, to alter the original amending Bill. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition is very pleased that the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has seen fit to co-operate with our suggestions, which were moved in the Senate and which we say will not only improve the machinery of the Bill but will also give further protection to the contributors to the Funds. The Opposition is also pleased to learn that the office bearers of the Funds have asked the Minister to see them. We are equally pleased that he has agreed to see them on Monday to try to allow sweet reason to prevail rather than the public confrontation which has taken place in the past. Once again I say that I hope those discussions will be conducted with the knowledge that this is a delicate situation, and also that they will be undertaken in private and not out in the public market place. </para>

          <para>- I would like to point out that the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> has brought some extraneous matters into this debate. The fact is that the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> offered some time ago to see the  chairman  of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and the  chairman  of the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia. Originally they sent a telegram indicating they were not prepared to see him. I would also like to point out that there was a complete distortion on the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s &#39;A.M.&#39; program yesterday morning about just this matter, which should have been corrected this morning. Two segments gave me the impression that the Minister was not prepared to see the  chairman  and that the Opposition had mediated and was bringing this about. I repeat the word &#39;distortion&#39; about this. Nevertheless I agree with the honourable member for Hotham to the extent that 1 am glad that agreement has now been reached between both sides of the Parliament about this measure in order to bring sanity to the situation and to produce negotiations between the parties. </para>

It is all very well for the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> to get somewhat up-tight at the suggestion that there is a more practical and reasonable way of carrying out a certain manoeuvre. There are far too many categories in the proposed schedule attached to the Bill. It is all very well for someone sitting in an office in far-away Canberra, removed geographically and demographically from the place where a decision should be made but using too many pigeon holes and trying to fit too many points of view into a certain position can lead to a waste of resources. </para>

        <para>It seems to me to be a far more practical proposition to allow people on the spot to decide how money shall or shall not be spent. Under the proposals in clauses 4 and 5 as outlined by the Minister a rigid rule has to be observed. Members of the Opposition prefer to look at this matter in a practical sense. We say that if money has been allocated and if people on the spot fee! at a given time that it is better to transfer this money from one project to another for the purpose of saving resources, manpower and material, and in the long run having the job completed in the quickest time at the lowest possible cost, it is better to have clauses 4 and 5 removed from the legislation to allow this practical solution to be effected. I fully support the amendment. </para>

The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> obviously is adopting standover tactics in saying: &#39;You will pass this Bill or 1 will withdraw it and deny the States any more money for roads&#39;. I believe this is a most arrogant attitude to a genuine attempt to try to amend the Bill to suit the requirements not only of State governments but also of local government which do not feel bound to have the Commonwealth Government tell them how to spend money they themselves raise. I think it grossly unfair to try to suppress opposition to bad principles contained in the Bill; to what <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> regard as bad legislation. Australia is supposed to be a civilised democratic country, not some banana republic or totalitarian dictatorship. I know the Minister lost his temper and was probably tired  last evening but that does not excuse him from spelling out an attitude- </para>

            <para>- In attempting to intimidate the Opposition into not pressing its amendments the Minister is intimidating State governments and hundreds of shire and municipal councils. It is absolutely unfair to say that the Opposition is opposed to attempts by the Government to upgrade the standards of our highways. I do not think anybody could, with any justification, oppose the national highways policy or program. But we object to the manner in which the Minister is endeavouring to achieve this objective and, even more importantly, to satisfy the policy and philosophical objectives of the Government - a policy objective to take control from the States and local government and to remove their powers to determine how they shall spend money they have raised by their own methods. This is money that as elected people they must account, for in their own right. </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para>The Minister and his bureaucracy in Canberra are to determine how local government bodies in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and </para>
        <para class="block">Queensland shall spend their money. In fact, this is an attempt to ride roughshod over State and local governments. I think that it is quite unpardonable for them to be told: &#39;You will do as you are told or else&#39;. I object very strongly to the Minister&#39;s outburst last night when he said: &#39;If you persist with these amendments to this Bill we will withdraw it and we will deny the States any access to funds&#39;. I do not think that is any way in which to discharge the Minister&#39;s responsibility in a federal system. In referendum after referendum the Australian people have upheld the principles of the federal system. How often has any government been able to go to the Australian people and get powers transferred from the States to the Australian Government? I think that is an indication that the Australian people are adhering to the principle of federalism. </para>
        <para>What the Government is saying, in effect, is that State and local governments cannot spend any of their money in their own way. Sure, they will be free to spend their own funds subject to the approval arrangements of the Commonwealth. Nowhere in the second reading speech is it explained in any detail at all what the Government intends to do. I regard it as an act of sheer deceit. It is no good coming into this House and saying that the Government has a mandate to take over the control of the expenditure on rural arterial roads, of money raised by State or local governments. The Government does not have a mandate for that, and it knows jolly well that it does not have a mandate for that, because if the Government thought that it had a mandate reference to that fact would have appeared in the second reading speech. This is an attempt to take over the roles of State and local governments in their areas of responsibility. It is the worst act of authoritarian tactics that we have yet seen in this Parliament. They are standover tactics that should be rejected by every fair-minded person. I regard it as an act of political thuggery. </para>
        <para>I do not think that many State Departments of Highways and Departments of Local Government, or indeed their Ministers, or many shire councils or municipalities around the countryside are happy with this arrangement. Do not try to say that we are opposed to a national highways program or a policy as such. Of course the States require money from the Commonwealth to assist them to upgrade their roads in order to try to avoid tragic loss of life on the roads. There is not a man sitting in this Parliament who would not subscribe to that policy. But what we are bitterly opposed to is the Commonwealth assuming that it has the right to tell State and local governments how they shall spend the funds that they raise in order to try to improve the services in their own areas. If the Minister will not reconsider the situation, I hope that there are in the Government men who will respond to some of the pressures that must be coming upon them from shire councils and local government bodies, because hundreds of shire councils and local government bodies happen to be in the electorates of members of the Labor Party, and they are opposed to the approach that is embedded in this clause of the Bill. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support the clause and to oppose the amendment. What the amendment proposes to do, of course, as the honourable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> has said, is to say: &#39;Look, here is a quantity of money for the Australian Government. You go for your life and spend it as you wish.&#39; But let us reflect on that. If we could see some performance by the people to whom the money is being allocated such an attitude would be justified and there might be some argument for it; there might be some valid reasoning in the argument put forward by the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> But let us have a look at the track record. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The traffic chaos in the inner suburban areas of Melbourne reflects the attitude of the State Government to those areas. One sees the way in which the underground railway project has developed. Certain people will reap a harvest from the money paid by taxpayers, not necessarily just in the inner suburban areas of Melbourne but also throughout the State of Victoria. The inner suburban areas are the parking lots for the central business district of Melbourne. I wonder who is in control. The Hamer Government pruned back the monumentally wrong recommendations contained in the engineer&#39;s report of the Transportation Committee, regarding it as clearly an error of judgment. The Hamer Government announced prior to the previous State election that it would prune back the amount of S2,2O0m to be spent on freeway construction. At the present moment the Country Roads Board is continuing to plan and design many of these concrete monstrosities that are tearing the inside out of a beautiful city, and it is doing so with total disregard for the people of Melbourne and without reflecting on the fact that surely people ought to be put before motor vehicles in a city such as that. With a total disregard for and without any respect for the people who live in the inner suburban areas it continues to construct freeways. </para>
        <para>If we are to have any hope of anything being done about the recommendations contained in the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, which was compiled after the Committee had taken reams of evidence, the Australian Government will have to take responsibility and see to it that the money which is allocated to the States and to local government authorities is spent in a proper way. The Government has to ensure that the interests of the people who live in- the suburban areas in our cities are protected by seeing to it that roads are constructed in a proper way, using the types of materials which ensure the safety provisions required. We have to have regard to these things. Surely we should have a view in relation to these matters. We should not allow their control to be wholly vested in people at the local government and State government level who have failed to protect the interests of the community. I think we would be failing in our responsibility if we allowed that to happen. As the Minister said, this is Just not on. </para>
        <para>We Should not allocate money in such a way that it is wasted. We have seen the results of the sorts of things that I have pointed out, and I refer again to the points I made about the underground railway project and the fact that the Victorian Government has failed to implement a proper plan of road safety. The elected Government in Victoria has for years and years had a road safety committee to investigate these matters. All that the Victorian Government has done is talk about the problem. After 2 children were killed on the Preston overpass over a reservoir we saw the spectacle of the Premier the next day taking kiddies across the road by hand. What cynicism! What an act of hypocrisy! The Victorian Government is just not doing the job. </para>
        <para>I repeat that it is the responsibility of this Government to ensure that proper roads are built and that we do not continue with freeway construction which is totally obnoxious to the people who reside in the inner suburban areas of Melbourne. The construction of freeways shows a total disregard for the wishes of these people. We must have a view about these projects. If we believe that they should not be built, we should be saying that they should not be built, and we should be allocating funds for specific projects. </para>

            <para>- Yes, all of us. I do not know what sort of contribution the honourable member for Parramatta would make, but he should have a say. The other point to make when we are talking about road construction is that one does not have to travel many miles out of Melbourne to see that local government has failed totally to do the sorts of things which are absolutely necessary. Quite frankly, when one looks at some of the performances of local government, it is sheer hyprocisy to say that it has the capacity to do the job properly. We think that local governments, State governments and the Australian Government should combine to plan for future road construction. If there is to be planning in a general way, why should it not foe in concert, with each of the 3 tiers of government participating? I believe that it would be totally irresponsible to allocate the amount of money provided in the Bill without providing adequate safeguards as to its expenditure. I repeat that the Road Safety Committee has done a tremendous amount of work which should not be wasted. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I have one other point. In Victoria a policeman who goes to the scene of an accident records certain details. There are not 2 States which have similar documents. It is impossible to computerise the detail which it is necessary to examine in order to look intelligently at the questions concerning road safety because each State has a different format for taking details at the scene of an accident. The States have been trying to solve the problem for years. I do not think that the track performance is quite good enough. I believe that we ought to participate. It would be irresponsible to allocate amounts such as those contained in the Bill without the Australian Govern ment participating in determining how the money will be spent. </para>

          <para>- I do not propose to speak on all these amendments. I assure the honourable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> that I have had a- very full breakfast and a reasonable night&#39;s sleep and that 1 am not in a bad state of mind; nor was I last night when I made a very strong and impassioned speech to the Committee in support of what the Government is doing. I stated clearly my position and the Governments position on the amendments. I have received a number of telegrams - 13 all told. I congratulate the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett)</inline> on the excellent work which he has done in organising six of them. I am giving him credit for it. I do not know whether I am doing him justice. I have received 10 telegrams, all - I underline &#39;all&#39; - from country shires. There is none from a city council. Not one city council has expressed one word of opposition to or protest against our plan. Not one of the 10 shire councils, six of which are either in or adjacent to and linked to the electorate of Maranoa, has expressed condemnation or criticism of the Government&#39;s action in requiring that the States and local government do certain things. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">All are expressing disapproval and disappointment that their allocations could possibly be reduced. Let us get the picture very clear. I have received 10 telegrams expressing no objection to this alleged centralised control, but I believe recognising that this Government is endeavouring to do something positive and constructive about transport in the interests of Australians. I have received 3 telegrams which are objecting to centralised control. They come from Victoria. It is interesting that the final sentence of one of the telegrams reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Shire supports retention of existing supervisory procedures of Victorian Country Roads Board. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That shire council does not mind centralised government supervision of the work it is doing. Yesterday I agreed to meet a former  president  of the Australian Shires Association who comes from Queensland. I will not name the gentleman as I do not have his approval to do so. One of the members of the Country Party, at very short notice, asked me whether I would meet this gentleman. I told him I would and we fixed a time. The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> and I set aside some time and met and talked with him. We explained what the Government&#39;s objectives were and what we were proposing to do. We said that more money should be available from the States to supplement the incomes of local government because this Government was not proposing under this legislation to require the States to make contributions to certain roads, namely, a national highway system. When we explain the situation to people similar to that gentleman there is a completely and totally different understanding. </para>
        <para>I had the benefit of 12 years experience in local government before I entered this Parliament. I served for a period as Lord Mayor of the city of Newcastle and I know a little about the workings of the operations of local government. Each year local government bodies prepare a works list. I notice that the honourable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Luchetti)</inline> is in the chamber. He is a former Senior Vice  President  of the New South Wales Local Government Association and I am certain that he will agree that it is customary each year for a council to prepare a works program. This has to be done. Otherwise councils would not be able to prepare their budgets. If councils do not prepare a works program they cannot determine what their estimates will be or what sort of rates they will have to levy. That is the position of local government organisations. What is wrong with their making those works programs available to us? We are a government which is keenly interested in making money available for the development of roads by local government and State governments and for the roads between our States which the national government has a responsibility to keep at a required standard for trade and commerce. Likewise we are interested in making money available for the development of roads so that at least we can get rid of some of the terrific bottlenecks that exist around our ports, both sea and air. </para>
        <para>Honourable members know of the time that can be wasted in travelling from Sydney to its airport or from Brisbane to its airport. If honourable members intend travelling at around peak traffic time and intend catching the 5 o&#39;clock plane out of Sydney or Brisbane the transport officers say that they had better be ready at least an hour before the plane is due to leave. If honourable members travel in the off-peak period it will take them from 15 to 20 minutes for the same journey. We want to provide more access. We want to be the people who decide. It is our responsibility to ensure that our air and sea ports can operate efficiently. Monstrous bottlenecks exist around Sydney. At present shipping companies are talking about imposing an 18 per cent surcharge on Australian freights that go through Sydney. One of the major contributing factors to these increased costs is the terrible road system around Sydney airport. This Government is aware of these facts. The Prime Minister wrote to the then Acting Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Cutler, seeking his approval for a joint study into a road system which will link with the new Botany Bay terminal. </para>
        <para>Shipping freight costs in and out of Australia are the responsibility of this Government. If we have an inefficient road system, obviously the people concerned with the transportation of our commodities must be required and must be entitled to increase freight charges, particularly if we are responsible for contributing factors. These are facts that require the consideration of this Parliament. This is the basis of what we are doing as far as transport is concerned in Australia. Therefore I ask honourable members to note the telegrams of congratulations to the honourable member for Maranoa on his organisation of the protests but unfortunately they all came in at the one time. </para>
        <para>The amendments proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland seek, in the main, to remove the powers proposed toy the Australian Government to approve programs of road works. The amendments also seek to remove any reference to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for Northern Development, to frustrate our provisions for representation on State bodies concerned with policy and planning of roads, and to remove the delegation of some ministerial powers to members of the Australian Public Service. </para>

If the shadow Minister wishes to raise points of order that I must confine my remarks - I realise I was stretching my entitlement as to what I was to speak about - then I am afraid I accept his point of order. </para>

            <para>- It is not my wish to stifle debate in any sense. Clearly the Minister is attempting to lay down in one long speech his objection in total form to the amendments we will be moving to individual clauses. This is quite improper in the Committee stage. I am unable to make the specific points put to me by the State Governments and to bring them before the Committee as each clause is dealt with. Therefore I cannot agree to the Minister&#39;s request. </para>

            <para>- I accept the situation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> It puts me in the position now of having to be up and down all day like a yo-yo, something I was trying to avoid to enable other honourable members to participate in the debate. The proposals outlined in the Bill provide for the Government to be in a position to approve a program. The principal objective is that we are trying to deal with an overall transport policy whereby we are allocating money for sea transport, air transport, rail transport and road transport. The principle in these 2 clauses has already been accepted. It was accepted on Tuesday night of this week by the honourable member for Gippsland in the debate on the urban public transport legislation. We do have consultation and discussions with the State authorities at both a ministerial level where necessary and a departmental level. We are represented on State boards. They have all agreed to a planning board, which enables this Government to feed in the information, ideas and objectives that it has. They are prepared to accept those things. This is basically what these clauses provide. Therefore we cannot see any consistency on the part of the Opposition. </para>

        <para>We have been accused of withholding finance from the States. I will demonstrate how malicious we are. I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that by arrangement with the States and in anticipation of getting these 3 Bills through the Parliament, the Treasurer paid $2.5m to the South Australian Government on 24 July and $1.7m to the Queensland Government on 18 July. Therefore I suggest to the honourable member for Maranoa, to whom I am giving credit for organising these telegrams, that he should take note of this information and convey it to those shire councils to which he referred and the other shire councils which have expressed their disapproval in respect of road grants and which have suggested that there is a possibility they will have to lay off labour due to a lack of finance. The honourable member can inform those councils in Queensland that the State Government has already received money. I repeat that it received $1.7m on 18 July. An amount of $4,083,000 will be paid to Western Australia today. The sum of $500,000 will be paid to Tasmania today. It is interesting to note that I have protests from Victorian shire councils stating that they will have to lay off labour because they do not have money. Let me put the facts clearly. Neither New South Wales nor Victoria has yet applied to the Treasurer for any money. They know they can apply because they have been advised by the Treasurer that money will be available to them. </para>
        <para>For those reasons it must be obvious to honourable members that clauses 4 and 5 of this legislation are important. They are the crux of the legislation. If we are going to put money into the States, then we have to have some say in regard to where it is to be spent and how it is to be spent - unless we return to the old system and give the States $1,1 26m over the next 3 years and have no say whatsoever in respect of where it is to be spent. That may have been the policy of the Opposition but it is not the policy of this Government. For those reasons we reject the amendments. </para>

          <para>- When the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> was addressing the Chair just a few minutes ago he said that telegrams had been received from only 13 councils and that ten of the telegrams came from the one area. I think that they were the figures he used. Perhaps he said that six of the telegrams came from the one area. He stated that no telegrams had been received from any city councils. The first point I make is that the reason for that is that no local council, almost until today, has been aware of the significance of this legislation. Nowhere in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech are the people of Australia told what is contained in the clauses of the Bill. Local government has not been made aware of the fact that it will be totally beholden to this Government. This will apply not only in relation to the funds which local government receives from the Australian Government and expends. I agree entirely that the Minister should have the right to oversee the expenditure of Australian Government money through State and local government programs. We do not object to that. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We object most strongly to the Australian Government having the right to oversee and control programs financed with money raised by the local governments through rates paid by ratepayers and expended locally by the local government. A similar situation applies in relation to State taxes. There is no justification whatsoever for this Government to intrude so heavily into State government administration unless the States agree to the oversight of moneys raised by State taxes for State programs. Indeed, this principle strikes at a very important point. This Bill will prevent an elected State government which wants to go to the people with a policy of taxing motorists to raise money for roads from laying down its program. The whole of that program can be overruled by the Australian Government. </para>
        <para>I think the honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> who is a reasonably fair minded gentleman will agree with me when I again make the point that it is fair that the Australian Government oversee the expenditure of Australian Government money on roads in a local area. It is not fair nor is it right or proper that the Australian Government should control the expenditure of money raised by way of rates by local government or by way of taxes by State governments and thus control local government or State administration. I repeat that the reason why other local councils have not sent telegrams is that the Minister for Transport in his second reading speech deceived them on this point. There was not one point of explanation in the speech directed to this matter. It is quite unfair for the Minister to claim that we as an Opposition are trying to frustrate the activities of the Government. If the Minister wants this power let him call a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and secure agreement from the State Ministers. He has not tried that. Earlier he talked about the need for co-operation. Last night the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> talked in terms of co-operation and how the Government wished to co-operate with the States. There is no sense of co-operation in this matter. This is a complete dictatorship from Canberra. This is nothing more or less than centralist control from Canberra. </para>
        <para>In the last part of the Minister&#39;s address he said that the Australian Government wanted to clear up the bottlenecks. That is just as easily done by administrative arrangements and in co-operation with the States through the use of Australian Government money as it is by directing the expenditure of State funds. This is a completely unwarranted intrusion into local government, both in the cities and the suburbs and also in the countryside. The second point I make is that there is a marked change in the level of expenditure available for local government in this year&#39;s program as against last year&#39;s. The total amount made available for the States in this year&#39;s program is S239m. The total amount made available to the States in last year&#39;s program and in the last Commonwealth Aid Roads Act was S279m. It is a complete deception to say that the difference is made up by the $400m which goes to the national highways program. The Minister should raise extra funds and stick to the report of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads in regard to the recommended allocation of funds. The Government makes great play of having these bodies report to and advise the Government. Then it totally ignores the reports. </para>
        <para>In relation to the other point, it is completely improper and unfair for a Minister to delegate to a public servant the right to oversee the administrative control of State or local government programs. That strikes right at the heart of the Constitution. No Act of this Parliament should convey that power and privilege without first seeking the agreement either of the Australian people or of the elected State governments. The Australian Government is trying to subvert the Constitution and to seek power in another fashion. It is completely improper and quite wrong of the Minister to tackle this matter in such a fashion. Clause 4(1) is specific. It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A Minister may notify a State the date before which a program of projects in respect of a period to which this section applies, being projects of a specified kind, is to be submitted to him for approval, and may, in the notice, inform the State- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">These are the important words -  that the program should include all the projects of that kind that are to be carried out by the State and by municipal, shire and other local authorities in that period. </para>
        <para class="block">Sub-clauses (2), (3), (4) and (5) and, I think, (6) and (7) of clause 4 give the Australian Government power to control the use of its own funds. But it is within sub-clause (1) that the power is given to the Government to control the expenditure by a State government of funds raised by State taxation and expenditure by local government of funds it has raised through rates. It is to that point that we object. Whilst the local government authorities themselves are not aware of that provision, the State governments have sent me telegrams bearing heavily on that point. I have read those telegrams into the Hansard report. Anyone who turns to the Hansard report of my speech in the debate last night on the motion for the second reading of this Bill will see that the States have objected very strongly to the Australian Government taking over the control of not only the expenditure of its own funds but also the expenditure by the State governments of money they have derived from State taxes and by local government authorities of the money they have derived from local government rates. That is why I have made the point that this is the most centralised approach that has ever been taken in any piece of legislation ever to come before this Parliament. Never before in the history of the Parliament have we seen a piece of legislation that attempts to subvert the Constitution in such a fashion and attempts to give such control to the Australian Government. That is why the Opposition is opposed to this provision. I move: </para>

          <para>- An examination of this Bill will reveal that it is really a quite remarkable piece of legislation. Clause 4 of the Bill is the central point which establishes the whole direction in which the legislation runs. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Therefore, in speaking to clause 4, it is inevitable that one will need to describe in brief terms what the legislation purports to do. The Bill will have 3 main effects. Firstly, the Commonwealth, without detailed or expert know-how on the subject of road building requirements, will be able to pass judgment on and make decisions relating to all - I emphasise the word &#39;all&#39; - road building projects undertaken by State and local government authorities. This Bill will enable the supervision of the construction of every piece of road pavement constructed in Australia. Whether it is to be constructed 1,000 miles away or 1,000 metres away, the Commonwealth will be able to supervise it in its entirety. </para>
        <para>Secondly, the taxes and charges raised by elected State governments and local government authorities are to be spent in a way determined by Commonwealth Ministers or those Ministers&#39; delegates who, of course, by definition will be public servants. It will be a public servant in whom the authority to make the decision resides. The third purport of the Bill is to make a State responsible for anything which any road construction body may do but if any road constructing authority spends money on a project not approved by the Commonwealth Minister the State can in effect be fined by the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- And fined in a very serious way. But let us clarify this point in our minds. A State cannot be fined as an entity as though it is something separate. What happens is that the people who live in that State are fined. There are 3 levels of government in Australia. There is the Commonwealth Government, the State governments and local government authorities. Each individual Australian has, so to speak, 3 identities. He has his identity as he is regulated and as he participates and elects people to local government authorities and to State and Federal governments. To give supremacy to the Federal Government in this way is to take away from the individual part of his character. The individual must be able to say that he wants to have in local government man X, woman A, woman B or whoever it may be. If they do not perform he can then say: &#39;I will vote them out of office&#39;. The same applies to State governments and the Federal government. What is happening by reason of this legislation is that before any road can be built a plan has to be formulated by local government or by State government and then it has to be submitted to the czar. I ask honourable members to have a look at the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> Can they not imagine him as a bust on top of a piece of marble - Czar Jones of Newcastle, a magnificent profile. Czar Jones will be the person who decides- </para>

            <para>- I will refer to him by his office. The Minister, for Transport will under the terms of this Bill be elevated to the role of czar. He will be able to determine where every piece of road pavement made in Australia goes. It would not matter whether it was outside this place, outside the State governments&#39; offices in the capital cities or outside the municipal office of any local government body. He is the one who will decide whether it can go ahead. The extraordinary thing that results from this is that a political party in a State can have an election and it can say to the people: &#39;Elect us and we will do this&#39;, outlining road making plans. The people of the State can approve that promise by electing that Party into government. Having elected it into government the new Cabinet or the returned Cabinet can, in accordance with its electoral mandate, formulate plans to build those roads. The czar created by this legislation can then say: &#39;We refuse to allow you to do it&#39;. It will not even be the czar who says that; it wil be his nominated delegate. </para>

            <para>- The effect of this legislation is that no single municipality in Australia can take a decision to buy such a simple thing as a road grader without the approval of the delegate of the Minister in Canberra. Government members might look out over the waters of Lake Burley Griffin but this Bill will not enable them to walk on that water. The Opposition ought not try to give the Government members the impression that we credit them with that amount of wisdom. We do not want to see compartmentalised decisions taken by nominated public servants, with a chain of policy command going right down through State governments and local governments. The essential question that the people of Australia are going to ask on this issue is: &#39;Does a Second Division officer or a First Division officer of the Public Service in Canberra who may receive a high salary better represent us than do the councillors of the city of Box Hill, Camberwell, Burwood, Parramatta or Sturt?&#39; </para>

        <para>Will the people of these cities be better represented by a level 4 Second Division public servant in Canberra or will they be better represented by the people who they elect and whom they have the capacity to sack? </para>
        <para>In a situation where there is a flood which results in the wash out of 6 bridges or a road washaway the local government body concerned will not be able to repair those bridges or the roadway until the Minister or his delegate agrees to this work being done. Under the terms of the Bill local government or State government has no right or authority to meet any emergency that arises. The Minister stood up and said: &#39;We are determined to fix the road access to and from airports.&#39; But the people who determine where the funds will be spent are the State governments and the local governments. Despite this, the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> asks the Minister whether there is to be an airport in his electorate, and if there is, where, and what will be the access to it by road. </para>
        <para>The Minister is clothed with unusual wisdom according to the Act, but I can assure honourable members .that there is no Act of Parliament which will give him wisdom, and there is no Act of Parliament which will give a public servant understanding, compassion or humanity or make him answerable to the people of Australia through the ballot box. We had the extraordinary spectacle of the Prime Minister saying that democracy is being white-anted. But what is white-anting it? This sort of legislation! </para>

          <para>-  No piece of legislation can invest a Minister or a public servant with wisdom. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> can talk about white-anting democracy, but what are we here for? Last night we were told that we were to sit today. The Government could not make up its mind until 10.30 last night whether or not we would sit today. The Government was not able to say till a week ago whether a joint sitting would be held. The Government first said that it would be in the first 3 weeks. Talk about white-anting parliamentary procedures! There is no more real way of doing that than by giving more and more decisions to Ministers and more and more decisions to public servants. The Government wants to get this sitting over with. But why are we sitting today? Why are we sitting on the fourth day in this week? Why are we sitting early in the mornings? We are doing so because the Cabinet is frightened of Caucus. We are meeting at 10 a.m. on Tuesday and 12 noon on Wednesdays because the Government wants to cut down the amount of time that is available to members of Caucus to examine legislation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I cannot believe that members of the Labor Party conscientiously and honestly want public servants to make these decisions. If this happens it will not be long before tha people in their electorates and municipalities start to realise that their elected officials no longer have responsibility. If we are to change the system and concentrate power in Canberra let us do it by way of referendum. Let us put in a referendum, to the people, the simple question: &#39;Are you in favour of giving the Commonwealth Parliament the right to pass legislation which removes policy decisions from local government and State government bodies?&#39; But what has the Government done? It uses the knuckleduster - that is the sort of fight this is - because it has the power of the purse. This Government will strangle other governments and, in strangling those governments, put all the power here in Canberra. Well, I suppose that for a while people will accept that that is the way things are going because they do not see any great problems in it at the moment. But, as the process continues, local government bodies will cease to have a role to play in this country. </para>
        <para>We can no longer accept this proposal. We have decided to fight it. We will not be intimidated by the Minister for Transport. If the legislation is passed, it will be an attempt to convert the Minister into a man with the powers of Caesar. But we will fight this proposal all the way down the line. We will not be intimidated. You will remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> that last week we took the decision that we would forgo the proposed rise in our parliamentary salaries. The Prime Minister tried to intimidate us into abandoning our decision by saying: &#39;All in, all out, one in, one out&#39;. </para>

            <para>-  This week there is an attempt to intimidate us by the Minister for Transport saying: &#39;If you proceed with your amendments, no money at all will be provided&#39;. All right. If the situation comes to that, the people will have to judge whether the sort of government that they want is one that seeks to intimidate by threatening the withdrawal of money simply because it wants to make the decisions itself. Are the Australian people to be treated as though they have no sense, no understanding and no will to make their own decisions? That is what the Minister is pro posing to do by this legislation. If no money is to be provided, let this be understood: We support the provision of the money proposed to be allocated by this legislation. We support also the right of the State governments and local governments to be involved in decision taking. We do not support the arrogation of the right to take all decisions in these matters to one Minister - the Minister for Transport - or his delegate. Additionally, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> must be satisfied as to the purpose for which funds are allocated. They could have a row. We can imagine them disagreeing for months. No money would be provided because of their disagreement. </para>

        <para>Let the issues be clear. The issues are these: Is there to be a concentration of all decision making power in the Minister for Transport and his delegate, or is there to be a continuation of the involvement of State and local government bodies in that process? The matter is as simple as that. </para>

            <para>- Yes, a partnership, as mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta. Australia is crying out for leadership and for co-operation, not confrontation. But what it is being offered by the Minister for Transport in confrontation. If the game is to be played in this way, I regret it. But, if it must be played in this way, we will have to fight. If we really want to see the country benefitted, the way to achieve that result is to make the money available in a fully co-operative manner. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>The Minister for Transport can amend this legislation very easily by proposing that the determination of the totality of road making plans be separated out into the national highways - we started the research on that aspect when we were in government; so of course we support it now - and then the urban arterial roads and urban local roads and the rural arterial roads and rural local roads for which grants are to be available. There is no reason why the Government should not say to local government bodies with respect to certain roads: &#39;You look after these. We are the national Government. We have national interests. We want to co-operate with you in these national interests&#39;. But the proposal that we have before us is that the Minister for Transport will be responsible for determining, for example, whether the street outside my house can be built by the local government body. It is an absurd proposition; that has only to be stated to be understood. I make an appeal to the Minister, in the interests of achieving the passage of this Bill in a sensible form. The Minister should not say aggressively: &#39;You have to do it my way or it is &#34;All out&#34;.&#39; The Minister does not possess all wisdom and nor does his delegate possess all wisdom. Wisdom is spread. The quality of democracy is that power is spread between Commonwealth Government, State governments, local government bodies and their respective employees. </para>
        <para>The Government and the Opposition have a common objective; that is to provide the money for road improvement and to do the job for everybody. I ask the Minister: Please, change your attitude. He will receive total cooperation from the Opposition if he changes his attitude, and the Australian people will benefit from it. Then he will be known as a benefactor and not, as he is likely to be known, as the protector of a bureaucratic inter.ferer who has no understanding of what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the right honourable Leader of the Opposition will grow up, stop playing childish pranks, calling people names, poking out his tongue and throwing stones. I do not take any notice of it. So let us get on and deal with the facts of the Bill. These grants are made under section 96 of the Constitution. There is nothing original about that. Under section 96 the Australian Government requires the State government or local government authority to do certain things. When honourable members opposite were in government time and time again they made grants under section 96 and laid down the conditions under which that money was allocated. That is all the Government is doing in this case. It is laying down conditions under which it is prepared to make grants available to the States. There is nothing original about that. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Bill says that the Minister may notify the States, and then it goes on. I do not propose to waste time reading the Bill. The facts are that the Government may require tho States to do certain things. It may require them to make certain information available to the Minister. I have the power to delegate certain authority to officers in my Department. Why do not honourable members opposite learn what is happening in regard to roads today and just what the procedures are? The power to delegate authority which is contained in this Bill is no different from that under which authority ? conferred on any road authority, whether it be a Department of Main Roads, a Main Roads Board, a Country Roads Board or some other such thing. Power is delegated to all these bodies. It is the customary thing. I do not want to spend the rest of my time as Minister signing letters so that things can be done, a road can be constructed, a piece of equipment can be bought or something like that. </para>
        <para>Delegation of power is the standard procedure in a public service. We are dealing with responsible men to whom power has been delegated. This is being done every day of the week by State governments and local government authorities. What is so terrible about that? A lot of honourable members opposite have had experience in local government. How many of them have objected to that procedure? According to them it is good for a State government or for a local government but it is wrong for an Australian Government. Duplication was allowed, approved, authorised by the former Government. When the honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> was Minister for Shipping and Transport he gave authority to public servants to approve single voyage permits. So did his predecessor. In fact, if I remember rightly, this procedure carried over from the time the honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> was Minister for Shipping and Transport until my time as Minister. I had to cancel the authorisation that these former Ministers had given to public servants. Who are the regional directors in Victoria, New South Wales and the other States who had the authority? Did they abuse it? Silence is the stern reply. Honourable members opposite know full well that those men did not abuse it and that they will not abuse any authority entrusted to them under this proposal any more than will public servants who have been delegated power by a State government or a local government authority. I have confidence in those men. I know that my predecessor as Minister likewise had confidence in people, because the facts are that he delegated authority to other people. We are still delegating power to public servants to approve things. There is nothing original in the question of delegating power. </para>
        <para>Under this Bill S 1,1 15m is to be allocated to the States compared with an allocation of $803m for the last 3 years of the 1969-1974 Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement. I ask honourable members to work it out. </para>

            <para>- What did the former Government do about inflation? It did nothing. It made an allocation for 5 yeans and did not increase one year&#39;s allocation to cope with the inflation that existed then. Therefore do not talk to me about what the former Government did about inflation. It did nothing. It did not increase its allocations under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement. We have decided what the allocation of money will be; that is perfectly true. It is our responsibility to do that. It is our responsibility to advise the States in advance what the allocation will be for 3 years, not for 5 years, as the previous Government did. We have cut back to 3 years the period which an allocation is to cover at the request of the States. A review will be made of the position in 18 months time so we will then have a roll-over program year after year. The facts are that more money is being provided this year. We are requiring the States to do certain things but those things are in conformity with the overall policies and plans of this Government to upgroads roads and transport as a whole. </para>

        <para>I ask honourable members opposite to examine the roads of this country which are the results of their policies. They will see the mess the roads are in today. Look at the deplorable condition of the various highways, for instance, the Bruce Highway in Queensland. The Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> can outline what the condition of that road is  -  the Redex trial highway, the highway of which the Opposition is so proud, the highway in relation to which the Opposition wants the States to retain the authority to determine how much money should be spent. The present Government will put money into this highway and will make it a decent road. Hundreds of people lose their lives in this country every year because of the deplorable condition of roads. Our objective is to see that the condition of roads does not cause loss of life. If the members of the Opposition are opposed to the saving of lives by building better roads, let them vote against the amendment, but that will not do them any good. </para>

Nobody should tell me that the fights between the Department of Urban and Regional Development and the Department of Transport must be enshrined in legislation so that the States do not know where the buck finally settles. These sub-clauses raise the question of consultations with the Minister for Transport or his delegate, perhaps a second division officer. That officer would go across to the Department of Urban and Regional Development to seek concurrence and the officer would say: &#39;I have to raise this with the Minister&#39;. So we have one Minister in one department talking to a second division officer in the other department. How on earth is any State government or any local government body to get resolution of the questions they raise? There is no point in enshrining in legislation the fights between power hungry departments. A simple solution, and a clear instruction for the States and local government bodies, would be for them to be able to come straight to the responsible Minister. We respect the position of the Minister for Transport so far as this Bill is concerned. We do not want it diluted by involving a whole catalogue of other Ministers. </para>

        <para>I want to make one other point. There is simply no parallel between a Minister for Transport or his delegate granting a single voyage permit for a ship to sail up the coast and, as under this Bill, a Minister for Transport giving power to a delegate to override the authorities of other constitutional governments, either State or local. The case the Minister used is not analogous in any sense at all. So to talk as he did when he was on his feet previously is quite erroneous. For these reasons, I have moved the amendments. </para>

          <para>-  I want to reply on behalf of both the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> and myself. The honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> who was a Minister in the LiberalCountry Party Government, is apparently completely unaware of his own Government&#39;s legislation which has been in operation since 1949. What he is now arguing against is what his own Government had done since 1949. I refer to the beef roads agreement which had its genesis in the States Grants (Encouragement of Meat Production) Act of 1949 and which has extended through to the current beef roads program completed on 30 June. The Treasurer of the Commonwealth was, of course, involved, but it was specifically provided that the Minister for National Development, as he was then known, was responsible for the administrative arrangements. The 1968 legislation is specific. It refers to the Minister for National Development with respect to beef roads, not the Minister for Transport. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Previous legislation specifically mentions the Treasurer in respect of certain areas but with regard to roads the appropriate Minister is specified. What the honourable member for Gippsland has said completely ignores legislation which he supported and which previous Liberal-Country Party governments have fol- lowed since 1949. The honourable member seeks to dismember or abolish the specialised divisions set up in the Department of Urban and Regional Affairs and in my own Department. The Department of Northern Development is especially concerned with beef roads which are an entirely different proposition from highways. The same principle applies to various aspects of the Department of Urban and Regional Development. These are specialised programs. You do not simply build beef roads from point A to point B. In working out where to build beef roads you pay heed to the location of the cattle industry and to land classification. You also have regard to rates of current turn-off of cattle and estimates of potential turn-off. You must pay regard  to  what will result from development. </para>
        <para>In association with State governments and Australian government agencies actual road programs are determined. An overall plan is formulated. That overall plan becomes the responsibility of the Minister for Transport. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development and I work within that plan in our respective departments. Has the honourable member for Gippsland heard any objections from the State governments about the way this has worked with respect to beef road proposals? Of course not. </para>

            <para>-  The honourable member is talking about this clause. What he wants to do is omit reference to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for Northern Development. By so doing we would then get some half-baked plan worked out in bits and pieces. This has not been the situation in legislation supported by previous governments since 1949. Let us not have any nonsense about this matter. What the honourable member is trying to do, as the Minister for Transport has pointed out simply, is to wreck the smooth operations that have existed for many years, even under governments he supported, and affect the co-operation that has existed between the States and the Commonwealth in certain areas. The proposal has worked with beef roads; it will work with the involvement of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and the Minister for Transport. For that reason the amendment is opposed. The system has worked in the past and previous governments have endorsed it. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I go a step further. The honourable member for Gippsland said that the Australian Government can play a positive part in the determination of roads. This has always been the position with beef roads. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Department of National Development in the past have all worked with the States in formulating plans, but it has been the Australian Government which has, in fact, determined those plans. This situation has been accepted by Western Australia, irrespective of what political party has been in power there; by Queensland, irrespective of what political party has been in power there; and, of course, by the Northern Territory which is Australian government territory. This system has worked in the past and it will work in the future. </para>

            <para>-  Yes. I am not objecting, nor is the Opposition objecting, to the Department of Urban and Regional Development or the Department of Northern Development using their special expertise in relation to this Bill; that is not the point at all. The point I am making is that there is no need to enshrine them in the legislation. Let that be a matter for co-operation between the various departments outside of the legislation. It is quite a different point entirely to involve the Treasury which deals with financial questions </para>

          <para>- I believe that we will be seeking to postpone clause 6 because it is a very complex clause. It contains a number of sub-clauses of considerable importance. If one deals specifically with the individual sub-clauses, one finds in sub-clause (3) reference to an approved program of projects for a certain year having to be submitted and to the fact that the grants for construction and maintenance of rural local roads should be made in accordance with the approved program of projects for that year. The Commonwealth Bureau of Roads, in its own report, specifically recommended against such a clause when it said that grants for rural local roads should not be subject to an approved program of projects. As considerable amendment is required in relation to each of the sub-clauses of clause 6, we will be seeking to postpone consideration of this clause so that further amendments can be brought forward. </para>

        <para>In this debate there has been considerable misrepresentation of the Government&#39;s position. During the debate honourable members have spoken about the need for participation by, and the need for the involvement of, State governments and local governments, yet when we get down to the real issues we find that they were summed up by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> Earlier in the debate he said: &#39;We want to be the people who will decide in relation to all expenditure, all proposals and all road developments&#39;. I am sorry that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> has left the chamber because one can understand what I have just said from the very nature of the remarks that he made to me a little earlier and of the remarks that he has made in other places, quite publicly when he has referred to the North Western Distributor. What he says, knowing of course that 1 agree that the proposition that this particular road proposal is most undesirable, is: &#39;How else will we be able to stop this proposal unless I and, presumably, the Minister for Transport have this power?&#39; That is the proposition that he puts. I reject that sort of proposition not because I do not want to stop that expressway proposal but because I believe that the people who have the responsibility of making that decision are the New South Wales Government, the government elected by the people of New South Wales. For that reason I do not want to see a transfer of power simply to achieve even what I believe to  bea  desirable objective. </para>
        <para>There is a great deal of confusion on the other side of the House. The honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> said that the Government was putting forward this proposition in order to stop freeway proposals. Yet in the second reading speech the Minister for Transport refers to a special report. He said in that speech:   . . in response to a request by my colleague the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren),</inline> identified many advantages of freeways over heavily loaded arterial roads. These advantages include very significant reductions in road accidents, decreases </para>

            <para>- I appreciate that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> 1 want to take this a little further, not along the lines that I was pursuing when you called me to order but in relation to comments made today by the Minister in relation to this question of power. Power is what is referred to in the clause to which I propose to move the amendment which has been foreshadowed. We are talking about the transfer ofthat power from the State Government which has the responsibility at the moment, to the Federal Government. The only justification that the Minister gave for this action- it is the only justification I have heard - was related to the difficulty that we as honourable mem bers have in reaching the Sydney International Airport. </para>

        <para>I would like to draw his attention, as I have done quite often throughout this debate, to the Sydney Area Transportation Study.I know that the Minister complained that he did not receive the Study as early as he might have, but I am sure that he has now had an opportunity to consider it in some detail. The corridor analysis indicates that 6 major transport corridors in Sydney require examination. They are the western, south-western, north-western, Manly-Warringah, the southern and northern suburbs corridors. The road to the Sydney International Airport falls within only a small ambit of the southern corridor. Yet the whole change of emphasis in our roads program to deal with the problems in the Botany area presupposes that we ought to neglect these other corridors, these other areas, where road programs are required. I am not saying that there are not proposals that ought to be advanced for the Botany area, but that proposals cannot be looked at to the total exclusion of the whole of the City of Sydney. We may well be influenced by our own concerns as to whether it is easy to get in and out of an airport, taking into consideration whether freight for which we might be responsible is affected by road proposals. But why should we assume a total responsibility for regulating State expenditure simply to achieve responsibility in those areas in relation to which we have to act at least to fulfil our responsibility. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>If the Treasurer so directs, as soon as practicable after such date as the Treasurer specifies, a statement in writing setting out such other information in relation to amounts expended or set aside for expenditure by the State on road works or in relation to expenditure by a municipal, shire or other local authority on road works, as the Treasurer specifies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This clause seeks to give the Treasurer the power to write to any local government body in Australia and demand from it, at any time he chooses, detailed information regarding roadwork expenditure in that local government authority area. The whole clause means that if there is some internal upset in a shire, such as flood, fire or famine, and there is some unexpected expenditure, the information is sent to the Federal Treasurer. If at the end of the year the expenditure does not total the allocation, because of the unexpected flood, the shire will probably not get any of the next year&#39;s road funds. I have never seen a better example of attempted bureaucratic control than to ask local government bodies to be responsible to the Federal Treasurer. It is complete nonsense. I have never known such a proposal. It seeks to interfere in the expenditure of every dollar raised by local government rates, paid for by local ratepapers. The Federal Treasurer wants to have a say in the matter. He wants to know the full program, including the expenditure program, of such a body. There is no need for the provision. </para>
        <para>As in all the other cases, there is not one word of explanation in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> why such a provision is necessary. The second reading speech does not give any information on any of these points in relation to which we have moved amendments. The second reading speech on this Bill could have clarified many matters. People outside the Parliament could be of the view that the Bill is a quite harmless one, in comparison with what they have been used to, when in point of fact it is completely different from the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act. The second reading speech does not inform the people of Australia on that point. This is another example of not one local government authority being notified of this provision. They must give an explanation to the Federal Treasurer on every dollar they spend on road making or on bridge making. If they paint a white strip down the middle of a road, they must tell the Treasurer. If they erect a road safety sign, they must tell the Federal Treasurer and tell him how much it cost. I have never known such pettyfogging bureaucracy. The Minister has given no reason for it and no justification for it. Therefore, we oppose the clause. </para>

        <para class="block">This clause is very much the centre of the whole problem with this legislation in that it gives the Federal Minister the right to delegate to any officer in his department the authority to override decisions taken by elected State governments or elected local government bodies. I register the Opposition&#39;s objection to that and will seek to move against it. The difficulty with the previous amendment was that on all matters that related to Australian Government representation on State bodies the Australian Government could dictate to the States what bodies ought to be formed in respect of the planning and administration of their road systems. Also the Australian Government could force representation on anybody if it so desired. We object to both those provisions. Because of the exigencies of time I do not press the debate any further at this time but I want the local government bodies to know full well what the Australian Government has planned for them in this legislation. </para>

Today the Minister for the Northern Territory and Minister for Northern Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> and I made an announcement following representations made to us by the Queensland Commissioner of Main Roads that we do something about the Burke Highway. We have issued a statement today to the effect that we are prepared to accept full responsibility for the Burke Highway.

At the time I happened to be in the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon,</inline> the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. I know my hearing is not quite as acute as it may have been in days gone by, but I heard no bells whatsoever. But when I returned to my own office on this side of the building I was informed that I had missed 2 divisions. I would be glad if an inquiry could be made to see whether on occasions like this when the Senate is not sitting the bells could still be rung in the various offices of the Parliament on the other side of the building as well as on this side. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">The first objection that the Opposition has to the National Roads Bill relates to clause 4 (3). The Opposition holds the view that clause  ought to contain the words &#39;the Minister may enter into an agreement with a State to declare a road&#39;. The clause at present provides quite an open cheque. Under this provision the Minister, without any reference to the State, can declare any road he likes to be a national highway. He can frustrate the planning of any of the States or local government authorities in this way. Because the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> claims that he likes to work in co-operation with the States, there should be no difficulty whatsoever in his being able to enter into an agreement with a State to declare a road to be a national highway. I think that it is a very important point to remember in regard to State and local governments. This move represents a complete contradiction of the Constitution in which the power lies. It is subverting the Constitution and it is quite wrong in principle. For that reason, the Opposition opposes the clause. </para>
        <para>The second amendment is to clause 4 (4). In this case, the Minister may declare a road in a State that would, if constructed, facilitate trade and commerce or the development of trade and commerce amongst the States to be a major commercial road. We agree that the Commonwealth should be able so to construct a road or take over a road for that purpose. We are fully in agreement with that principle. What we object to is the arbitrary way in which the Commonwealth can do this without any guarantees whatsoever to the States that anything will be done along the lines that the States or local government bodies themselves request. There again, we have moved an amendment to provide that the Minister may enter into an agreement with a State. Surely that is not asking too much. </para>
        <para>The next clause to which we take objection is clause 6 (6). I have moved the amendment which has been circulated to this clause to omit paragraph (b) and the words &#39;or an officer authorised by that Minister&#39;. Paragraph (b) and the remainder of the clause state:  in  a  place declared by the Minister of State for Urban and Regional Development, with the concurrence of the Minister, to be a growth centre for the purposes of this Act, unless the Minister of State for Urban and Regional Development or an officer authorized by that Minister has concurred in the inclusion of the project in the program. </para>
        <para class="block">We believe that the words &#39;or an officer authorised by that Minister&#39;, should be struck out of the last part and also that paragraph (b) should also be struck out. I do not believe that the Minister for Urban and Regional Develop- ment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> has any right to delegate an officer who will then have the right to override elected State governments and elected local government bodies. We are totally opposed to that concept. We heard the Minister for Transport who is at the table use the analogy of giving a ship a single voyage permit. Such action is not in contradiction of any Commonwealth, State or local government laws. That is not a fair analogy. In this case a delegated officer can overrule the wishes of an elected State government or a democratically elected local government body. For those reasons, I have moved the amendment to that clause. </para>
        <para>The final amendment deals with clause 15. I seek to omit clause 15 (1), (2), (3) and (4). Once again, this clause gives the Minister a power to delegate authority to any officer of his Department. I repeat that such an officer can override the wishes of a fully and democratically elected State government or local government body. This is quite improper. The Minister himself should answer any specific correspondence from State governments or local government bodies. It is quite wrong in principle for a delegated officer to be able to override ministers of a State parliament or local government officers. For those reasons, 1 have moved the amendments, copies of which have been circulated, to those clauses. </para>

          <para>- This Bill involves the old argument of whether the Australian Government should accept responsibility firstly, for a national highway system. There is only one thing wrong with what has been said. The honourable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> wants us to reach agreement with the States. Let me say firstly that there will be continuing discussion with the States on the locations of national highways- </para>

            <para>- I ask the honourable member to let me finish. If I may say so, we are dealing with national highways. We will be holding discussions with the States. Already I have given the honourable member 2 examples. The first one involves the suggestion we are making for a new highway which will come through from Collector close to Canberra and go on to Tumut. This is an Australian government project. We will be paying the full cost of it. We will co-operate with the State and we are seeking its joint consultation. The other project which I outlined earlier is the access road to Botany Bay. There will be joint consultation. We are prepared to go on doing this. So it is a question of whether we should have the right to make the final decision. If the States want to do so, they can object. If I am required to reach an agreement with the States and if they object so that we cannot get agreement, we can run into all sorts of loopholes. There can be gaps in highway development. We want to get away from that. We are prepared to accept our responsibility by deciding where the roads shall go. We are prepared to talk to the States about the matter. We are not prepared to be tied down. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Once again we come back to the old question of delegation of powers. We are doing what has been done in every Act as far as roads are concerned in every State. In all States the Minister does not retain total power. He has the right at any point to intervene and to make decisions but, in the main, he delegates power. As I said a moment ago, I have here a Press release which the Minister for Northern Development and myself released today. It is about representations made to this Government by the Queensland Commissioner for Main Roads. That is delegated power. The Queensland Minister did not write to us. His Commissioner for Main Roads did. The same situation applies to all other States. There is nothing sinister, objectionable or obnoxious about this as far as I am concerned. When a Minister wants to intervene he is at liberty to do so. I ask honourable members to imagine for a moment what would happen if a member of my Department tried to ride roughshod over some State Minister. Do honourable members not think that that Minister would immediately make representations to me or whoever may be the Minister for Transport claiming that his State was getting a rough deal? So at any time any delegated power is abused it is always subject to cancellation at a moment&#39;s notice if a Minister intervenes. Again I give an example of delegated power. What are the delegated powers and responsibilities of the Director-General of Civil Aviation? My God, he really has powers delegated to him which allow him to walk on Lake Burley Griffin. </para>

              <para>- All I wish to say is that planning and research certainly are needed. For example. I think that some of the announced policies perhaps not of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> but of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> have been misplaced. I hope that they will be revised on the basis of the more mature consideration which this organisation can perhaps give to it. </para>

          <para>I come back in particular to the things that have been said about the city of Sydney and freeway systems. I agree with the principles that, firstly, we should have more public transport and more people should use public transport, and secondly, that freeways should not necessarily be radial to the cities. But when one looks at Sydney one must realise that there is no possibility of getting a freeway on the eastern side because that is all sea. Indeed, the nearest freeway to the east must pass over the Sydney Harbour Bridge and thus go through the city. For that reason there needs to be a different kind of approach to the traffic problems in Sydney and one that is very different from that which the Minister for Urban and Regional Development has put forward in this House. It does seem to me that although he has been moved with excellent intentions the conclusions he has come to are not always sensible. I hope that the organisation which will be set up under this Bill will be able to correct a few of those misapprehensions for him. </para>
          <para>There is only one other point that I wish to make. I hope that this organisation will not be made a vehicle of more and more centralisation in Canberra. It is all very well to say - I agree with the Minister to this extent - that there should be an overall plan in regard not only to roads but also to the coordination of the various forms of transport. I believe that that is right and proper. But I disagree with the approach of the Government in 2 respects. Firstly, it wants to control not general principles but details. As I think the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> pointed out this morning, one cannot always be sure about emergencies which might crop up - the unexpected. There has to be more flexibility. The other point is that Canberra should not always be issuing instructions to the States on matters of detail. We are setting up under the series of Bills which we have been considering this afternoon machinery which will enable an evil-intentioned Minister to control and dominate the States in all their transport details. I am not saying that the present Minister for Transport is evil-intentioned; it would be quite unparliamentary for me to do so and, of course, I have no intention of being tempted to transgress the protocols of the Parliament. I go along with the Government in that I believe that there should be some overall Australian plan not only in regard, as I said earlier, to each particular form of transport but also in regard to the co-ordination of all of them. I do not go along with the Government when it creates a machinery which will enable it to control every detail, issue orders and become a kind of dominating authority. As I have said, the road to Canberra is paved with what the Minister likes to describe as good intentions. </para>

            <para>- Last night I rose rather reluctantly to move the adjournment of the Address-in-Reply debate. I say &#39;rather reluctantly&#39; because I have been waiting for something like 2 weeks to speak and finally I was given the nod. It may be that this is not a long time by some standards but I was placed on a list of speakers and then 2 minutes before I was due to speak notice came to me that I was not to speak last night. I wonder whether this happens to honourable members on the Government side of the House. I do not want to hear the excuse that the Opposition is delaying the proceedings of this House because I do not think that is a valid excuse. But I want to register a strong protest at the blatant disregard shown for the agenda. One might ask whether the person who draws up the agenda or changes it could produce an agenda for a simple monthly meeting of a sporting club or a parents and citizens association. This is the Government of Australia. I think that this action is indicative of the utter confusion and turmoil that the Government is in. I think that the people of this country should know of it. In my opinion there is nothing more uncertain than the uncertainty of this Government. I believe that the confusion and the uncertainty is breeding growing concern in the people of Australia. No wonder the country is in economic shambles. One might ask where is the plan of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> to combat inflation? We have heard of 5 point plans and 6 point plans. The Treasurer probably has a plan - it is probably a 10 point plan and as a result it will take a iittle longer to produce. We will probably hear about the plan when he finishes it. But why this rush to get Bills through? I wonder whether Ministers are afraid that there will be no funds to implement some of their projects and want to get in early. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I accepted your mild rebuke, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> a week ago when I was interjecting. I have since come to know you to be a kindly gentleman and to know that you exercise much tolerance. But I really was concerned for you yesterday, particularly during that part of question time when the House was in uproar when I felt sure that your blood pressure was rising. I was concerned also for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> last night and this morning. I am fully aware that in making this, my maiden speech, in this House I have foregone any privilege that is normally accorded a new member at such a time. I accept this situation and fully realise that I have no immunity with regard to interjections. </para>
          <para>There is a popular misconception among many people in this country that members of the Liberal Party, and Liberal parliamentarians in particular, are in the main rich people, or &#39;silvertails&#39; as they are sometimes referred to, who have attended private schools and tend to stand aloof from the great masses. This is a fallacy. It is a view that members of the Labor Party too often see fit to promulgate in an endeavour to denigrate the Liberals and win support for themselves. I want to advise this House that I am an ordinary person, that I am not born of wealthy parents and that I attended a State school, and that I recognise that I breathe the same air and eat the same food as other humans, that I came into this world and will go out of it the same way as all other humans. No doubt there are people on both sides of this House who are wealthy, who went to private schools and who still are ordinary down to earth people. </para>
          <para>One of the most pressing needs in Australia today is for people to realise that they must give a fair day&#39;s work for a fair day&#39;s pay. There is too great a tendency for people to take and to give little in return. There are demands by unions for higher wages and more leisure time that are not earned in terms of increased efficiency and greater productivity. Surely no one would deny anyone in this country the right to enjoy a good standard of living with adequate leisure time. But it has to be earned - not gained by easy handouts with no respect for a reasonable level of productivity. The people of this nation have to awaken because we are in danger of slipping into a most undesirable welfare state situation. </para>
          <para>The attitudes and approaches of governments have a big bearing on the attitudes and approaches of citizens of a country. In my opinion this Government has a huge responsibility to recognise and arrest undesirable trends present in our communities, trends that it has accelerated. Good, honest, hard working citizens are important to the solidarity of any nation, be it rich or potentially rich. Richness is surely not to be gauged only in terms of money in the bank or a person&#39;s assets, but more importantly by the honesty, integrity and plain decency of the person. So there must be a return to the contribution of a reasonable day&#39;s work, to people wanting to save for a rainy day, instead of the &#39;spend while the sun shines&#39; attitude. We must not have the creation of a huge welfare state. </para>
          <para>I recognise that it is important for every country to take care of its citizens who are among the less fortunate in the community. Having been associated with community and charitable work for many years, I am aware of the need for attention by governments in this area so that these people can live the respectable life that they deserve. So let us provide, and provide well, for these people but not fall into the trap of extending benefits to those who are able but not willing to make a contribution. I believe there is a tendency for this Government to overplay social benefit in some areas thereby creating deviates and dropouts instead of concentrating in the areas where there is real need. </para>
          <para>It is my firm belief that there must be greater understanding by the business world and the labour force that one cannot survive without the other. I believe that the pendulum is swinging too heavily in favour of the labour force and that incentive is rapidly being diminished for the businessman. It is here that this Government must take the initiative and ensure that the incentives within the business world are not eroded to an extent where the work force will suffer the consequences. There must be a common sense approach by the Government and the burying of the idea that businessmen are mostly out to exploit the labour force. It will only be when this sensible balance and understanding is reached between business and labour that productivity will improve and the nation begin to prosper further. </para>
          <para>I was concerned when, in this House on Tuesday of this week, I heard the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> mention that a business concern in Canberra had raised its rates. I was concerned also when the Minister for Labor and Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> rather flippantly made reference to increases. I am not here to protect the interest of big business. But I ask: Who will come to the assistance of the businessman when he goes broke? Will it be this Government, or will it be the unions? </para>
          <para>The unsatisfactory rate of productivity must be of grave concern to the Government. This rate reflects the attitude of many people who want to take so much and give so little in return. I listened with interest to the maiden speech of the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young).</inline> I wish that he was in the chamber now. The honourable member referred to the waste of money by political parties in the course of election campaigns. While I concede that he made quite a valid point one might ask him, other members of the trade union movement and the Government to examine the present industrial unrest. </para>
          <para>More work days were lost in Australia in the 4 months period from January to April of this year than in any full year since 1929. More than $18,170,000 were lost in wages through industrial disputes in April and in excess of $36,646,000 were lost in March. In April 1973 $3,134,000 were lost through this cause. In terms of productivity, this means a tremendous loss to our country and rather makes the expenditure on election campaigning pale into insignificance. If the Government is looking for a starting point to begin investigation into lack of productivity and the causes of soaring inflation the area of industrial unrest and the unreasonable attitudes of the unions would be a good place to begin. </para>
          <para>I wish to make one point abundantly clear. As far as individuals are concerned I do not differentiate between unionists and others. Some of my best friends are unionists. It is the unions and their unreasonable demands and those in government who succumb to all their demands to which I strongly object. Apart from a small amount of hard physical work a number of years ago, my working life has been largely devoted to the profession of pharmacy. I qualified as a pharmacist in 1958. To the best of my knowledge - and I know the profession fairly well - pharmaceutical chemists are not a wealthy race. They do not do what is popularly believed, that is, sell coloured water, although I will admit that the water tap is one of the most frequently used pieces of apparatus in the dispensary. Pharmacy is a very noble profession and very important to the well-being of our community. </para>
          <para>In the area of social welfare one section stands out as being in dire need of immediate assistance. The people on age, invalid and widows pensions in many cases are enduring a mere existence because of the high rates of inflation. I say this in spite of the proposed 55 a week increase in the single pension and 56 a week in the pension for a married couple. These are rises that should have been given 12 months ago in the light of the inflationary situation that Australia faces. I would remind honourable members that the pensioner pays just as much for his pound of butter, loaf of bread, can of jam, glass of beer, packet of cigarettes or whatever commodity might be named. In many cases pensioner couples are paying from $20 to $30 weekly for rental premises. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that, in the Brisbane area, variations of income from 1 July 1973 to 30 June 1974 of various employees - from clerks to plant operators and tradesmen to cleaners and to labourers - showed an increase of 34 per cent, while the income of the pensioner couple showed an increase of 21 per cent. This is just not good enough. If this Government will not take action to control inflation - it has not been successful to date; and one might ask whether it is really trying - something must be done to improve the lot of the pensioner. Wild promises were made about keeping the pension at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings. The truth of the matter is that the pensioner is falling further behind. The means test must be relaxed so that more pensioners can receive fringe benefits such as the pensioner medical service, telephone concessions, reduced radio and television licence charges, etc. There is fine talk by the Government in relation to the existence of poverty in this country. Inflation is increasing poverty daily, and the Government must act without delay in the needy areas. </para>
          <para>Currently I am serving as a member of a local authority - a position I have held for the past 7 years - and therefore I feel qualified to speak on this very important level of government that has been neglected for too long by Federal governments. As an alderman of a Queensland city with a population of approximately 40,000 and a percentage population growth rate ranking third among the cities in the State, I have experienced at first hand the problems that face a rapidly expanding urban community. I make this criticism of this Commonwealth Government in the full knowledge that previous governments which my own Party formed with the Australian Country Party also were negligent in not providing assistance to local government. I make no excuses for this criticism. From past performances one would think that members of this Parliament were completely oblivious to who is responsible for the provision of such important everyday services as water supply, sewerage, roads and drainage; the construction of playgrounds, sporting fields, parks and gardens; the provision of libraries and civic centres; and the disposal of garbage. All of the foregoing are extremely necessary for our everyday living. I was shocked to hear important aspects of town planning being debated so piously when the Glebe Lands (Appropriation) Bill came before this House, when local authorities are so vitally concerned with town planning, building by-laws and by-laws generally for the orderly and proper conduct of a community. </para>
          <para>Why then has local government not received more recognition from the Commonwealth Government? Presently local authorities are faced with rate rises, ranging in many cases from 20 per cent up to 50 per cent, in order to carry out their essential works. There is grave concern, shared by many in the over 900 local authorities throughout this country, that if a substantial share of the Commonwealth taxation pool is not channelled to local government stagnation will be widespread. Many serving members of local government, particularly in rapidly expanding urban areas, are loath to increase substantially rates and charges- virtually the only means of revenue - because it would be political suicide. From my experience in Queensland - I have no reason to doubt that the same applies elsewhere in the Commonwealth - local government is run with a good measure of efficiency. However, I believe that there must be more amalgamation of local authority areas, particularly in regard to shires where little or no development is taking place. Considerable savings can be effected, operations can be streamlined and better and more efficient use can be made of plant and machinery, with consequent savings to ratepayers. </para>
          <para>Too many councils and shires in Australia have provided no remuneration for their aldermen and councillors. Every&#34; man is worthy of his hire, and if we are to attract men and women of quality to participate in local government we must ensure that they are compensated adequately for their time and efforts. It is absurd and, indeed, unthinkable to have rapidly expanding cities or shires with budgets of, say, &#167;10m to S50m with a mayor and 8 aldermen as directors receiving a collective maximum of SI 5,000 to $20,000 annually, as is often the case, and with many of them putting in up to 30 or 40 hours a week individually. In my opinion, local government must retain its present autonomy. It is vital that these dedicated men and women in control of the local government scene - the area of government closest to the people - retain autonomy of their areas of responsibility. </para>
          <para>I remind members of this Parliament that they are the most remote from the people and are somewhat inaccessible; the State members of Parliament are a trifle more accessible; while the. members of the local council take the brunt of everyday complaints. When he raises rates, the residents raise Cain; whereas the State and Federal members can more readily duck the blame for increased taxes. To date the Government has given only lip service to assistance to local government needs. It is true that the Grants Commission, for the first time since its inception in 1933, has been hearing the case for assistance to local government. I know that everyone connected with local government is watching and waiting anxiously for the findings. I sincerely hope that no forward-thinking council, because it has provided costly services and amenities for its ratepayers, will be disadvantaged by the Government&#39;s policy of wanting to bring equality to all areas. </para>
          <para>I want to make 2 points abundantly clear: Firstly, I believe that there is a share of Commonwealth taxation that rightfully should go to local authorities on a &#39;no strings attached&#39; basis. This money, I stress, must be in the form of non-repayable grants. Secondly, it should be channelled through the State governments. I am firmly convinced that there are no bodies better equipped than the State governments to handle the distribution of funds. Their government departments and State members are in constant touch with all local authority areas and are best fitted to know the needs of a particular area. There is no need for constitutional change to allow grants to local authorities. Any government can show its bona fides by making the grants available, as did the McMahon Government in 1972 to relieve unemployment. This practice was contitnued for some months by the Labor Government. </para>
          <para>I would point out to the Government that whereas rating is based on the unimproved value of the land, the pensioner, the person near to the poverty line, the middle income earner and the wealthy, all living in the same street, are rated the same amounts. Local government does not have at its disposal the same methods of differential taxation according to income as the Commonwealth Government has. It is only through greater recognition of the plight of this area of government by the Commonwealth that relief will come. We must remember that every citizen of this country comes under the control of some local authority. </para>
          <para>My electorate of Petrie comprises a number of northern Brisbane suburbs, a good portion of the Pine Shire, a small portion of the Caboolture Shire and the whole of the city of Redcliffe. The area contains some 77,000 electors and the 4 local authorities in the electorate are. all experiencing rapid growth with resultant growing pains. All councils are desperately short of funds to provide what everyone in this House would term essential everyday services. Representatives of these councils are fully aware that many of their ratepayers are stretched to the limit and cannot meet further substantial rate rises without a great deal of hardship. For too long a blind eye has been turned to local government. We must face the problem full on with both eyes open and the purse strings undone. </para>
          <para>In my opinion the encouragement of home ownership is an important ingredient in building good citizens. I am appalled at the attitude this Government is adopting in relation to 2 matters that vitally affect home ownership. Firstly, high interest rates are pricing young would-be home owners into being flat and rental home dwellers for the rest of their lives. Secondly, the decree that Commonwealth funds spent through the State housing authorities are to be spent at the rate of no more than 30 per cent on homes for purchase and 70 per cent on homes for rental is indicative of the Government&#39;s attitude to home ownership. If we are to build good solid citizens in this country we must instil pride into them, and what better way than starting off with pride in home ownership? In Queensland over the past 30 years in excess of 45,000 homes have been constructed by the Queensland Housing Commission, resulting in 59 per cent being for ownership and 41 per cent for rental. This more desirable situation will be rapidly reversed, and with no incentive for home ownership large numbers of rental homes will tend to deteriorate along with the attitude of the occupants. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I can only stress that from my personal point of view I will do my utmost to make a useful contribution to the running of this Parliament and pledge my loyalty to Queen and country. I congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> on your election to your high office and I would mention the great assistance I have had from the staff in Parliament House and from my colleagues. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>may I first add my congratulations to those of so many others upon your election to your high office. I look forward to your friendship and impartiality. I succeed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Maisey as the representative of the electorate of Moore. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maisey</inline> served Moore for nearly 11 years as a parliamentarian, and in a sense he served the electorate for many years before that with a contribution to the wheat industry. I am sure that he has contributed much to the electorate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Moore electorate is diverse. It extends from Three Springs in the north to Merredin in the east to the commuter suburbs of the Wanneroo Shire and the Darling Ranges. I am proud to represent farmers, cray fishermen, blue and white collar workers, the young, the old, home owners, home renters and home buyers at present struggling to service mortgages on homes in the face of high interest rates brought about by current government policy. I would be hard pressed to find 2 people among the 64,000-odd constituents of Moore who have identical needs, abilities or ambitions. It is clearly ridiculous to imagine that one strong central government could cater for such diversity. It is clearly ridiculous to imagine that a government 2,500 miles away can make itself aware of the ambitions of groups of parents at Girrawheen or Beacon or the new priorities for roads at Leeming or Kalamunda, or to understand the difficulties of new land farmers or the traffic in Wanneroo Road. It is even more ridiculous to imagine that a central government can rank all diverse matters in some meaningful priority and act in the best interests as seen by the local population. Yet, if the whole purpose of government is not to serve these people, what is its purpose? </para>
          <para>The whole effect of remote control is to enforce needless conformity so that each and every one must accept his second best or third best or even poorest choice. If groups of people elect to go their own ways, to develop their own communities that happen to suit them, is that a bad thing? Is it a bad thing that Australians should have the widest possible choice as to their way of life and their life style? Only such conformity as is necessary to the functioning of the nation and of society ought to be imposed, not that conformity which is necessary to impose a political philosophy. Furthermore, if Government is to have the authority that comes from cooperation it is necessary that the people feel that they are part of the process of Government; it is necessary that they take an active part in the process of government, be it State or shire or even a parents committee. Furthermore again, if Government is to remain responsible not just to Parliament but to those governed, it is most important that people can easily and personally take issue with their elected representatives. There is no one easier to kick, as the honourable member for Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodges)</inline> has pointed out to the House, than your local shire councillor - poor chap. There is no one more responsive to popular wish, yet real power over the most vital issues is almost removed from his hands. </para>
          <para>I wish now to say a word about the meaning of decentralisation. It is, in truth, 2 issues - one of people and one of powers. They are often confused; I believe often deliberately confused. The Australian Labor Party talks of growth centres like AlburyWodonga. There is decentralisation of people. Time and circumstance may show just how sincere it is on that issue. When one ponders roads, telephones, superphosphate then, with the greatest charity, one wonders. However. my concern for the moment is with decentralisation of powers. The present Government makes no pretence of a commitment to decentralised authority. It is unashamedly and with commendable consistency committed to centralised power. The erosion of State and local government authority is, I concede, nothing new though the process has accelerated out of sight in the last 18 months. Because the tendency dates back to Federation and has continued at varying rates through governments of the Right and the Left, we must look for innate causes as well as those of political commitment. We will need to understand those causes in order either to halt or to reverse the trend. <inline font-weight="bold">Major taxing</inline> power is at the centre. The Commonwealth undoubtedly has the widest tax base and the shires undoubtedly the narrowest. The flow of funds is from the centre out. Given that tax policy is, or can be, a major tool in the management of the economy, this is good and maybe even necessary. When the money flows out, however, authority flows in. Funds with all sorts of instructions as to their use flow from Commonwealth to State to shire, and so authority flows from shire to State to Commonwealth. It is another case of he who is paying the piper is calling the tune. </para>
          <para class="block">The States are both victims and aggressors. The process in the past, I suspect, was initiated by the natural tendency for every person to accept his own judgment first. Ministers of the Crown, in effect, said: &#39;We cannot possibly let the States or shires spend all that money we have raised in such and such a manner when I judge otherwise&#39;. They felt responsible for the moneys, and yet there is no reason to believe that they are any less fallible than those nearer to the people. What once occurred by degrees and by default has now taken on the form of an organised attack. The strategy is simple. First beggar the States and shires, then offer them grants tied in the most minute detail that in the face of bankruptcy they cannot refuse; play State off against State, shire off against shire, and both off against their electors. Witness the Coogee by-election in which one State Premier was called in to defeat another, using the argument that the people of Coogee were suffering because the State of New South Wales had not accepted tied Commonwealth grants. Maybe the people of Coogee are worse off in the very short term - I do not concede that they are - but how much &#39;better off will the State of New South Wales be in the long term if the principle of State authority can be established? Local government is being emasculated so that instead of being the third arm of government it is becoming an administrative organ of the Commonwealth without meaningful powers of determination. And what of the States? As I understand both the policy and the trend, they are to disappear altogether. So much for the situation as it is. </para>
          <para>I turn now to what might be done about it. We can, on track record, dismiss any hopes that the Whitlam Government of its own initiative will do anything to decentralise powers. Perhaps on occasions those pieces of legislation that most blatantly usurp State and local authority will find passage through the Senate too stormy. However, the failure of those Bills will result at least in temporary financial difficulties for those same States and shires. The transfer of power too often does not depend on legislation in any case. In the face of current politics and government policy the one hope is that the States will make a stand together and use what political muscle they can muster to defy the usurpation of those powers that it was constitutionally intended they should exercise. Their united voice will surely carry some weight so long as this Government cherishes any hopes of re-election at some future date. </para>
          <para>The meeting of the 6 State Premiers in Melbourne - two of them Labor, one Country Party and 3 Liberal - is historic. It is the first time, I believe, that they have met in the absence of a Prime Minister. At least in some areas a joint approach was agreed upon. They displayed a willingness to speak with one voice to the Commonwealth on at least some matters. The Commonwealth Government - any Commonwealth Government - must find it more difficult to resist a united voice, particularly one that contains members of the same Party as the central government. The united approach &#39;becomes, in a sense, an appeal to the electorate at large - the final determinant in all matters political. The only satisfactory long term solution to the problem of State and local government powers is the provision of adequate finance over which the State or shire has complete determination and for which it is completely responsible. This is not to say that they must raise all their own taxes; rather it is to say, firstly, that general untied grants should be sufficient to enable the recipient to conduct its own affairs as it wishes and, secondly, that the grants should be finite and should engender responsibility. Irresponsible expenditure should never result in further grants. Matching money techniques are unsatisfactory because the smaller body need never weigh the total cost against the benefit. Fourthly, revenue will need to grow with population and inflation. A guaranteed proportion of income taxes flowing to the States as of right without strings would fulfil these needs. It would return real authority to the States. Then, with the States meeting the Commonwealth as equals, it might be possible to agree upon a sensible rationalisation of responsibilities with powers transferred in both directions. I commend the amendment. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>firstly I congratulate you on your re-election to the high office of  Speaker.  I also convey my congratulations to the other new members on their contributions to this House through their maiden speeches- It is a significant honour to have been elected by the people of Hume to be their representative in this Parliament. Hume is a large area covering approximately 13,000 square miles in the south-west of New South Wales. It runs from Blayney in the north to below Batlow in the south,  aDd  from the Australian Capital Territory border to Temora and Junee. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> will refrain from making it any larger than it is at present. Country people have a right to access to their member and they are already at a significant disadvantage when compared with electors in metropolitan electorates. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Hume is adjacent to the Australian Capital Territory and possesses some of the best country and some of the best towns in Australia. It is the home of that great Australian, Henry Lawson, who was born at Grenfell and is honoured in that district yearly. Grenfell was also the haunt of the great Ben Hall, and the fact that it is the home of two distinguished Country Party men, the honourable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr England)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Doug</inline> Scott, is not to suggest that they too are bushrangers. </para>
          <para>I extend an invitation to any honourable member who is stranded in Canberra for a weekend to come into Hume and experience the best of what Australia has to offer. I am sure all honourable members have enjoyed a Batlow apple or a glass of Mountain Maid Cider or a cherry from Young, but I wonder how many have driven through the hills and pine forests around Tumut and Batlow as the Prime Minister will do in a few months time, or have been up the magnificent Lachlan Valley from Young to Cowra. How many have fished in Burrinjuck or Wyangala Dam? How many know that the Edgell country garden is in Hume and that most of the steak you eat in the dining room is from the Conkey abattoir in Cootamundra - all the good steaks anyway. I can recommend Hume to any honourable member who is interested in good people, good food and good country and I want to assure Government supporters that there is no truth in the rumour that the dog which sits on the tuckerbox at Gundagai has been trained to bite members of the Labor Party. </para>
          <para>This Parliament has been honoured by the presence of some distinguished former members for Hume, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arthur</inline> Fuller will be remembered by many. He first came into this place in 1931 for the Labor Party. He won and lost his seat on several occasions and claimed that he made 3 maiden speeches. I hope that does not happen to me.  Colonel Charles  Anderson, V.C., M.C., is enjoying good health and is still living in Hume.  Colonel Anderson  has been a source of .inspiration to me and there would not have been a better Australian ever to serve in this House. Ian Pettitt is still living at Harden in the middle of Hume. He served this Parliament well, particularly on committees, and especially in the areas of social security and Papua New Guinea affairs. He has also been of great assistance to me. My opponent, Frank Olley, the former member, will, I understand, remain active in political circles and I congratulate him on his result. These men all served Hume well and have set me a high standard. I have given my electors an undertaking that I will be serving their interests on a fulltime basis; I will have no other distractions. I hope my representation of the electors of Hume is of a high standard. </para>
          <para>I wish to point out to the House the state of rural unemployment in Australia. The House may be aware that at the end of June 78,827 people were registered as unemployed. The House may not be aware that 43,255 of these were rural unemployed. Almost 55 per cent of the unemployment in Australia today is in the country, not in the cities. The people who live in Hume and in country areas generally want to know what proposals the Minister for Labor and Immigration - or his spokesman in the House, the Deputy Prime Minister - have for alleviating non-metropolitan unemployment. We used to have a system of making money available to local government to provide jobs in the country. I would like to see consideration given to reintroducing rural unemployment relief to equalise employment opportunities in non-metropolitan Australia. </para>
          <para>One of the most significant problems facing the electorate of Hume is the interaction between the electorate and the national capital, Canberra. I listened the other night to my neighbour, the honourable member for EdenMonaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whan),</inline> with some degree of envy. He spoke, the House may recall, of what a wonderful time Eden-Monaro had had under the Labor Government. He referred to it as a &#39;bonanza&#39; for Eden-Monaro. I can only think that Hume was behind the door when the goodies were &#39;being handed out. 1 want to take this opportunity of making a strong plea on behalf of Hume and its people for some consideration in this question of over the border growth and the responsibility of the Australian Government in this area. </para>
          <para>There can be no question that the Australian Government must accept a responsibility for the effect the existence of Canberra has on the surrounding area. The Barton Highway must become a Federal responsibility. The road to Tumut must become a reality. Negotiations must be actively pursued with the New South Wales Government to enable the people of Hume to be at no disadvantage because of their proximity to Canberra. Arrangements between the Commonwealth and State Governments must be concluded to allow for the proper planning of the region. If these arrangements are not concluded soon there will be irretrievable harm caused by the pressure of an expanding Canberra on those currently responsible for the administration of this area. Let this Government be aware that there is a western as well as an eastern side to the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
          <para>Another point I wish to draw to the attention of the Government is the extent to which poverty exists in rural areas. One has only to go as far as page 8 of the interim report of the Australian Government&#39;s Commission of </para>
          <para class="block">Enquiry into Poverty dated March 1974  -  the Henderson report. There we see that 399,000 family units are very poor, that is, below the poverty line. This represents an average across the nation level of 10.2 per cent of families. But what is the position in rural Australia, excluding farmers. Rural Australia accounts for 142,000 of those 399,000 below the poverty line families. So 14.4 per cent of rural families are below the poverty line compared with the national average of 10.2 per cent. Henderson does not say at what level that leaves the city average. </para>
          <para>A similar situation exists in the other category listed by Henderson - rather poor or less than 20 per cent above the poverty line. In this category the national average is 7.8 per cent and the rural - non-farmer - figure is 10.8 per cent. These figures are significant. I know what the reaction would be if the figures were reversed. If city poverty figures were higher than the national average, massive programs of redistribution of wealth would be instituted. But country people are not treated in like fashion. I call on the Government to act immediately to reduce the high level of poverty in rural Australia - non-metropolitan Australia. </para>
          <para>I would like to record some of my feelings towards the condition of youth in country areas. When I refer to youth I refer to the teenage group, particularly at the middle and younger end of the scale. So many of the towns in Hume have an empty shop which has been filled with pin-ball machines and is full of young people participating in that noble occupation known as hanging round. These kids are just waiting for the day when they will be old enough to go into a pub and switch from coke to beer. It seems to me a tragedy that the future of this country - the young people - are not encouraged to do something more worthwhile than play pin-ball. I would hope that the Australian Assistance Plan or some other agency of this welfare Government would look into this problem which by no means is confined to the country. Perhaps the Minister for Tourism and Recreation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart)</inline> could institute a survey of recreational needs and suggest possible ways of meeting the demand by youth for such facilities. </para>
          <para>I have referred to the attributes of Hume, one of Australia&#39;s premier rural areas, with its dozen or so medium size towns. It produces the best fine wool in the world, particularly in the area around Yass; it is one of Australia&#39;s richest wheat producing areas and is second to none in terms of beef and lamb production. It is diversified with fruit and vegetables and supports light industries, including pine processing at Tumut and magnesium processing at Young, as well as major railway centres. I mention these points because this is the record of achievement of the people of Hume. They are fine people who have worked hard and who continue to work hard tilling the soil and building their businesses. In doing so they have helped make Australia the rich and prosperous nation it is today. The people of Hume have been fortunate to have had naturally productive soil. But they have not sat back on their inheritance and taken things easy. These people have accepted the challenge of increasing their productivity and getting the most from their soil realising that not to go forward is to go backward. Over the years they have had the incentive to do better and to improve on what they started with. This is the great Australian spirit - the Australian tradition. </para>
          <para>In times of plenty they have re-invested in the soil and bought bigger and better machinery. They have ploughed their money back into Australia and enabled industries in the cities to grow and employ more people, producing and satisfying the needs of these country people. Australia has led the world in the field of agricultural machinery because of the demands and initiatives of country people. </para>
          <para>The people of Hume have contributed handsomely to Australia. They have accepted their responsibility as owners of fertile lands. They deserve the support of Government in adverse times, having established their bona fides as worthwhile Australians and honest workers. We have witnessed under this Labor Administration the most severe and the most unjustified attack that has ever been experienced by the rural sector. Country people, including the people of Hume, are Australians like all other Australians. They are hard working and conscientious, perhaps more so than other groups. They deserve a better deal than what has been served up since December 1972. Like all businesses they need incentive. They need a reason for staying in business. They need and are entitled to a fair return for their labour and a fair margin on their investment. Without this incentive they will not strive to produce and Australia will be the poorer. </para>
          <para>This Government had no right to bring an entire and an important section of the Aus tralian economy to a position where, today, it is on the brink of disaster. This Government should have known that seasonal and economic factors are such that rural industries can move from never so good to never so bad within a space of 12 months. This Government should have seen that the decline had already set in when it started the great rural rip off. The Whitlam Administration will rue the day that it upset the balance in Australia&#39;s rural industries. Do the memories not go back only a few years when the last recession nearly bankrupted the country towns, when those towns that depend on a viable rural industry - there are plenty in Hume - were racked with unemployment and closing business houses, when foreign exchange was not being earned? No government can allow an entire sector of the community and the economy go to the wall as a result of that government&#39;s actions. If present trends continue and rural industries begin to collapse this Government will be forced to mount a massive rescue operation that will cost more than what is being ripped off under the Coombs manifesto. Australia will continue to need a viable rural industry into the foreseeable future and it will need people like those in Hume to operate it and to work in the towns. I make this plea on the occasion of my maiden speech. Let us unite Australia as one powerful productive force, as one great and undivided people, as a country ready and able to assume its responsibilities in a difficult world. Finally, I would like to let the Government know that I am here to represent the people of Hume and I will attempt to do that to the best of my ability. </para>
          <para>I wish to thank the electors of Hume for expressing their confidence and trust in me and I pledge myself to honour that confidence and trust. I commend the amendment to the House. </para>

            <para>- In a few weeks the Government will be considering its Budget. I should like to make a plea for the inclusion in that consideration of one special group. Last week the representatives of the Supporting Fathers organisation waited upon the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> These people are representatives of widowers with dependent children and of deserted husbands with dependent children. I believe that this group is worthy of special support and urgent consideration. Unlike widows, deserted wives or divorced women these people receive no help from the Government whatsoever. I believe that they would have been next in line for relief if we had remained in power. However, I do not take this on a party line at all. I ask the Government to give special consideration to the needs of these people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is a terrible thing for a husband to lose his wife by death, particularly a young wife, because it is only comparatively young women who have dependent children. It is bad for a husband to be deserted and for his family to be left without a mother. When a husband receives this emotional shock why should we make it almost impossible for him to proceed to hold his family together? Why should he inflict on him. the added grief of the family being broken up because he cannot meet the financial commitment of keeping it together. A man has his job. If he does not have his job he has no income. If he has a small income he cannot afford a housekeeper. How can a deserted husband leave his children unprotected, unguarded and not looked after at all. For that man there may be no help available. He may be lucky and have a mother who can take in her grandchildren, or a sister who can take in her nephews and nieces. He may have some relative or friend who can look after them. That is second best, but it is better than having to relinquish them and allow them to go into some kind of institution. </para>
          <para>These men do need help. In these days of &#39;women&#39;s lib&#39;, or whatever we may like to call it, the widowers and deserted husbands should be placed on the same footing as the widows and deserted wives. It may be only an interim solution. The operation of the means test will prevent such men ever drawing pensions and getting into a rich category, but they do merit or deserve this special help. I make the plea to the Government that in this Budget some recognition be made of the special needs of these people - the supporting fathers, the widowers with dependent children and the deserted husbands with dependent children. They should be at the top of the priority list. I commend this cause to the Government. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you do not need to be reminded, because you are the man who always chairs the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House, that on a number of nights in the last couple of weeks a battle has been waged between the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> and me. Mine has been a battle to extract truth and to ascertain facts. Regrettably, on each and every occasion, the answer I have received has been simply a tirade of abuse. Last night I was supported toy the honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay),</inline> who is the shadow Minister for Services and Property. I hope that the Minister will recognise that we on this side of the House regard the matter that has been raised as serious and that he will not treat it as a flippant issue. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Last night the Minister presented to the House a sheet containing certain details of the use made of the secretarial pool toy various honourable members. What I want to point out now is that that sheet, which I agreed to have incorporated in Hansard, covered the period since the inception of the system which the Minister generously and kindly introduced initially. The period in which I am interested is the 3 weeks prior to the election. Would the Minister mind listening? Apparently he does not want to listen. I hope that question No. 853 on page 1003 of the notice paper is answered quickly because the answer to it will provide the details we seek. If I am proved wrong and favouritism has not been exercised towards members of the present Government Party I will be the first to stand up here and say that I am sorry. But if I am proved correct - I hope that the Minister does not let this question remain on the notice paper month after month - I hope that he will recognise that he must accept responsibility for what goes on within his Department. It is not satisfactory for him to stand up in this place and say: &#39;I do not interest myself in such matters&#39;. It is his duty to ensure that his Department administers fairness to both Government and Opposition members. </para>
          <para>I repeat a comment which I made much earlier - abuse will get nobody anywhere. If the Minister thinks that he can intimidate me by saying that I will not get secretarial assistance in the future or by casting nasty reflections upon my breeding - to use his words - and that that will silence me, he is wrong. I work to a very simple rule. If I believe something is wrong and I have done my work to check it out to ensure that I am not incorrectly implicating anybody, I will pursue the issue until the end no matter what might be hurled at me or said about me. </para>
          <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

            <para>The Public Service Board has informed me that detailed records are not kept on this aspect of recruitment advertising. The provision however was included, for example, in advertisements for staff for the Board&#39;s own Office which appeared in the press in December 1973.

          </talk.start>
          <para>The proceeds of taxes levied by the Australian Government on fuels are paid directly into the Consolidated Revenue Fund where they form part of the general revenue of the Government. This is in accordance with the policy of the Australian Labor Party as decided at the 1971 Conference, that fuel taxes should be regarded as general revenue taxes. In principle, taxes on petroleum products are similar to other general revenue taxes such as those levied on beer and cigarettes. The proceeds of these general revenue taxes are not earmarked to finance particular types of outlays but are used to assist in financing outlays over the whole range of the Government&#39;s activities. </para>

            <para>-  The answer to the right honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The maximum subsidy payable under the Aged Persons Homes Act was increased from $5,200 to$6,000 per single unit as from 1 April 1974 and an additional subsidy of up to$1,600 per unit introduced for land. The Government also gave approval for the maximum grant payable under the Aged Persons Hostels Act to be increased from $7,800 to $9,000 per person (or$1 1,400 where purchase of land is involved) also to take effect from 1 April 1974. The increase under the Aged Persons Hostels Act requires an amendment to the Act which the Government intended to enact during the Autumn Session of Parliament, but was prevented from doing so by the double dissolution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has announced its intention to increase the rate of subsidy payable under the Aged Persons Homes Act from $2 for $1 to $4 for $1. Based on the present upper cost limit for subsidy purposes, i.e., $9,000 (or $11,400 including land), this will increase the maximum subsidy for a single unit from $6,000 to $7,200 and the additional land subsidy from $1,600 to $1,920. The organisations referred to by the right honourable member have suggested that the abovementioned upper cost limits, which were increased from $7,800 to $9,000 (or $11,400 including land) as from 1 April 1974, should now be increased again. The Government is giving consideration to this submission in the context of the present economic situation, the excessive level of demand prevailing in the building industry and its many other competing commitments. </para>

            <para>The International Committee of the Red Cross is to convene a meeting of Government weaponry experts at Lucerne, Switzerland, from 24 September to 18 October 1974. Australia, along with other countries, was invited by the ICRC to notify in writing by 31 July whether or not it was in favour of participation by experts nominated by the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South VietNam. The following is the relevant extract from the Australian reply: &#39;Australia could not support the participation by experts nominated by the PRG authorities acting as a government, and would have to abstain if, as is assumed, this is the question that the ICRC has put to governments. Australia would have no objections, however, if the PRG were invited to nominate experts to attend the conference as observers with the right to address the conference&#39;. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s decision followed a review of policy concerning attendance by the PRG at conferences where humanitarian issues are to be discussed. It reflects a change from the position taken at an earlier conference held under ICRC auspices, the Diplomatic Conference on Humanitarian Law convened in Geneva from 20 February to 29 March 1974, when the Australian delegation voted against a proposal to seat the PRG as a full i.e. governmental, member of the Conference. The Australian delegation would, however, have supported the participation of the PRG at that earlier conference in an observer capacity. </para>
