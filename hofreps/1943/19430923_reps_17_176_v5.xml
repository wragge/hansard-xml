During your&#39; brief occupancy of the chair in the last Parliament you discharged your functions with impartiality and considerable ability. Honorable members may rest assured that you will continue to act up to the highest traditions of the office. You follow a long line of distinguished men, and I am confident that during your period of office you will distinguish yourself and give complete satisfaction to all honorable members. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition desires to be associated with the congratulations that are offered to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> upon your appointment. While in the Senate just now listening to the remarks that were addressed to us by the Senior  Deputy  of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, I was much struck by the phrase used by  His  Honour, that we should &#34; retire to the place where you are to sit and there proceed to the choice of some proper person to be your  Speaker  &#34;. Oddly enough, even then I had the vague idea that, you, sir, would be that proper person. You occupied the chair for only a brief period in the last Parliament, but it was sufficiently long to imbue every honorable member with the confident belief that you would be a remarkably successful  Speaker.  If you will permit me to catalogue them, I may say that you possess all the qualities that are needed by the occupant of the chair, namely, marked ability, great good humour, a ready wit, and a sound knowledge of the procedure of this House. You also have exhibited the quality of impartiality. If I may say so, you will need to exercise that quality in this Parliament; because the Government is now &#34; compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses&#34; that you will find it necessary to keep your head permanently inclined to the left if you are not to do more than justice to the right. I am sure that you will do that. We all congratulate you. </para>

You held that position with marked ability, conscientiousness, and impartiality for a period during which we who sit on this side of the House had the opportunity to gain evidence of your qualifications.

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Mr.FORDE  (Capricornia -  Deputy  Prime Minister). - I regret to inform honorable members of the death on the 20th August last of the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Hill Irvine, formerly Lieutenant-Governor and Chief Justice of Victoria and earlier a member of the House of Representatives and Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. </para>
      <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine had a very successful career embracing law and politics, the latter covering both State and Commonwealth spheres. He was elected in September, 1894, to the Legislative Assembly, Victoria, for Lowan, which seat he held till the 25th June, 1906, when he resigned. He held several ministerial offices. He was Attorney-General from December, 1899 to November, 1900, and Premier from June, 1902, to February, 1904, holding with that office the portfolio of Attorney-General till July, 1903, and afterwards that of Treasurer. </para>
      <para>Turning his political activitiesto the federal sphere, he was elected to the House of Representatives for Flinders, Victoria, at the general elections in 1906.  1910, 1913, 1914  and 1917. He became Attorney-General in June, 1913, and held that office until September, 1914. He resigned his seat in this House in April,  1918,  uponhis appointment as Chief Justice of the State of Victoria. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of that State on the 8th October, 1918. </para>
      <para>Possessing qualities of mind of a very high order, he devoted himself unsparingly to the service of his country. He assumed the task of guiding the people of Victoria during a period of very great difficulty in the history of that State.  His  entry later to federal politics gave further scope for the exercise of his great talents.  His  wide scholarship, devotion to duty and dignified courtesy earned the deep esteem of his fellow men. Not alone the State of Victoria, but the whole of Australia, I believe, derived material benefit from the eminent services which he rendered and we pay homage to the memory of a great Australian. I move - </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the Opposition, I second the motion. It was my proud privilege to know <inline font-weight="bold">Sir &#34;William</inline> Irvine very well, both as a politician and as a lawyer, and I shall always look back to him as one of the very great Australians of my time. He had great scholarship; he had great character; he had great courage, and, perhaps above all. he had great honesty of mind. As an advocate, as a statesman and as a judge, he served this country as, I believe, few men have served it. In those circumstances, we do very well to remember his work and his character, because the history and the progress of any country depend upon the quality of the men and women who serve it. Australia, I believe, was very fortunate indeed to attract first the life and then the service of such a man as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, and I shall remember him very distinctly as one who has very profoundly influenced my own life and occasionally, I hope, influenced my own conduct. The Opposition joins with the Government in its expression of regret and sympathy on this occasion. </para>

In the past, Flinders has been very fortunate in having as its representatives men of great distinction. Amongst previous representatives none served this country better in a wide sphere of offices than the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine. He was, as the  Deputy  Prime Minister pointed out, for twelve years the member for Flinders and he rendered excellent service. There are few Australians, I think, in any sphere of life who have sh own more selfless devotion to duty over a wide range of positions, including the most eminent that could be bestowed, than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine. He was a man of the highest integrity and character, liberally endowed with great qualities, a man to be admired.  His  memory will remain as an inspiration to all those in public life to-day who are shouldering the burdens which he bore so long and so honorably. </para>

          <para>. - It is with sincere regret that I refer to the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honorable James Cunningham, which took place at Albury on the 4th July last. The late James Cunningham had a leng and distinguished record of service as a representative of the people, having sat as a member of each House of the Western Australian Parliament, as well as in the capacity of a senator in the Commonwealth Parliament. . He was first  elected to the Legislative Council of Western Australia for North East Province at the by-election on the 7th July, 1916. He was defeated at the election in 1.922 but was elected to the Legislative Assembly in January, 1923 at the byelection for Kalgoorlie, which seat he held until defeated at the general election in 1936. He served as an honorary Minister from the 16th April, 1924, to the 15th December, 1927, and as Minister for Goldfields and Agricultural Water Supplies from the 15th December, 1927, to the 23rd April, 1940. He was elected to the Senate for Western Australia at the general election on the 23rd October, 1937, taking his seat from that date. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from December, 1937, to August, 1940. Fie was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from the 10th September, 1940, until the 1st July, 1941, when he was appointed President of the Senate. He held this high office at the time of his death. His personal qualities endeared him to all members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, regardless of party. The late  senatoll  was a stalwart of the Labour movement in Western Australia in which, first as a trade union organizer and later as a representative in parliament, he gave loyal and faithful service. He will be remembered for the very dee &#93; interest which he displayed in the welfare of the workers of that State, particularly the miners, and later the workers and miners throughout, Australia.  His  administration as a member of the Government of Western Australia was performed in the same capable and thorough manner as characterized all the work that he undertook in the course of his public duties.  His  occupancy of the presidential chair of the Senate was marked by courtesy and dignity, backed by a thorough knowledge of parliamentary procedure. The loss of the late James Cunningham will be felt by the whole nation, but particularly by the State of Western Australia and a wide circle of friends to whom he endeared himself by his sterling character and kindly disposition. We extend our sincere sympathy to his widow and family, to whom the loss is irreparable. We trust that they will be comforted in the knowledge that he served his country well and was well beloved by his fellow men. As a  tribute to the service which he rendered to the Commonwealth and to the State of Western Australia, the late President of the Senate was accorded  a  State funeral. I move - </para>

Those of us who are not members of the party to which the late honorable senator belonged, knew him best in his life at  Canberra,  and every member of the Opposition in both chambers regarded him as  a  friend. The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said quite truly that his tenure of office as  President  of the Senate was marked by great courtesy and competence, and he added to those qualities a  genial and unaffected friendliness and  a  wise experience which impressed all members of both Houses very much. His sudden death - his most unexpected death - came as  a  great shock to members of this Parliament, and honorable members on this side of the chamber certainly desire to be associated most warmly in the message of condolence to the bereaved family. </para>

He rendered  to  the Labour movement loyal and honest service that inspired other people  to  work for the promotion of its ideals. He was  a  man of great ability. At first  he  served the Labour movement in .an honorary capacity ; later  he  was appointed secretary of  a  trade union. He entered the legislative halls  of  Western Australia, and subsequently was elected  to  the Parliament of the Commonwealth and was quickly elevated  to  the high and honorable office of  President  of the Senate. The late senator had friends throughout the Commonwealth. He was, in every sense of the word,  a  &#34;big&#34; Australian. He studied  all  questions from the national standpoint.

          <para>.. - I sincerely regret  to  inform honorable members of the death on the 21st July last of the Honorable  David John O&#39;Keefe,  a  former senator and member of the House of Representatives, and later  Speaker  of the Tasmanian  House  of Assembly. He and I were amongst the members who entered the Parliament following the election in 1922. I always regarded him  as  one of my dearest friends, and his passing will cause sorrow  to all  honorable members who were associated with him. He had  a  very  long and  varied parliamentary career. Prior  to  his death  he  was one of the small band of surviving mem&#39;bers of the first Commonwealth Parliament. He was elected  to  the Senate for Tasmania  at  the general election in 1901. Defeated  at  the general election in 1906,  he  was again elected  to  the Senate  at  the general elections of 1910 and 1914. He was Chairman of Committees from 1910 to 1914 and ,was a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in 19.1 J-18. At the general election :of 19.19 he w.as again defeated, but was elected to the House of Representatives for -Denison, Tasmania, at the general election in 1922. He lost that seat in 19.25 and unsuccessfully contested the Senate elections in 1931. In 1934, he turned his attention to .State politics and gained election to the Tasmanian House of Assembly., -as the representative of the constituency of Wilmot. Subsequently, he became Speaker of that chamber and held that high office until 1941. In that year he was awarded the distinction of Companion of the Order of &#39;S:t. Michael and St. George. The late David O&#39;Keefe was one of the (pioneers of the Labour movement and for years was a member of the Federal Executive of the Australian Labour party. He was held in high esteem, not on&#39;ly by those whose views were similar to his own, but also by all his political opponents as a forthright man who had strong convictions but who was tolerant of the views of others. He shared in the foundation of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and with several short breaks continued to be associated with the Parliament for 25 years. This .long period of national service, together with his subsequent career in the State legislature, testified to the confidence and high regard in which he was held by the people of Tasmania. In recognition of the service which he rendered to the Commonwealth and to Tasmania, the deceased gentleman was accorded a -State funeral. I hope that it will be some consolation to his sorrowing family to know that his passing is mourned not only in this Parliament but also by a large circle of friends throughout Australia.

          <para>. - I second the motion and associate the members of the tinted Australia party with it. I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Riley</inline> very well. He was one of my oldest and best friends. As the  Deputy  Prime Minister has said, he was for 21 years a member of this Parliament, during which time as fellow members our relations were intimate and cordial. But I was closely associated with him long before the establishment of Federation. In the very early days of the Labour movement in New South Wales he was one of the most active and stalwart fighters in both the industrial and political wings of Labour. The value of his services was recognized by the industrial movement at whose instance he was appointed assessor in the first Arbitration Court of New South Wales and I had the honour of appearing before him in many cases. He made no enemies for he was what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson</inline> calls a &#34; clubbable man and men of all shades of political opinion were glad to call him their friend. But beneath his genial disposition he was a man who stood fast by great principles and spoke his mind boldly.  His  name will live, for he did yeoman work in the Labour movement when to be a Labour man was to be a pariah, an outcast. It was with very great regret that I heard of the death of &#34; Ted &#34; Riley which occurred quite suddenly, for I had arranged with his son-in-law to visit him. I held the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riley</inline> in the highest esteem and conceived for bini great affection. Our friendly relations remained unaffected by differences of political opinion. He was a man of fine character who devoted himself to advancing the interests of his fellow men. I deeply mourn his loss, and join with the  Deputy  Prime Minister in expressing profound sympathy with his bereaved relatives. </para>

Those of us who were his contemporaries in the Commonwealth Parliament remember him as a forthright man of great individuality and independence, who did not hesitate to express, in the most eloquent terms, the very strong convictions that he held.

          <para>. - I second the motion. It was not my pleasure to know the late honorable gentleman; but the particulars that have been given to the House by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> show that his career was typical of many useful careers in the public life of Australia. He served the one electorate in the State Parliament for no fewer than thirteen years, and then served the same district in the Commonwealth Parliament for another three years. That fact, in itself, speaks volumes for the respect in which he must have been held by his constituents. I am sure that what has been said by the  Deputy  Prime Minister accurately describes the character in which he impressed himself on this House. The Opposition associates itself with the motion, and with the sentiments in which it has been proposed. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Australian Country party, and of his old colleagues, I pay tribute to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitsitt,</inline> a former member for Darwin, who had a very lengthy association with the public life ofAustralia in both this Parliament and the Parliament of Tasmania. In his youth he had been a banker, and a very keen student of economics. He then became a farmer, and an even keener student&#39; of rural economics.  His  convictions in regard to the methods that should be adopted in the handling of both of those subjects were deeply held, and when he was stirred his eloquence, as the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said, emerged - in a teeming flood. I recall that on one occasion he made in the space of nine minutes a speech which, when recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> consisted of 5,000 words; and my impression is that all his words were not recorded. He was easily the most eloquent and rapid speaker that this Parliament has known. He was a very warmhearted, as well as an impulsive, man, and a great friend of the people. His early years were passed in close association with medical men, from whom he acquired a great deal of knowledge. During the whole of his life he was a great friend of all his neighbours; in fact, Dame Enid Lyons has told me that he was known in Darwin as the good neighbour, of all the people there. We do well in associating ourselves with the motion proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister, expressing our recognition of the value of the work that he did in both his public and his private capacities. </para>
