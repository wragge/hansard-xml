                            - Has the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service been drawn to the statement by Mr. Wurth, Director-General of Man Power, which I have no doubt is official, published in to-day&#39;s Sydney press,that the shortage of dentists for civilian requirements is due to enlistments? Can the honorable gentleman state how he reconciles it with a statement ina letter that I hav  received from Mr. Bellemore, Deputy Director of Man Power in New South Wales, that a certain dentist upon whose behalf I had made representations has been instructed to close his dental practice and report to the Army authorities? If the shortage of dentists for civilian requirements is as pressing as it is represented to be, will the honorable gentleman consider the release of a number of dentists whose services have, been requisitioned by the Army? </para>

                        <para>- -Recently. I questioned the Minister for Labour and&#39; National Service with respect to the employment of two youths aged respectively sixteen and a half years and seventeen years. The position offered . to one was that of a cadet in a Sydney newspaper office, whilst the other had been accepted by the Public Service Board forappointment as an apprentice to the electrical&#39; maintenance staff. The Man Power  Directorate refused to permit either of the boys to take up the position offered to Mr. Will the Minister state what justification there is for this industrial conscription of young lads? Cannot some means be devised to enable such youths to  found their careers pending their attainment of the age of eighteen years, when they become subject to the usual call-up ?</para>

                        <para> The problem is a difficult one. Upon reaching the age of eighteen years, lads become liable to military service, and any training previously undertaken is interrupted unless it be established that the work they are doing, or the profession or craft they are following, is in a more essential category. Many boys aged sixteen and a half years have been given the work of filling cartridge cases. I have not yet been advised1 of the reason that operated in respect of the youth of that age whose case has been referred to me by the honorable member, but it will probably be that he is doing more essential work in the filling of cartridge cases than he would be doing were he employed in the  <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> newspaper office. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Minister for Repatriation whether it is a fact that of servicemen discharged on medical grounds approximately only 25 per cent, are entitled to medical treatment for the causes of their discharge? Does not the Minister consider that free medical treatment for a period of at least one year would be a proper feature of rehabilitation if the men discharged are to be given a full opportunity to become restored as far as practicable to normal health?</para>

                    <para> The Empire Air Training Scheme is based upon an agreement between Australia and the other dominions and Great Britain. Any alteration of the agreement asit now stands must be considered in relation to the man-power of Australia, a problem which is now being investigated. A review of the scheme would necessarily involve Government policy, and I cannot make an announcement upon it in answer to a question.</para>

                            <para>- This matter has already received consideration, and some men have been brought back from Great Britain and other spheres of operation. However, the honorable member will understand that, in order to make a complete change-over along the lines he has suggested, a very heavy demand would be made on transport, and up to the present sufficient transport has not been available. As a matter of general policy, men must be required to serve where they can best promote the safety of Australia, but bearing that in mind, consideration is being given to the rotation of air crews.</para>

                            - I do not know whether the statements which the honorable member has put forward are correct. They may be; I shall find out. As was announced yesterday by the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Mr. Beasley),I am holding a conference early next week with officers of the unions concerned, and at that meeting the requirements of Australia in respect of coal will be thoroughly reviewed. I regret these stoppages. They are detrimental to the war effort, but the men involved are Australian citizens and they have grievances. Some are legitimate; others are, I think, just excuses for other purposes which the men may have in mind. The problem of coal production is as acute in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America as it is in Australia. Coal-miners are engaged in a most hazardous and laborious occupation. This is not a matter for generalization, nor is it easy to decide how best to obtain increased coal production. If the problem were as simple as some honorable members seem to suggest, I am quite certain that increased production would be obtained.

                        <para>- In reply to questions by the honorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt), I promised to make a statement in regard to the distribution of beef in Victoria and New South Wales. The information which the honorable member used as the basis of his questions is incorrect. Meat supplies in both States have been affected by the action taken to prevent the normal movement of beef south from Queensland, where it is urgently required to meet service and civilian requirements. In both New South Wales and Victoria service demands for beef in the fresh and frozen form, and for canning are extensive. Some months ago, it was foreseen that, unless action were taken to control distribution of beef in both States, difficulties would arise in fulfilling service demands, and particularly the demands of the canneries for beef for canned meat packs. In order to safeguard the position, an order was issued by the Controller of Meat Supplies, directing that, from the 10th May, 1943, one forequarter of each body of beef over 400 lb., slaughtered in or coming into the County of Cumberland, New South Wales, should be diverted to the canneries. A few weeks later, arrangements were made with certain operators in Sydney by which all service demands for fresh and frozen beef were met, and specific quantities set aside for reserves. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The position in Victoria did not develop acutely until later. It was found necessary to promulgate an order on the 21st June, 1943, under which canner cows were diverted to the canneries. This order was followed on the 16th August, 1943, by a further order in  similar terms to that already operating in New South Wales whereby forequarters in the metropolitan area of Melbourne were diverted for canning. In order to help the position in Melbourne, forequarters in the Adelaide metropolitan area were diverted, transported  to Melbourne and distributed to the canneries.</para>
                    <para>By arrangement with the trade in each State, the quota system of distribution was introduced on the 6th September, 1943. Under this system, which had been operating in Western Australia since March, 1943, the total quantity of beef coming into a particular  area over a given period is determined. After making provision for service and other essential needs, which must be met from within the State, a percentage quota, in accordance with the consumption of beef during the basic period, is arrived at. Supplies are then made available by wholesalers to retailers for equitable distribution to the  consuming public. The quota of beef for civilian consumption in both New South Wales and Victoria during this week has been 33-1 per cent, of the basic period. The forequarter beef, together with other classes diverted to the canners, is included in both. States in the 66$ per cent, which is required for service and other essential needs, including ships&#39; stores, hospitals, &#38;c.</para>
                    <para>It is clear, therefore, that there has been no differential treatment in regard to the distribution of beef in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales the operation of the quota system was impeded by the strike at the Homebush Abattoirs from the 3rd to the 13th September, whilst the position in Victoria has been made more difficult by the reduction of the number of trucks made available for the carriage of live-stock. Honorable members will appreciate that, in order to meet urgent and pressing demands made on short notice - demands which must be filled within the State from which delivery is to be made - there may be occasions when the quota will vary from State to State. Honorable members are assured, however, that every effort will ,be made to avoid differential treatment as between the States. As I mentioned yesterday, the rationing of meat is a matter of Government policy, and will receive consideration.</para>

Such men were released during the last war, and I assume that it can be done again.</para>

                    <para class="block">When I brought down the budget last year, Australia was still facing
            the threat of invasion. To meet that grave danger our fighting forces were mobilized to
            their utmost. All other considerations had to be put aside. The immediate danger to this
            country has now passed, but victory is yet to be won and nothing less than our utmost
            efforts will suffice.</para>
                    <para>It is essential, however, that our efforts be re-organized not only to take account
            of the definite limit to our physical resources but also to ensure such balance between
            our military and civil activities as will make a maximum contribution to the allied war
            effort.</para>
                    <para>As already announced, the Government intends to make an early and comprehensive
            review of the Australian war programme. This review will not result in any lessening of
            our efforts, but it will necessarily involve some changes in the order of priorities
            obtaining during the crisis period.</para>
                    <para>In these circumstances, I feel that it is appropriate to sketch the nature and
            extent of the physical effort we have already made, to indicate the type of problem
            which now confronts us, and to summarize the way in which our past efforts and present

                <para>The use of man-power and womanpower is the best evidence of the magnitude of our war
          effort. Since the outbreak of war the total working population has risen from 2,750,000 to
          3,370,000 persons, an increase of 620,000. This has been achieved by bringing into work
          250,000 persons previously unemployed and 220,000 persons who do not normally seek work.
          The natural growth of the working population accounts for the remaining 150,000.</para>
                <para>Of the present working population 1,370,000, or over 40 per cent., are now engaged in
          the fighting forces or in defence construction and the manufacture of munitions. In
          addition, a substantial number of workers is producing food, clothing and other essential
          suppliesand services for both our own and Allied forces. Including these, more than 50 per
          cent, of the entire working population is engaged in the war effort.</para>
                <para>Nearly the whole of the remainder of our workers is engaged in essential work -
          feeding and clothing the civil population and producing the essential minimum of other
          goods and services. Inevitably the transfer of workers to the forces and munitions
          production has involved a great reduction of the civilian goods and services available.</para>
                <para>This great diversion of the working population from civil requirements to war needs
          has about reached its limit. For some time past, the increased numbers available have been
          small, even with the most determined combing out of unessential industry. Supplies
          required for our own forces and Allied forces, for our commitments for food to Britain,
          and for essential civil needs are together getting greater than our capacity to produce
          them, and shortages of essential supplies have been developing in various directions.</para>
                <para>It is for these reasons that we must now review the war programme as a whole, so as to
          take into account the limits of man-power and make sure that it is being used, not for
          good purposes, but for only the best possible purposes. We have mobilized almost our
          maximum manpower, and we must make certain that it is used to optimum effect.</para>

                <para>Despite the fact that 30 per cent, of men formerly working on farms have joined the
          forces or entered other work, production of some foodstuffs has been maintained at
          satisfactory levels and in some cases increased beyond pre-war averages. Having regard to
          other impediments to production such as shortages of petrol, fertilizer and processed
          fodders, as well as the general transport and man-power stringency, this has been a great
          achievement.</para>
                <para>But the position in recent months has engaged the earnest attention of the </para>
                <para class="block">Government, first, because production is hampered by indifferent
          seasonal conditions plus signs of fatigue and stress in some sections of rural industry,
          and secondly, because Australia is now being asked to provide more food for the United
          Kingdom and vastly more for Allied forces in and around Australia in addition to food for
          certain other theatres of war.</para>
                <para>To meet this situation, the Government some months ago established a Food Control and
          Directorate of Agriculture under the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to take the
          position vigorously in hand.</para>
                <para>It is clear that thorough-going measures must be taken, and already action is
          proceeding on a wide front through local organizations. Increased supplies of farm
          machinery are now flowing through. . Action is being taken to ascertain and provide as far
          as possible farmers&#39; exact needs for fertilizers and other essential materials. The
          two main impediments to expansion of production are transport, both road and rail, and
          man-power. Special attention is now being given to these. The overcoming of both is bound
          up with the re-alignment of Australia&#39;s total war effort to accord with current
          strategic needs.</para>

                <para>The drastic mobilization of our physical resources which I have outlined is reflected
          in the striking increase in our monthly rate of war expenditure. Last month the war cost
          &#163;47,000,000, compared with &#163;20,000,000 in the corresponding month of 1941 and
          only &#163;11,000,000 in August, 1940. The current rate of outlay represents about half of
          the entire national income of Australia.</para>
                <para>By the 30th June last the total cost of the war had reached &#163;1,107,000,000. Of
          this expenditure, &#163;363,000,000 was provided from taxation, &#163;474,000,000 from
          loans, &#163;11,000,000 from temporary use of Treasury funds, and the balance of
          &#163;259,000,000 was raised by discounting treasury-bills with the Commonwealth Bank.</para>

                <para>Within limits, a well-balanced system of taxationis the most efficient and equitable
          method of meeting the cost of the war. It makes a direct reduction of the volume of
          civilian spending and it leaves no war debts upon which interest and sinking fund payments
          have to be made in the post-war years.</para>
                <para>This Government has imposed drastic war-time increases of taxation and in addition has
          introduced uniform income taxation which has preserved to the Commonwealth for war
          purposes the increased yields due to rising incomes. This year it is expected that total
          taxation receipts will exceed &#163;270,000,000, compared with about &#163;74,000,000 in
          1938-39. In general the burden of Australian taxation is now as severe as in any other
          allied country.</para>

                <para>In spite of the increased revenue obtained from taxation it has been essential to rely
          on loans to a considerable extent, and as a result debt incurred in respect of- the
          present war amounted to &#163;731,000,000 at the 30th June last.</para>
                <para>This increase of debt is building up a post-war obligation for the payment of
          interest. For the current year interest on these war loans amounts to about
          &#163;20,000,000, and this must necessarily increase each year the war continues.</para>
                <para>The new debt, however, is almost entirely ah internal one, and although the payment of
          the interest on it involves a transfer of funds within the community, it does not reduce
          the income of Australia as a whole.</para>
                <para>In spite of the war-time increases, the burden of Commonwealth and State government
          debt is less now in relation to the national income than it has been for most of the last
          20 years. Total interest payable here and abroad is now about 5 J per cent, of the
          national income, compared with 7 per cent, in 1935.</para>
                <para>There can be no doubt of our capacity to pay interest even on a greatly increased war
          debt and to reduce it gradually by substantial sinking fund contributions. It will of
          course be necessary to maintain taxation at levels sufficient to meet these obligations
          together with our other essential post-war needs.</para>

                <para>Treasury-bills account for &#163;259,000,000 of the increase in our debt. This use of
          treasury-bill finance reflects the size of the abnormal governmental expenditures required
          by the demands of war. In spite of our great efforts by way of taxation increases and loan
          subscriptions, the use of treasury-bills to this amount has been unavoidable.</para>
                <para>The danger of treasury-bill finance is that it builds up new purchasing power in the
          hands of the public at the very time when the Government is acquiring for war purposes an
          increasing proportion of the productive resources normally devoted to civilian use. The
          Government, however, has established direct controls to ensure that the excess spending
          power remaining in the hands of the public is . prevented from causing a continuous rise
          of prices and an inequitable distribution of the goods available for civilian consumption.</para>

                <para>At the same time price control ensures that civilian goods available for purchase are
          sold at reasonable prices.</para>
                <para>The price stabilization policy which I explained in my financial statement last June
          is a further development of the wartime control of prices. Until April, prices were
          adjusted only to cover increased costs. The price ceiling is a sign of the
          Government&#39;s intention to control not only prices but also costs. The plan is now
          operating smoothly.</para>
                <para>
                    An important measure within the price stabilization scheme was announced on the 20th
          July. Owing to seasonal price movements and to difficulties connected with the transition
          from one type of price control to another, it was necessary to offset certain increases of
          prices. The need for such action had been anticipated when the ceiling was introduced, and
          the Government took the necessary steps immediately it was advised of the extent and
          nature of the rise. The price of tea was reduced by ls.
                    <inline font-style="italic">2d.</inline>
                    per lb. to its pre-war level, and a standard maximum price for potatoes of
          5 lb. for 6d. was declaredin all capital cities. Sales tax on clothing and textiles was
          also reduced from 12&#163; per cent, to
                    <inline font-style="italic">1-\</inline>
                    per cent.
                </para>
                <para>The commodities were selected on three grounds. In the first place, the administrative
          problems can be handled easily through the Tea Board, the Potato Committee and the Sales
          Tax Department. Secondly, they were all commodities whose prices had risen markedly.
          Thirdly, and most important, they were universally consumed commodities which ensured that
          the reduction of prices was enjoyed by all consumers. By operating only on such
          commodities, we were able to secure the necessary reduction in each individual&#39;s cost
          of living, even though</para>
                <para>Ave operated on only a few commodities. </para>
                <para>At the same time, special arrangements have been made to refund to employers the
          increased wage costs incurred by them, but which they cannot recover by price increases.
          This refund should be payable for only a limited period, as it is hoped that the cost of
          living will soon be restored to its level in the March quarter.</para>
                <para>By imposing a price ceiling on the 12th April, the Government took responsibility for
          putting a limit on prices. That limit will not remain indefinitely at the present figure,
          but some limit there must be under the disturbed conditions of war and of the immediate
          post-war period. The importance of such control for preventing the inflation of prices
          always likely to follow the conclusion of war will be easily appreciated.</para>

                <para>I said earlier that nothing less than our utmost efforts would suffice to&#39; carry
          this war to a successful end. There can be no relaxation on the home front because our
          operations in the field are going well. Even if there is some lessening of the demand for
          men and munitions, there is a greater demand for supplies of all kinds for our own and the
          allied nations. We cannot look for increased freedom to spend until after the war is won.
          Restrictions on consumption must be fully maintained and probably increased, and it must
          not be expected that they can be suddenly relaxed in the immediate postwar period. With
          the new assurance of ultimate victory, I hope we can submit to these necessary
          restrictions with patience and good temper, knowing now with certainty that the sacrifice
          will not have been made in vain.</para>

                <para>The prosecution of the war has inevitably involved the Commonwealth in considerable
          expenditure overseas, both for the maintenance of troops and also for war supplies and
          equipment obtained from other countries. To the 30th June last, our total war expenditure
          overseas was &#163;178,000,000. In addition we still have some heavy liabilities to the
          United Kingdom Government for war equipment and supplies in respect of which accounts have
          not yet been rendered.</para>
                <para>Under the satisfactory arrangements made with the United Kingdom Government for the
          purchase of our entire wool clip, a major part of our export income has been safeguarded
          for the period of the war. Other export income has also been well maintained in spite of
          shipping difficulties. Imports for civil purposes have been severely reduced. In the
          aggregate, our overseas earnings in the four years now past have been more than sufficient
          to cover all overseas payments including war expenditure.</para>
                <para>
                    Accordingly, apart from the &#163;12,000,000 sterling loan raised in London by the
          previous Government, it has not been necessary to borrow overseas for war purposes. This
          loan is now being repaid under the arrangement made with the United Kingdom Government by
          the Attorney-General
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline>
                    in 1941-42, which
          provided for its repayment when the level of our London funds permitted. After allowing
          for this repayment and the effect of sinking fund operations, Commonwealth and State
          overseas debt has actually been reduced by about &#163;9,000,000 sterling since the
          outbreak of war.

                <para>It is impossible to forecast the future movements in our overseas . income and
          payments with any accuracy, but we may hope that the present satisfactory position will
          continue. If it should not, we shall still have the benefit of the arrangement with the
          United Kingdom Government under which we can draw on that Government for assistance to our
          London funds.</para>
                <para>Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid. &#34;When the President of the United States of America
          instituted the plan known as lend-lease he made a striking and far-reaching contribution
          to the cause of the Allies.</para>
                <para>Under that arrangement Australia has received valuable assistance in the form of war
          equipment and essential goods. The first consignments were received in September, 1941,
          and since then we have continued to receive an increasing flow of goods. I am not in a
          position to quote values, but I may say that both the volume and the range of lend-lease
          goods are very considerable. For instance, they embrace such items as: - Aircraft and
          parts, armoured fighting vehicles, weapons and parts, ammunition, motor vehicles and
          petroleum products, machine and hand tools, radio and electrical machinery; and raw
          materials, including tin-plate, metals, woodpulp, chemicals and .minerals.</para>
                <para>We are deeply grateful to the people of the United States of America for their
          splendid and generous contribution, which came at a time when our need was great. For our
          part we are happy to be in a position to give assistance in return - known as reciprocal
          aid - to the American forces in Australia and the South-West Pacific Area. This consists
          of food supplies, clothing, buildings, aerodromes, aircraft maintenance, transport, ships
          and shipping repairs, and many other items. &#39;The aid we are now giving is assuming
          considerable proportions. The cost of reciprocal aid last year was &#163;59,000,000 and
          this year it is expected to reach almost &#163;100,000,000, or approximately one-sixth of
          our total war expenditure. The principle of lendlease and reciprocal aid is that each
          country shall make maximum contributions from its own resources. The resources of the
          United States of America greatly exceed those of Australia, and despite the many claims on
          the production of the United States of America, the lend-lease aid given to Australia has
          substantially exceeded the aid that we have been able to give in return. There is no
          adequate measuring stick to compare the contribution made by each country. Many forms of
          aid do not lend themselves to expression in money values, and it would be contrary to the
          spirit of lendlease that a money comparison should be made. Australia commenced to receive
          lend-lease aid in September, 1941, whereas for our part reciprocal aid did not commence
          until March, 1942. Since then reciprocal aid has increased rapidly, and our present rate
          of aid is one of which we can reasonably feel proud.</para>

                <para>I turn now to the accounts of last year. Total expenditure last year was
          &#163;670,305,000. Of this amount, war expenditure accounted for &#163;561,743,000. When
          announcing the budget estimate of &#163;440,000,000 for war expenditure last September, I
          warned honorable members that the figure might be exceeded. As our war effort gathered
          strength during the year, it became clear that the estimate would be greatly exceeded, and
          in the Financial Statement of last February I lifted the estimate to &#163;540,000,000,
          and again in June to &#163;560,000,000.</para>
                <para>War expenditure in Australia absorbed &#163;483,050,000, and overseas
          &#163;78,693,000. On supplies and services for other governments, other than reciprocal
          aid, &#163;25,879,000 was expended, but payments received during the year for current and
          past supplies exceeded this amount by &#163;1,180,000, reducing the charge on the budget
          accordingly.</para>
                <para>Revenue collections for the year proved to be &#163;267,453,000, excluding the amount
          of &#163;27,006,000 due to the States for tax reimbursement, or &#163;17,772,000 above the
          budget estimate of &#163;249,681,000.</para>
                <para>After meeting non-war expenditure, including tax reimbursement payments to States, the
          revenue budget provided &#163;158,891,000 towards war expenditure. To the balance of
          &#163;402,852,000, public loans and war savings certificates contributed
          &#163;215,357,000. The temporary use of treasury balances provided &#163;8,420,000, whilst
          &#163;179,075,000 was financed by treasury-bills discounted with the Commonwealth Bank.</para>

                <para>In November, 1942, &#163;82,686,000 was raised for war purposes. In conjunction with
          this loan, the opportunity was taken to submit a conversion operation for the 3J per cent,
          loan of &#163;22,700,000 which matured on the loth December, 1942. Conversions reached
          &#163;21,777,000, representing 96 per cent, of the amount outstanding. The amount not
          converted, &#163;923,000, is being met from the National Debt .Sinking Fund. The Third
          Liberty Loan in March last yielded &#163;101,822,000. The total of &#163;184,508,000
          raised through the two public loans, together with the conversion of nearly
          &#163;21,800,000, marks a new level in the efforts of the general public to meet the
          demands for war finance. Net proceeds of sales of war savings certificates and stamps
          totalled &#163;9,158,000. Since its inception, this scheme has raised &#163;35,529,000.
          National savings bonds bearing interest at 3 per cent, produced &#163;9:39,000.
          Interest-free loans of &#163;295,000, and gifts of &#163;223,000 were also received. The
          aggregates from these two sources are &#163;6,350,000 and &#163;1,618,000 respectively. In
          1942-43, total cash receipts from all loan sources, including advance subscriptions, were
          &#163;215,357,000.</para>
                <para>Commonwealth and States&#39; contributions for the redemption of public debt through
          the National Debt Sinking Fund continue to increase. During the year, &#163;17,668,000 was
          provided, and it is anticipated that &#163;20,720,000 will be available in the current
          year for this purpose. The aggregate debt of the Commonwealth and the States at the 30th
          June, 1943, was &#163;2,006,000,000, being &#163;1,107,000,000 for the Commonwealth and
          &#163;899,000,000 for the States. The increase last year of &#163;389,000,000 in
          Commonwealth debt was entirely due to the war. Cash resources available to the States were
          used for the temporary redemption of treasury-bills during the year. This, together with
          the operations of the sinking fund, brought about a reduction of &#163;12,000,000 in
          States&#39; debt. No public loans were raised for the States during the year, and State
          loan expenditure was wholly financed from balances held by them.</para>

                <para>Revenue from all sources for 1943-44 is expected to reach &#163;312,087,000, which
          exceeds last year&#39;s collections by &#163;44,634,000. This large increase is mainly due
          to income tax. Including companies, income tax is expected to produce &#163;160,233,000
          this year, an improvement of &#163;45,637,000 on last year&#39;s collections.</para>
                <para>A decline of &#163;3,306,000 is expected in customs, as a result of the greatly
          reduced volume of civil imports. Excise is estimated to increase by &#163;2,428,000,
          mainly on account of the increased rates imposed in September, 1942. The volume of sales
          liable to sales tax has been declining over the last two or three years as a direct result
          of war controls, and sales tax on clothing and textiles was recently reduced from 12&#163;
          per cent, to 7^ per cent, under the price stabilization plan. Because of these facts, it
          is anticipated that sales tax will decline by &#163;3,346,000, compared with 1942-43. A
          full year&#39;s revenue from the Commonwealth entertainments tax introduced last year will
          be collected this year, and as a result it is estimated that collections will exceed last
          year&#39;s figure by &#163;1,014,000.</para>
                <para>From all sources, the anticipated yield of taxation is &#163;272,767,000, which is
          &#163;42,630,000 more than last year&#39;s collections.</para>
                <para>From sources other than taxation, it is anticipated that revenue will reach
          &#163;39,320,000, or &#163;2,004,000 in excess of last year. An improvement of the return
          from business undertakings is expected. Compared with last year, it is forecast that the
          Post Office will yield an additional &#163;1,609,000 and the railways &#163;883,000.</para>

                <para>Our statutory obligations to the States for income tax reimbursement grants amount to
          &#163;33,489,000 annually. Last year, we collected on behalf of the States &#163;7,058,000
          of arrears of State income taxes, leaving &#163;26,431,000 as the direct charge on the
          Commonwealth revenue. It is expected that &#163;1,222,000 arrears of State income taxes
          will be collected in the current year, so that the payments to the States on account of
          income tax reimbursement grants, to be provided by the budget, total &#163;32,267,000,
          which represents an increase of &#163;5,836,000 on last year&#39;s figure.</para>
                <para>
                    We also have obligations to the States in respect of entertainments tax. In September
          last, Parliament passed the States Grants (Entertainments Tax Reimbursement) Act, under
          which the Commonwealth undertakes to make yearly grants to the States in consideration of
          their leaving the entertainments tax field for the duration of the war and one year
          thereafter. For 1942-43, the total amount paid to the States under this act was
          &#163;574,341
                    <inline font-style="italic">;</inline>
                    this year, and in future years, the

          industry. A subsidy at the rate of &#163;6,500,000 is now being paid to the industry
          .under the Dairying Industry Assistance Act 1943. In the current year it is expected that
          &#163;7,000,000 will actually be disbursed. This amount includes some payments applicable
          to 1942-43.</para>

                <para>For the 1942-43 wheat crop the Government introduced the plan by which licensed
          wheat-growers were paid 4s. a bushel, bagged basis, at growers&#39; sidings for the first
          3,000 bushels. For wheat in excess of the 3,000 bushels quota an advance of 2s. a bushel
          was paid. Although substantial unrealized stocks of wheat remain in the Government&#39;s
          hands it is intended to continue the plan for the 1943-44 crop. As realizations are
          averaging slightly more than 4s. a bushel at ports, the Government faces losses on the
          quota wheat. An amount of &#163;1,750,000 has been provided for the losses which will have
          to be met during the current financial year. In addition, &#163;550,000 is required to
          provide compensation for compulsorily reduced wheat acreage in Western Australia during
          the 1943-44 season.</para>

          to employers is estimated at &#163;1,500,000, about half of which, however, will be offset

                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>As an important contribution towards the budget for this financial year, the
          Government obtained the approval of Parliament in March last for increasing the rates and
          widening the field of income tax on individuals. Those increases take effect for the first
          time in the assessments for the present financial year. The yield this year is expected to
          exceed last year&#39;s collections by &#163;43,000,000. This will cover the requirements
          of the National Welfare Fund and will also make some provision for other expenditures. The
          latest increases will bring the yield of income tax on individuals for Commonwealth
          purposes to &#163;120,000,000. In the last pre-war year the yield from this source was
          about &#163;8,000,000. The total yield from all forms of taxation for Commonwealth
          purposes this year is estimated to produce &#163;273,000,000. &#39;</para>
                <para>There is one matter which comes within the taxation field which may conveniently be
          mentioned here. I refer to the question of the burden of income tax on falling incomes.
          With the existing high rates of taxation, taxpayers whose incomes fall may find themselves
          in some difficulty. The Government is not unmindful of this problem. The solution is not
          simple and the Government is, and has been, for some time, closely examining all aspects
          of the matter.</para>

                    <page.no>164</page.no>
                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>I have reviewed the financial results of last year and the forecasts for the current
          year. The estimates of revenue and expenditure can now be summarized as follows: -</para>
                <para>The anticipated payment to the States of &#163;33,033,000 for tax reimbursement grants
          to which I have already referred is omitted from both the figures of revenue and
          expenditure I have just stated.</para>
                <para>There are two aspects upon which I have something further to say. The first is war
          loan appeals. The response to our war loans is improving, but it still falls far short of
          what is necessary before Australians generally can be proud of their effort. .Subscribers
          to one loan last year numbered 455,000 - a record for Australia. In Canada, however,
          individual subscribers to one loan have reached 2,000,000. I shall not feel satisfied
          unless subscribers to our next loan exceed 750,000. In anticipation of the coming loan we
          have expanded our organization and it will make closer contacts with the various voluntary
          bodies throughout Australia. War loans are a means by which each person can take a share
          in the common struggle. It is the duty of every one to assist by personal subscriptions
          and by encouraging others to subscribe.</para>
                <para>Total contributions to public loans, &#38;c, last .year amounted to &#163;215,000,000.
          For this year the gap between expenditure and revenue is &#163;403,000,000. With the
          current level and volume of incomes, I see no reason why we cannot expect the public of
          Australia to subscribe to our public loans an aggregate of &#163;300,000,000. That would
          enable us to reduce very considerably our dependence on treasury-bills.</para>
                <para>It must be borne in mind that treasurybill finance piles up a body of excess spending
          power which threatens inflation unless consumption and spending are vigilantly controlled.
          It will be the accumulation of excess spending power at the end of the war which will make
          it necessary to prolong controls in the post-war period. The less the accumulation, the
          quicker controls can be removed and freedom restored.</para>
                <para class="block">The second matter is the urgent need to avoid unnecessary government ex-
          penditure. In the light of experience gained the Government will redouble its efforts to
          secure economies and to eliminate all wasteful expenditure. The financial proposals I have
          just summarized have been framed on that basis.</para>

                <para>During the year the Government&#39;s war-time control of banking proceeded smoothly.
          As a part of this control, honorable members will recall, each trading bank is required to
          deposit with the Commonwealth Bank a prescribed part of its surplus investible funds. In
          this way, the increased deposits coming to the banks as a result of war expenditure are
          prevented from being used as a basis for credit expansion. During the year, war-time
          deposits greatly increased. At the 30th June, 1943, the Commonwealth Bank held
          &#163;101,000,000 in war-time deposits of the trading banks, as compared with
          &#163;37,000,000 at the corresponding date in the previous year.</para>
                <para class="block">Post-war Reconstruction. </para>
                <para>Early in 1943, the Government set up the Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction. The
          Ministry will, in collaboration with other Commonwealth or State authorities, be
          responsible for planning the transition to a peace-time economy, and devising measures for
          obtaining a high level of employment and economic security in the post-war years. In this
          work the&#39; rehabilitation of demobilized service personnel will receive particular
          attention.</para>
                <para>As a practical means of planning a reservoir of work for the immediate postwar period
          and an orderly programme of developmental works, the Commonwealth and States, at the
          Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in July last, established a National Works
          Council. The Co-ordinator-General of Works will present to the Commonwealth Government at
          the earliest possible date a schedule, including both new works and maintenance projects
          that have been deferred during the war. This schedule will, of course, be discussed by the
          National Works Council to which I have just referred.</para>
                <para>Commissions have also been appointed within the Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction to
          prepare plans for housing in the post-war period, and to deal with questions relating to
          rural reconstruction.</para>
                <para>The acute shortage of dwelling accommodation, which is growing more serious with every
          month of war restriction, must be remedied as soon as our war commitments permit. The
          Commonwealth Housing Commission is already working to this end, and I hope to be able to
          make a more precise statement about the Government&#39;s plans on this matter in the near
          future.</para>
                <para>Although the immensely difficult task confronting the Rural Reconstruction Commission
          may take somewhat longer to complete, I expect to receive the commission&#39;s interim
          report on plans for soldier settlement and necessary reforms to rural finance before the
          end of 1943. As the result of a thorough investigation now being conducted by the
          commission, the plans made for land settlement should avoid the grave errors which marred
          similar schemes after the last war.</para>
                <para>The Tariff Board has already submitted to the Government a number of reports on the
          post-war prospects for secondary industries. A special planning commission is being set up
          to advise the Government on the basis of these reports, regarding the executive action
          needed to ensure that the productive capacity created by the expansion of war industries
          &#34;will be effectively converted to the service of the people of Australia.</para>
                <para>The work of all reconstruction agencies is being co-ordinated through the Ministry of
          Post-war Reconstruction which operates in consultation and collaboration with other
          Commonwealth bodies and, where necessary, with those of the States.</para>
                <para>Among the lessons that this war has brought home to all Australians is the urgent need
          to increase the population. For Australia&#39;s future defence and to safeguard its
          position as a Pacific power a much larger population is needed. A larger home market would
          benefit both our primary and secondary industries and encourage the development of those
          now types of production which go to make up a high standard of living. Our aim must, be to
          ensure social and economic conditions which will foster a vigorous growth from our own
          stock and, supplementing this domestic growth, will encourage an inflow of suitable
          migrants.</para>

                    <para class="block">This bill has a twofold purpose. First, it implements the
            recommendations contained in the tenth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission for
            the payment during the current financial year of special grants totalling
            &#163;2,470,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.
            Secondly, the bill provides for the repeal of the Tasmania Grant Act 1943. That act,
            which was assented to on the 29th June, 1943., authorized the payment of &#163;200,000
            by way of further financial assistance to Tasmania during the financial year 1 9412-43.
            The grants recommended by the commission for payment this year, and those paid last
            year, are -</para>
                    <para>In assessing these special grants, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has followed
            the same general principles as in past years. Briefly, the fundamental principle
            followed by the commission is that special grants are based on the principle of
            financial needs and therefore are determined by the degree of help considered necessary
            to enable a claimant State, by reasonable effort, to function at, a standard not
            appreciably below that of the non-claimant States. The commission&#39;s methods of
            assessing financial needs are based on comparisons of the financial position of the
            States, and involve the financial relations between the Commonwealth and1 the States.</para>
                    <para>The commission&#39;s methods of assessing special grants take into account the
            effects of Commonwealth war policy. As the finances of the non-claimant States have been
            in a very prosperous condition since 1.940-41, mainly because of the effect of
            Commonwealth war expenditure, the commission compares the financial position of the
            claimant States, not with the surplus budget standard derived from averaging the
            budgetary results of the non-claimant States, but with a balanced budget standard. I am
            in complete accord with the commission&#39;s principle that it would be inappropriate to
            regard a surplus budget standard, which arises mainly from the stimulus of war
            expenditure, as a reasonable Australian standard for the calculation of special grants.
            There is no justification for making to the claimant States special grants which will
            exceed their actual financial needs.</para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission bases its assessments on the budgetary results of
            the States in the second year prior to that in which the grants are paid. Therefore the
            assessments for 1943-44 are based on 1941-42, the latest year for which complete
            information was available. In recommending the payments to be made, however, the
            commission takes into account the present day needs of the claimant States. Thus the
            commission has recommended that portion of each of the assessed grants for 1943-4&#39;4
            bc deferred until next financial year. Whilst the figures of payments which I have
            mentioned exclude amounts of &#163;250,000, &#163;500,000 and &#163;65,000, payment of
            which to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania respectively has been deferred
            until next year, the figures of payments include &#34; amounts of &#163;670,000 and
            &#163;170,000, payment of which to South Australia and Western Australia respectively
            had been deferred from last year.</para>
                    <para>I shall now give a brief explanation of the commission&#39;s assessments for each
            State, with particular reference to the difference between the grants paid in 1942- 43
            and those recommended for 1943- 44. The principal feature of the commission&#39;s
            calculations this year was a decline, compared with 1940-41, in the average severity of
            taxation in the non claimant States in 1941-42, in relation to that in the claimant
            States.</para>
                    <para>In 1941-42 South Australia enjoyed a surplus of &#163;1,290,000 after receiving a
            special grant. This involved a considerable improvement in the budget position of the
            State relative to the balanced budget standard adopted by the commission, and die grant
            assessed for South Australia this year was &#163;4S0,000, or &#163;740,000 less than the
            grant calculated for last year. Including an amount of &#163;670,000 deferred from the
            last year, the amount payable to South Australia this year would ha\ e been
            &#163;1,150,000, but the commission considers that the State will not require the whole
            of this amount to meet its revenue needs this year. Accordingly, an amount of
            &#163;250,000 is being deferred until next year, leaving an amount of &#163;900,000 to
            be paid to South Australia this year.</para>
                    <para>In 1941-42 &#34;Western Australia just balanced its budget after receiving a special
            grant. Because of that State&#39;s increased severity of taxation relative to that of
            the non-claimant States, the grant assessed for &#34;Western Australia this year was
            &#163;1,180,000, or &#163;210,000 more than that assessed last year. After including an
            amount of &#163;170,000 deferred from last year, the amount payable to Western Australia
            would have been &#163;1,350,000. As the commission considers that a grant of
            &#163;850,000 will suffice to meet that, State&#39;s requirements this year, an amount
            of &#163;500,000 is being deferred until next year.</para>
                    <para>Tasmania just succeeded in balancing its budget in 1941-42 after receiving a special
            grant of &#163;520,000. The grant assessed this year was &#163;785,000, or &#163;210,000
            more than that assessed and paid last year. The increase is due mainly to a large
            favorable adjustment on account of relative severity of taxation in 1941-42. From the
            evidence available at present the commission considers that an amount of &#163;65,000
            may appropriately be deferred until next year, and recommends that a grant of
            &#163;720,000 be paid to Tasmania this year.</para>
                    <para>In past years, the Government has always accepted the recommendations of the
            Commonwealth Grants Commission, whose principles and methods of assessing special grants
            produce reasonable results, having regard to the needs of the claimant States and the
            health of the federation as a whole. I am satisfied that the grants recommended for
            payment to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania should be sufficient to meet
            their financial needs in the present financial year.</para>
                    <para>As I have already mentioned, this bill also provides for the repeal of the Tasmania
            Grant Act 1943. I shall now give honorable members a brief outline of the events which
            render this action necessary. In September of last year the Government of Tasmania
            advised the Commonwealth Government that it considered the special grant of
            &#163;575,000 provided for in the States Grants Act 1942 inadequate in view of the
            deterioration in the budgetary position of that State since the 30th June, 1942. The
            Tasmanian Government therefore requested an unconditional payment of &#163;200,000 by
            way of additional Commonwealth assistance. The Commonwealth Government referred this
            request to the Commonwealth Grants Commission which, in an interim report on the 25th
            January, 1943, deferred its recommendation until later in the financial year when
            Tasmania&#39;s current financial needs could be better assessed. In its final report
            dated the 16th April, 1943, the commission recommended that an advance payment of
            &#163;200,000 be made to Tasmania, such advance to be deducted from the special grant in
            1944-45 in order to preserve fully the relativity- in the commission&#39;s method of
            assessing special grants. On being informed of the commission&#39;s recommendations, the
            Tasmanian Government lodged an application with the Commonwealth Grants Commission under
            section 6 (1) of the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942 for an . increase
            of &#163;200,000 in the income tax compensation authorized by that act. At the same
            time, the Commonwealth Government was informed that this application was made without
            prejudice to the advance already recommended-, &#39;but that if the application for
            increased income tax compensation were successful, the advance payment of &#163;200,000
            would not be required. The commission&#39;s report on this further &#39;application,
            which was received on the 20th June and immediately tabled in Parliament, recommended
            that no increase of income tax compensation be paid to Tasmania in the financial year
            1942-43. The Commonwealth Government adopted the commission&#39;s recommendation and
            advised the Tasmanian Government on the 25th June that it was introducing the Tasmania
            Grant Bill 1943 in Parliament that day to give effect to the commission&#39;s
            recommendation for the payment of an advance of &#163;200,000. That bill became law in
            time to make, the payment of &#163;200,000 before the close of the financial year, but
            the Tasmanian Government declined to accept the payment, giving as its reason that
            acceptance would involve a corresponding reduction of the special grant which would be
            recommended in 1944-45.</para>
                    <para>
                        As I have said, the commission assesses special grants on the budgetary results of
            the States in the second year prior to that in which the grants are paid. Thus
            Tasmania&#39;s financial position in 1942-43, which caused the Tasmanian Government to
            make an application for further financial assistance in that year to the amount of
            &#163;200,000, will form the basis for the commission&#39;s calculation of a special
            grant for 1944-45. The drift in the State&#39;s finances in 1942-43 will therefore bc
            automatically reflected in the grant for 1944-45. Unless, therefore, the &#163;200,000
            which the commission recommended were treated
                        <inline font-style="italic">us</inline>
                        an
            advance to be deducted from the grant to be paid in 1944-45, Tasmania would receive
            &#163;200,000 more than the amount considered necessary to meet its financial needs.
            That is to say, unconditional payment of &#163;200,000 would have involved duplication
            of Commonwealth assistance to Tasmania in respect of 1942-43. As Tasmania declined to
            accept the payment of &#163;200,000 as an advance grant, it is necessary to cancel the
            authority for payment of that grant, and provision is therefore made in this bill for
            the repeal of the Tasmania. Grant Act 1943. I commend the bill to honorable members.

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to obtain a loan appropriation of
            &#163;200,000,000 for war purposes and also to authorize the raising of an equivalent
            amount of loan moneys to finance war expenditure. The subject of war finance and our
            anticipated expenditure for the present year has been covered very fully in the budget
            and, therefore, I do not propose to traverse that ground again at any length. &#34;War
            expenditure for 1943-44 is estimated to reach &#163;570,000,000. Of this amount it is
            anticipated that approximately &#163;167,000,000 will be met from revenue, leaving a
            balance of &#163;403,000,000 to be provided from loan. The balance of loan appropriation
            available at the 30th June, 1943, was &#163;183,000,000. This amount, together with the
            provision in this bill and the revenue appropriation, should enable us to carry on until
            May next. Before that date a further war loan appropriation will be sought from
            Parliament.</para>

                            <para>. - Following the excellent example of preceding speakers, I shall confine my
              remarks to those problems which appear to me to be outstanding, and with which this
              Parliament will have to deal in the not distant future. Concerning the war, I shall do
              no more than make the briefest and most general remarks. Ever since the great victory
              in Tunisia, the tide of war has flowed in our direction.</para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">The position in Europe to-day is one which we can regard with some
            degree of complacency. The one thing certain is that that great enemy which but a short
            time ago threatened to overwhelm us is now on the defensive. Germany&#39;s hopes of
            world conquest have been shattered, and although it is still powerful and capable of
            prolonging the struggle for some considerable time, the end cannot be doubted. Germany
            must, in the end, be defeated. How long it will be before that end is reached no man can
            say. But unless and until Germany has been defeated, the war in the Pacific will not
            begin in real earnest. A stern, long drawn out struggle stretches before us. Japan is
            powerful. Its resources on land and sea and in the air are practically unimpaired. It
            will fight stubbornly, fanatically for every yard of ground it now holds. I do not,
            however, doubt that in the end we shall conquer. When the end comes Ave shall be
            confronted with great problems. Some, indeed, will force themselves upon us before the
            end is reached. One of them is daily becoming more acute; I refer to the food problem.
            This is already giving us some concern, but before we can hope for victory over Japan we
            shall have to provide for the American and British forces, who, when the war in Europe
            is over, will help us to win the war in the Pacific. Now that we are assured by the high
            military authorities that we are no longer in clanger of invasion we can safely withdraw
            from 50,000 to 100,000 men, now in our military forces, for absorption in our primary
            industries and, perhaps, in some of our secondary industries or what may have been
            called nonessential industries which are sadly in need of man-power. The first great
            problem that will confront us when the war is over is the rehabilitation of the members
            of our fighting services, and the creation of avenues of employment for the hundreds of
            thousands of persons who are now working in our munitions factories. His Excellency has
            directed our attention to this vast and complex problem, and we arc assured that the
            Government has it constantly under review and is making plans to ensure that the change
            over from war to peace shall be made smoothly and effectively.</para>
                        <para>The first problem to which I wish particularly to direct the attention of honorable
            members relates to the population of this country. It may be considered under two heads,
            &#34; migration &#34; and &#34; the birth rate &#34;. In dealing with all post-war
            problems we must remember that we are signatories to the Atlantic Charter. The solution
            of any of the problems that confront us now or that will confront us hereafter must
            necessarily be adjusted to the terms of that charter, and to the treaty of peace which
            will be fast-rooted in its provisions. We may be quite sure that the post-war world will
            not permit a country with an almost stagnant, population of 7,000,000 to slam its doors
            upon the peoples of the overcrowded countries. We shall have to consider this problem in
            relation to our White Australia policy, with which it is intimately associated. Our
            choice lies between providing facilities for the admittance and absorption of migrants
            of a suitable character, and the throwing aside of all barriers so as to allow the
            nationals of the overcrowded East to come into this country.</para>
                        <para>Migration is one of the problems which will have to be faced,, but migration of
            itself is not enough. We are confronted with a powerful and resolute enemy. We must not
            for a moment hug to our breasts the illusion that Japan will fall like a ripe plum into
            our mouths if or when Germany is beaten, or collapse because the morale of its people
            cracks. The fight against Japan will be long and stern, and we dare contemplate nothing
            short of complete and final victory. We can see our enemy, we feel his blows, and we can
            take such measures as are open to us, with the assistance of our Allies, to meet and
            defeat him; but there is another enemy, unseen, and perhaps even more deadly than Japan.
            It is not hyperbole to say that Australia is bleeding to death. The figures show very
            vividly that this is no exaggeration of the position in which we find ourselves.
            European settlement in Australia is now a little more than 150 years old. For a long
            time our progress was painfully slow, but later, as a result of the discovery of gold,
            the country leapt ahead There have been periods of depression during which the growth of
            the community lagged, but over a period of fifty years and more it made great progress.
            I propose to take a comparatively recent period in order to illustrate the point I wish
            to make. At the beginning of the 25 years period from 1909 to 1933, the birth-rate, by
            which I mean the gross reproduction rate, was 1.781. This highly satisfactory rate of
            increase was due to natural fertility and migration which reached its peak in
            1910-19113, when it began to fall and, except for a brief recovery during the post-war
            years, it went on falling until, in 1933, the figure stood at 1.052, a decline of 41 per
            cent. In 21 years the rate declined from a figure characteristic of a rapidly increasing
            population to one which was too low to maintain even a stationary population. In 1932,
            the rate was 1.03, a figure at which fertility and mortality were in equilibrium; and it
            still oscillates around that point. However, those figures do not set out the position
            fairly, because not only is the population stagnant, but its composition has changed.
            There are now proportionately more old people and fewer young people. At the beginning
            of the period under review children under ten years numbered 118.1 per 1000 of the
            population, while in 1933 the figure bad declined to .SI pei 1000. This illustrates very
            vividly the effect of a declining birth-rate. The decline has continued despite efforts
            from time to time to encourage a higher birthrate or, at all events, to check a further
            decline. Laws applicable throughout the Commonwealth have been passed - family
            endowment, a means of encouraging large families which naturally suggests itself, may be
            cited as typical of this class of legislation. Notwithstanding the adoption of these
            measures, however, the decline of the birth-rate has not been materially checked. Every
            effort made by such countries as Germany and Italy to increase the birth-rate by
            providing marriage loans, and by making special provision for the purchase of furniture,
            &#38;c., in order to encourage family life, has failed. We must face the fact that,
            basically, the problem of the declining birth-rate is not economic. The economic factor
            is at best subsidiary, as is proved by the fact that the fall in the birth-rate is
            greater in the well-to-do districts than in the working-class suburbs of our great
            cities.</para>
                        <para>The basic causes of the fall of the birth-rate are psychological; they are moral, if
            you like to put it so, and the remedy is to be sought in a reorientation of outlook,
            ideals, and the concept of life. We are now engaged in a life and death struggle. We are
            fighting not only for liberty, but for survival. We are fighting that we and our
            children after us may, as a free people, hold Australia. We are not fighting that alien
            people may take the land for which our men are now dying. To ensure that we shall
            preserve this country for ourselves we must populate Australia with Australian people.
            Amongst the remedies for the falling birth-rate the provision of suitable homes for the
            people is of first importance. Housing on a grand scale is a problem to which this
            Government should immediately give its earnest attention. Some of the States are
            preparing plans for the erection of suitable houses on a liberal scale, but the problem
            of population is national, and this Government, which has received a mandate from the
            people to carry on this war and to bring about measures of&#39; social security
            compatible with our concept of the new order can direct its attention to no problem with
            greater benefit to the people than that of providing suitable homes for the people.
            Quite apart from the fall of the birth-rate there is a vital need for homes for the
            people who are away now fighting for Australia, or who are tirelessly engaged in
            carrying on war work. We owe to the men and women who are now fighting and working for
            victory that when the war is over they shall be suitably housed. I do not merely mean
            places where men and women can sleep and eat, but homes where the cult of family life is
            possible. It is only on the basis of family that any enduring civilization can be
            reared. The civilizations of ancient Rome and Greece withered and decayed, not because
            they were overwhelmed by enemies, but because the crop of men had failed. But, in any
            case, homes for the people are essential, because homes are the environment in which
            character is moulded. The nation depends on the character of its people, upon their
            physique, and upon the ideals they cherish, and it is in the home that the character of
            our men and women is moulded. So homes for the people are essential, not only as a means
            of bringing about that change of outlook of men and women &#34;which is essential if we
            are to encourage a higher fertility, but also because of its reaction upon the
            psychology of the people. Home life profoundly affects the outlook of married people. A
            home suggests in its very nature that it is a nest. The need for children is obvious. A
            home is not a home in the true sense of the word without children. I put it to this
            House, and to the country, that suitable homes for the people must be provided. Slums
            must be demolished. I read somewhere the other day that there were no slums in the
            Australian cities, but that is not&#39; so, for, unfortunately, some of our cities,
            Sydney and Melbourne in particular, have slums that are a disgrace to the Australian
            people. I cannot speak with such intimate knowledge of some of our other capital cities
            as I can of Sydney and Melbourne, but I say emphatically that some of the slums in both
            those cities are a disgrace to our people. We - are not, as are people in many
            countries, hampered by lack of space; we are citizens of a great wide land in which
            there is ample room for suitably housing a far greater population than we now have. The
            materials are ready to our hand - I do not deny that for the moment we lack manpower -
            and it needs only organization for us to have roomy and convenient houses, with gardens
            as places where children can be reared - homes, not flats, over the portals of which may
            well be inscribed &#34; No children admitted &#34;. I, therefore, lay very great
            emphasis upon the need for effective measures to deal with the problem at the very
            earliest possible moment.</para>
                        <para>As to migration, if we want suitable migrants we must create conditions that will
            attract them. People talk lightheartedly about bringing tens of thousands of migrants
            into this country immediately. It was my privilege to be a member of the Government
            during the period when the greatest number of migrants that has ever entered this
            country came here. They entered the Commonwealth at the rate of between 24,000 and
            30,000 a year, and never in our his-, tory has that number been exceeded, except during
            the gold rush in the early fifties. We shall have to consider the economy of this
            country, and its capacity to employ large numbers of immigrants. To induce them to
            settle here, we must create conditions not only to attract the kind we want, but also to
            absorb them; and this of course is possible only by the expansion of primary and
            secondary industries.</para>
                        <para>
                            I now desire to make some observations upon world peace, and the Atlantic Charter
            upon which that peace will be founded. Without peace in the world, talk of social
            security is idle. The Atlantic Charter postulates that there shall be freedom from want,
            freedom from fear, and liberty of speech and of religious beliefs. When victory has been
            won, these freedoms are to be the common heritage of all men. We are to have all four;
            no country has ever enjoyed them before. Australia, perhaps, has approached nearer to
            the goal than any other nation. For the greater part of its existence, Australia has had
            freedom from fear, and fear of want has been less here than in most other countries.
            Freedom of speech and of religious belief has been woven into the pattern of our lives.
            But we are among the most fortunate of nations. Freedom from fear of war is impossible
            without the creation of an organization that will ensure world peace. Plans for world
            peace are not new. At intervals during the last six centuries schemes for ensuring world
            peace have been submitted for the consideration of the rulers of nations and, in some
            instances, they have been adopted. But all of them have failed. World peace is not to be
            obtained, as some people imagine, without paying the price. Freedom from fear and
            freedom from want cannot be obtained by communities which imagine that the new order
            means a condition in which they shall hold out both hands to receive, while giving
            nothing in return. Heavy and obvious responsibilities devolve upon the citizens of every
            country that is a signatory to the Atlantic Charter, because it levels, in one
            comprehensive sweep, all those barriers of distance, race, varying sta ml a rel s of
            living anil forms of government by which nations have been divided, and beckons mankind
            under a bond of common citizenship to join this new order. Freedom from want, freedom
            from fear, and freedom of speech and religious belief - these things are easily said ;
            but in order that we may have world peace, without which none of these things i3
            possible, there must be an organization to ensure it. Of course, the radical cure for
            Avar is a change of heart. That is also a cure for all our domestic ills. There would be
            no want, trouble or poverty in society if we were to pattern our conduct on the basic
            truths of the Christian religion. But man, while mou tiling his faith, has not patterned
            his conduct on those principles. I find in the Atlantic Charter a terrifying resemblance
            to the Covenant of the League of Nation.?. More than a quarter of a century has passed
            since that covenant was first formulated. It contained nothing new.
                            <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#39;&#93;</inline>
                            It was a
            restatement of principles that had been put forward by the Holy Alliance, the Quadruple
            Alliance and St, Augustine long, long ago. But, all the world believed what President
            Wilson said. His fourteen points, upon which the covenant was founded, had captured the
            imagination of men in every land. The world hung upon his lightest word, and thronged in
            vast multitudes to hear him. Even Caesar was never received as President Wilson was in
            Rome. People &#39;believed that a new order had come, in which men would live together
            in peace and happiness all the days of their lives. War w,a&#171; to be for ever
            banished, and peace resting on the basic principle of social justice, was to endure for
            ever. The League failed, though not because of any defect in the organization. The
            instrument itself provided for the settlement of disputes- by arbitration, and that was
            not a new idea. It is true that some of the disputes were not justifiable. Such disputes
            brought the present war to the world. But there was to be at the back of the League of
            Nations, adequate armed force. President Wilson was emphatic about that. The League
            failed, not because of any defects in the instrument that created it, but be cause, the
            nations that composed it would not honour their obligations. They desired peace, but
            would not pay the price of peace. If the Atlantic Charter is to banish war, it must
            impair our sovereignty. It will take from us the right to determine our own destiny. We
            shall have to adjust our economy and our mode of life to fit into the new order. Of
            course, we do not know to what degree the peace treaty will give effect to the
            generalizations embodied in the Four Freedoms. Et will be impossible to ensure peace in
            the world unless the peace-loving nations are willing to abandon so much of their
            sovereign powers as will permit disputes among them to be settled by peaceful means. In
            short, the charter proposals aim at establishing the rule of law throughout the world.
            But the rule of law is dependent upon adequate force. Without adequate force even
            domestic peace is impossible. Consequently, the Atlantic Charter visualizes an armed
            force which a central authority may direct and control. It will be the duty of the
            signatories to the charter - and Australia is a signatory - to maintain such armed
            forces as the central authority, however constituted, may direct. In the very nature of
            things, there will need to be searching inspections from time to time to prevent lawless
            nations from disturbing the peace of the world.
                        </para>
                        <para>But the effect of the Atlantic Charter will not stop there. The charter will have a
            far-reaching influence upon our economy. We have been told that under the new order
            there must be no unemployment. Everybody must have a job and most people are to be
            provided with pensions when their working days are done. In short, largess is to be
            distributed with a prodigal hand. But it must be realized that schemes of social
            security can be provided only from the wealth of the community. This is a question, not
            merely of money, but of goods and services. I have on many occasions made my attitude
            towards money perfectly clear. Money must be the hand-maiden of industry ; it must aid,
            and not hamper, production. The goods and services available for all the needs of the
            community, including, of course, social services and pensions of all kinds, depend upon
            the wealth produced by the community. That applies to every section of the community. In
            the happy days that are now receding farther and farther from us, it was the habit of
            governments to tax the&#39; rich in order to provide funds for their schemes of social
            security, hut this source of revenue has now been reduced to a mere trickle. From what
            the Treasurer has told us this afternoon, a rich man will soon bc rarer than a white
            crow. Therefore the cost of social services will have to be provided by the workers. If
            freedom from want were to be applicable only to Australia it would be a simple matter,
            for Australia produces an abundance of food and raw materials which provide not only
            sufficient for its present population but also substantial quantities for export. But as
            freedom from want is to apply not only to Australia but also to every other part of the
            world its achieve-&#39; ment will impose upon us, and upon every other country similarly
            situated, the duty and responsibility of contributing towards supplying the needs of the
            people of other nations. We are told that to-day 17,000,000 people in Bengal are on the
            verge of starvation. Hundreds of millions of people in other parts of the world have a
            standard of living far below our own - a standard which we call a bare subsistence
            level. It is our duty, therefore, and it will be to our advantage, to do everything .in
            our power to improve the standard of living of these people. This is a responsibility
            which we cannot escape, but it is also an opportunity we ought not to ignore. We are
            advantageously situated, geographically, to provide many of the things which the people
            of the overcrowded East will desire if their standard of living be raised.</para>
                        <para>The new order concerning which we hear so much is not new, for when I first entered
            public life I was one of its banner-bearers. If any man had suggested to me in those
            days that the new order was not just round the corner I should probably have brained
            him. When T look back and contrast the conditions of those days with those which existed
            just before the war, I realize that we &#34;have come far along the road; but many a
            Mount Pisgah still has to be climbed before mankind reaches its goal. Some people seem
            to visualize the new order as a Utopia in which men will go to their work decked with
            garlands and singing joyous songs, and in which the hours will be few, and the task
            light. But as I see it, the future holds other things in store. For us, there can be no
            new and better order without hard and more efficient work. This applies to
            industrialists as well as to their employees. All inefficient methods in both primary
            and secondary industries must be scrapped. The policy of economic nationalism under
            which we and other nations have lived and tinder which our industries have been built up
            is doomed. The objective of that policy was to make a. nation self-contained - to sell
            everything and buy nothing. Speaking in the 1932 Assembly of the League of Nations, I
            referred to this policy in terms which honorable members will agree have special
            application to our present circumstances. I said -</para>

            particularly secondary industries, have been developed under high tariff walls, which

            prosperity. We are, I hope, resolved to press forward. I would not have you believe for
            a moment that all these schemes to ensure world peace, all these short-cuts to Utopia,
            have failed completely, more than have the efforts of any one of us to achieve our own
            particular ends. At any rate, we have made the effort. We must go on. If we fail to
            reach the goal to-morrow, we may reach it on the following day. World peace is essential
            and we must pay the price demanded by it. As a part of that price, we must assume
            greater responsibilities and must pay in labour and efficiency. The industries of this

                                <para>- I am sure the honorable gentleman will agree that under the Atlantic Charter
                the world will not permit high tariffs. Maybe the nations will not agree to the
                charter. If they do not, there can be no world peace. We have shown ourselves to be
                a resourceful, an energetic, and an adaptable people, and we are as well fitted as
                any people in the world to hold our own in the new order, provided we adopt
                up-to-date methods. We are called upon to abandon the narrow, parochial outlook, the
                policy of isolation. We ought to enter the new order as banner bearers, not be
                dragged into it reluctantly as though we were a backward people. We have led the
                world in many social and economic reforms. In peace and in war, we have held our
                own. We must be citizens of the world, but we must not be less citizens of
                Australia. Love of country is not incompatible with that internationalism of which I
                speak. What is the secret of Russia&#39;s magnificent resistance, of its sacrifices,
                of its successes ? The Russians have an abiding faith in, and love for, their
                fatherland. There are some people who say that the great victories won by the
                Russian people are due ro their political creed. But that is not so. The Russians
                believe in Russia and have always been ready to fight and die in its defence under
                any form of government. They proved that long ago, for after all what has happened
                to Germany happened to Napoleon. The deathless courage of the Russian people and
                their scorched earth policy overwhelmed Napoleon as it has Hitler. The Russians have
                demonstrated that love of country is not incompatible with that policy of
                internationalism which Lenin preached, but in which, perhaps, Stalin does not
                believe. We too must cultivate a love of mir fatherland, Australia. There is no such
                love now. But we must not stop here. We are here to-day after over four years of war
                safe and free, not only through our own valour and sacrifices, but also because we
                are partners in the great Commonwealth of British Nations. Whatever happens to the
                new League of Nations, this league of free nations, the British Empire, will not
                fail. It has not failed in the two greatest wars in history. It has not failed in
                the past, it will not fail in the future. The best citizen is the man who is the
                best husband and father. Love of home and family is not incompatible with good
                citizenship; and love of Australia, and belief in the Empire, are not incompatible
                with citizenship of the world. We have great opportunities as well as great
                responsibilities. We must prove ourselves worthy of them.</para>

                            <para>.- Although it was intended by the Opposition that I should not be returned as the
              member for Hume, the electors of that division decided otherwise, and returned me with
              an overwhelming majority after a lapse of twelve and a half years in their
              representation by a Labour man. I attribute my return as a Labour representative to
              several factors. First, honorable members who to-day occupy the Opposition benches
              failed to measure up to standard in the conduct of the affairs of this nation in the
              days of peace as well as in the hour of crisis. After the last world war, which was to
              be a. war to make the world safe for democracy, the seeds of another conflict were
              allowed to germinate. After the war of 1914-18 there was a boom for a few years; then
              followed the period of &#34; bust &#34;, with the result that hundreds of thousands of
              men and women were denied the right to live. They tramped the roads in a vain search
              for work, and at night they slept under the bridges. In time of peace the present
              Opposition, which was then in power, demonstrated that it was unable to cope with the
              situation. Then, in - this national crisis which has overtaken us, it again
              demonstrated that it was not to be trusted with the government of the country. When
              Australia was threatened, the non-Labour parties failed dismally, and the affairs of
              the nation were handed over to the man who I believe is the greatest statesman this
              country has ever produced, the Right Honorable John Curtin. At the recent election the
              people expressed their confidence in him by returning the Labour party with an
              overwhelming majority. The people have spoken, declaring in no uncertain way that the
              Opposition has not, in their opinion, the capacity to govern. The Labour party has
              always risen to the occasion, and I am convinced that the best thing that could happen
              to Australia was the return of a Labour majority. With Labour in power we shall march
              forward to a better and brighter future.</para>

                        <para>However, a national parliament which lacks control of finance and land is not an
            effective instrument of government. I submit that the Commonwealth Parliament should
            assume supreme control of land and all other national resources, including money.
            Founded on the nation&#39;s wealth and national resources, the Commonwealth Bank is the
            key to national progress. It follows that the national wealth becomes the bank&#39;s
            capital asset. The creation of national credit should be its sole prerogative, and this
            authority should be held inviolate. The manipulation of credit by private banking
            corporations and financial institutions must i-.e prevented. Founded on the wealth and
            national resources of Australia, and supported by the careful husbandry of its citizens,
            the nation&#39;s bank will never close its doors while the rain falls and the sun
            shines. Unlimited finance can be made available without the creation of an intolerable
            debt structure. If the affairs of the bank be wisely and economically administered, it
            must go on all the time increasing its capital assets.</para>
                        <para>
                            At the present time we have all the finance necessary. Our industries are supplying
            all the essential requirements of the nation. The&#39; highly organized and
            well-equipped Civil Constructional Corps could be switched practically overnight from
            war-time to peace-time activities. It is only necessary to provide a concrete plan to
            enable this organization to go full steam ahead after the war, so that people may enjoy
            real freedom, owing fealty to none for the first time in the history of this country.
            To-day, the tide of opportunity is at the flood. We must either. ride on its crest or be
            submerged by it. I appeal to this Parliament to make a beginning now ; delay will be
            fatal. Any loss of time in changing over from wartime to peace-time activities would
            assuredly result in dislocation and chaos, whilst unemployment would become an almost
            insoluble problem. By a decree of the Commonwealth, all land, whether alienated or not,
            should be taken out of the control of the States and placed under the control of the
            National Parliament te be held in trust for the people on

                            title only - perpetual lease. Already thousands of acres have been
            resumed for defence purposes. Why should not all the land be resumed in the interests of
            national security? The day of large holdings has definitely passed. Unless we ourselves
            are prepared to subdivide the large holdings and decentralize our population, some
            foreign power will assuredly do those things for us. When resuming large holdings, the
            Government should exempt those used for the breeding of stud stock. Rather than enforce
            disintegration by extra taxation, the Government should reduce taxes on those properties
            in order to encourage greater effort. Pure stock is vitally essential.
                        </para>
                        <para>I come now to another important problem facing this country, that is the greater use
            of water, the great giver of life. It is of paramount importance that Australia shall be
            ribboned with waterways, even to its dead heart, by diverting the water that now flows
            down our great rivers to the sea. Should there exist in Central Australia a large enough
            depression below sea level, then, I say, turn the ocean, the mother of rain, into it and
            create new life there.</para>
                        <para>I have heard honorable members talk about the need to increase our population. I
            have lived in a country area all my life. I remember that about twenty years ago when
            one went into an agricultural centre one saw dozens of horses lined up waiting to be
            shod. One saw teamsters on the road. One heard horses hooves beating along the highway.
            But to-day all those things have gone. We are living in a new age and a new world.
            Things have changed. The country centres have lost all their horses and replaced them
            with machines. With the horses many other things have gone, and the country areas arc
            worse off as the result. Before the war there was a constant drift of young men and
            women from the rural districts to the cities. With the advent of war, the country areas
            have been stripped bare of men. As a business man, I know how hard it is for the country
            to struggle on when deprived of those who have provided us with our bread and butter
            over the years. &#39;Centralization of our industries in the great cities of the
            Commonwealth is the curse of the Commonwealth. That brings me to the reference in the
            Governor-General&#39;s Speech to marauding raids. We must realize what a fatal effect a
            marauding raid would have on our secondary industries, concentrated as they are in the
            metropolitan areas. That is a condition which must be changed through the application of
            a vigorous policy of decentralization. We must ensure that secondary industry shall be
            spread through the Commonwealth, not confined to a couple of big cities. It must be our
            policy to place in country towns such industries as clothing factories, knitting mills
            and abattoirs - all the industries that can be developed away from the seaboard. We
            shall not be able properly to populate this country until we direct our attention to
            decentralization of industry and until we break up the large estates through the
            existence of which our country towns are landlocked and cannot be expanded. In a part of
            my electorate on Saturday lust I was talking to a former grazier, a mam who has lived
            all his life on the land, and he told me that in- the town of Harden there were men each
            holding 40,000 acres adjacent to the town. He also said that no man in that area ought
            to be on the land if he could not make a decent living out of 1,000 acres, which, he
            claimed, would return, at the very lowest, &#163;1,000 a year. Why should a few people
            hold this country so tightly as to stop its progress? This country&#39;s advance has
            been retarded for many, many years as the result of the policy that has been applied.
            If, at the outset, we had applied the policy which I am now advocating, instead of
            having only 7,000,000 people, Australia to-day would have 70,000,000 people.</para>
                        <para class="block">These large estates must be broken up so that our towns shall no
            longer be landlocked. In the Hume electorate there is not one town that is not
            landlocked, although it is perhaps the most fertile electorate in Australia. There is
            hardly anything that cannot be produced in Hume. We have beef, wool, dairying, maize,
            millet, fruit and tobacco and great resources of timber. From the agricultural point of
            view it is considered to be one of the best and safest electorates in Australia. I hope
            that while I am member for Hume I shall be instrumental in bringing about great progress
            in that electorate. Until the Curtin Ministry took office not one war industry of any
            kind had been set up in it, because the parties then in office knew that the
            establishment of war industries there would result in an influx of people who would vote
            their representative out of Parliament. They took a sectional view instead of a national
            view, but, while I remain in this chamber, I shall deal with all problems, not
            sectionally, but from a national point of view.</para>
                        <para>In the post-war reconstruction period I shall want to see an extension of
            electricity mains to rural areas. The farmers throughout this country should have all
            the facilities that we can give them. They should be able to turn on the electric light
            with as much ease as we can in this city of Canberra or in many country towns. We should
            be able to give the farmers power to operate milking machines, bath heaters, and stoves.
            When this war ends there will be plenty of skilled tradesmen to do the work that will be
            necessary to improve the amenities of the farming community, and it will be the duty of
            this Government and of the people of Australia to ensure that their services shall be
            used for that purpose. There are many other directions in which the lot of the country
            dweller must, be improved. In particular, I refer to roads. During the electoral
            campaign, I covered my vast electorate three times and found that as the result of a
            diversion to war of labour from the various shires in the electorate the roads have got
            into a deplorable state of disrepair. When the war ends, there should be plenty of work
            for the demobilized servicemen and the surplus munitions makers in rebuilding country
            roads so that they will compare in quality with those which exist in this city. I.
            subscribe to the policy that brought about the construction of the excellent roads in
            the Australian Capital Territory, and I earnestly hope that similar roads will be built
            for the purpose of enabling primary producers to transport their produce from farm to
            railway. In addition, I advocate the construction of a road linking Canberra with the
            Hume Highway near Albury. This route, which was surveyed some years ago, obviates the
            necessity for travelling via Yass, and reduces the distance to Albury by 40 or 50 miles.
            As the road would be of strategic value, I hope that the Government will undertake the
            work.</para>
                        <para>At the recent general elections, the people of Australia expressed their unshakable
            confidence in the capacity of the Labour party to prosecute the war to a successful
            conclusion, and to solve the problems of post-war reconstruction. I am sure that the
            Government, at the expiration of its term of office, will receive another overwhelming
            vote of confidence. After the war the problem of re-employing men and women of the
            services will be tackled boldly, and I express the view that no soldier should be
            discharged from the Army until a position has been found for him. Every Australian able
            and willing to work should have a job. That is his birthright in this wonderful country.</para>

              emphasized the necessity for a realistic approach to the problems of peace. I have
              every respect for the right honorable gentleman, although I do not always agree with
              his deductions. If we are to derive the benefits of a new order, we must not approach
              the matter from the standpoint of self-interest, or be swayed by passions. Some people
              already believe that the principal preliminary to peace, namely, the winning of the
              war, has already been achieved, and all we have to do is to wait for the cheers that
              will celebrate victory. Being a realist. I am not impressed with that view. The
              statement of the great Russian ambassador, Litvinoff, before the outbreak of war that
              &#34; peace is one and indivisible &#34;, should be considered deeply by honorable
              members. The corollary is that a military victory will not bring permanent peace,
              because there can be no great military victory without a correspondingly great defeat
              for the opposition. The history of the world provides no instance of final peace
              having resulted from great victories. In our own generation we have witnessed the
              consequences of the great military victory of the last war. For four years the world
              was deluged with blood, and great cities and the fair countryside were laid waste. In
              the post-war era occurred a world-wide depression, causing a breakdown of human
              morale, disillusionment and want of faith. All those evils follow in the wake of war.
              They are the aftermath of victory, and we must not overlook them when we are
              considering the new order. I well remember President &#34;Wilson&#39;s Fourteen
              Points. They were very similar to the Four Freedoms contained in the Atlantic Charter.
              After the last war we spoke of the &#34; self determination of nations &#34;, and the
              c: right of all countries to a place in the sun &#34;. Men acted, before and during
              the last war, precisely as they acted before and during this war. Therefore, it is
              logical to infer that they will do after this war the same things as they did after
              the last war if it concludes with a military victory for the United Nations. We should
              examine the statements that have been made by our statesmen, disregarding for the time
              being the utterances that have emanated from the spokesmen of our enemies, for the
              purpose of obtaining a plain statement of fact that will not confuse the man in the
              street. After all, the average citizen will have to pay for this war in blood and
              treasure. T am impressed by a statement published in the

                            <para>We are constantly being told that we are fighting this war for freedom and for
              liberty. It would be a sorry thing for Englishmen to find that they had conquered the

              interference and bureaucratic control at home.</para>
                            <para>It is the fashion to suggest that the State should plan and make itself

              wholly false one. State planning leads inevitably to certain evils against which we in
              this country have fought hard for many hundreds of years. It leads to the evils of
              tyranny, bureaucracy and monopoly. Another great danger is that State planning causes
              great uncertainty, and uncertainty is more damaging to trade and commerce than
              anything else.</para>

            England. I could quote other similar excerpts from pamphlets and journals on current
            affairs which have been published in Great Britain, but I shall refer now to a
            declaration that has been made on behalf of the United Nations which are &#171;n joying
            the benefit of the lend-lease legislation of the United States of America. The
            governments signatory thereto declare -</para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>Each government pledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic,

                        <para>Does not that policy imply adherence to the old order of the balance of power in
            Europe? The United Kingdom Government is a signatory to that declaration for a reason.
            Probably, it fears that a military victory by any one nation might be manoeuvred in such
            a way as to monopolize political power in continental Europe and menace the balance of
            power. The principal representative of Imperial England has declared, in effect, that he
            will not preside at the dissolution of the British Empire; yet the spokesman of the
            United States of America indicates that America is hoping to see a new world order
            emerge from the terrible and disastrous cauldron of war.</para>
                        <para>The issues are so confusing to a plain man like myself that I consider the time to
            be ripe for spokesmen of the opposing factions, to use a colloquial expression, to &#34;
            come clean &#34; and tell the people their real motives. The world has been at war for
            more than four years. Thousands of lives have already been lost and if the war continues
            much longer, millions will be lost. Europe has already been devastated from end to end,
            for the juggernaut has rolled over its finest countries. The war has reached down into
            the Pacific and threatens to bring destruction to many other parts of the globe.
            Apparently the time has now come when the active participants would like temporarily to
            withdraw behind their battlements to recover from their exhaustion, to gain a little
            breathing space, and to gird up their loins for a fresh attack. In these circumstances,
            has not the time arrived for reasonable people to intervene? I realize that sometimes
            when people intervene in a dispute they become embroiled in it, but at other times they
            are able to bring about a cessation of hostilities. In the circumstances in which we
            find ourselves, the benefits likely to be gained from the intervention of
            representatives of the common people are far greater than the risks likely to be taken
            by a continuance of the war. I therefore urge that steps be taken to ascertain, in some
            reliable manner, the views of the common people.</para>
                        <para>This is all the more necessary because we have now reached a state of affairs when
            the mobilized man-power of the world has become strained to such a point that the famine
            conditions which prevail in India may be experienced in other countries. Every nation is
            to-day reaching out towards food production targets, but the tasks that are being faced
            appear to be impossible of achievement unless man-power can be diverted to food
            production. Those who control the war machines of the various countries tell us that
            man-power cannot be released from the services and that all the men available are
            necessary to carry on the war. If such a state of affairs continues for much longer a
            military victory for either side will mean nothing, because the world will have been
            brought to a state of starvation. Unless we are careful there will be a dissolution of
            the present order, such as occurred in the days of the Roman Empire, and we shall revert
            to the conditions of the dark ages from which we may not emerge for many decades. A
            realistic approach to present day conditions is to look not for a new world order but for
            a means by which the war may be stopped as soon as possible.</para>

                            <para>It would be strange indeed were I not to-night deeply conscious of the fact, if
              not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of
              responsibility; because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed
              this House. For that reason, it is an occasion which, for every woman in the
              Commonwealth, marks in some degree a turning point in history. I am well aware that,
              as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so
              shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to
              follow me in public service in the years to come. I know that many honorable members
              have viewed the advent of women to the legislative halls with something approaching
              alarm; they have feared, I have no doubt, the somewhat too vigorous use of a new
              broom. I wish to reassure them. I hold very sound views on brooms, and sweeping.
              Although I quite realize that a new broom is a very useful adjunct to the work of the
              housewife, I also know that it undoubtedly is very unpopular in the broom cupboard; and
              this particular new broom knows that she has a very great deal to learn from the
              occupants of - I dare not say this particular cupboard. At all events, she hopes to
              conduct herself with sufficient modesty and sufficient sense of her lack of knowledge
              at least to earn the desire of honorable members to give her whatever help they may be
              able to give. I believe, very sincerely, that any woman entering the public arena must
              be prepared to work as men work; she must justify herself not as a woman, but as a
              citizen; she must attack the same problems, and be prepared to shoulder the same
              burdens. But because I am a woman, and cannot divest myself of those qualities that
              are inherent in my sex, and because every one of us speaks broadly in the terms of
              one&#39;s own experience, honorable members will have to become accustomed to the
              application of the homely metaphors of the kitchen rather than those of the operating
              theatre, the workshop, or the farm. They must also become accustomed to the
              application to all kinds of measures of the touchstone of their effect upon the home
              and the family life. I hope that no one will imagine that that implies in any way a
              limitation of my political interests. Rather, it implies an everwidening outlook on
              every problem that faces the world to-day. Every subject, from high finance to
              international relations, from social security to the winning of the war, touches very
              closely the home and the family. The late King George V, as he neared the end of a
              great reign and a good life, made a statement upon which any one may base the whole of
              one&#39;s political philosophy, when he said, &#34; The foundation of a nation&#39;s
              greatness is in the homes of its people &#34;. Therefore, honorable members will not,
              I know, be surprised when I say that I am likely to be even more concerned with
              national character than with national effort.</para>
                            <para>Somewhere about the year 1830 there began a period in Australian history which for
            me has always held a peculiar fascination. I should like to have been born at about that
            time. I should like to have been alive in the days when bushrangers flourished, when
            life was hard and even raw, when gold was discovered, when the colonies became States,
            and when all of the great social and political movements were born which so coloured the
            fabric of Australian life; because, during all those years very much of what we now know
            as the Australian character was formed. It was during those years that we learned those
            things which still characterize the great bulk of our people - hatred of oppression,
            love of &#34; a fair go &#34;, a passion for justice. It was in those years that we
            developed those qualities of initiative and daring that have marked our men in every war
            in which they have fought - qualities which, I hope, will never be allowed to die. We
            are now on the threshold of such another era, when further formative measures will have
            to be taken; because we are to-day an organized community which no longer exists purely
            upon the initiative of its individual members, and if we would serve Australia well we
            must preserve those characteristics that were formed during that early period of our
            history.</para>
                            <para>I have been delighted, since I came here, to find the almost unanimity that exists
            in respect of the need for social service and in respect of many of the other problems
            that have been discussed in this chamber. In the matter of social security one thing
            stands out clearly in my mind. Such things are necessary in order that the weak shall
            not go to the wall, that the strong may be supported, that all may have justice. But we
            must never so blanket ourselves that those fine national qualities of which I have
            spoken shall no longer have play. I know so well that fear, want and idleness can kill
            the spirit of any people. But I know, too, that security can be bought at too great a
            cost - the cost of spiritual freedom. How, then, may we strike a balance? That, it seems
            to me, is the big question for us to decide to-day. There is one answer. We know
            perfectly well that any system of social security devised to-day must be financed
            largely from general taxation. Yet I would insist that every person in the community in
            receipt of any income whatsoever must make some contribution to the fund for social
            security. I want it to be an act of conscious citizenship. I want every child to be
            taught that when he begins to earn, then, for the first time, he will have the first
            privilege and right of citizenship - to begin to contribute to the great scheme that has
            been designed to serve him when he is no longer able to work and to help all of those
            who at any period of their lives may meet with distress or trouble. In such a scheme, I
            believe, there should be pensions for all; there should be no means test; those who have
            should contribute according to their means. But every one, however little he or she
            earns, should contribute something, be it only a three-penny stamp, as a sort of token
            payment for the advantage of Australian citizenship. In passing, let me say this: There
            is one reform, at least, that could be applied to our present pensions system, which
            would have the greatest effect in making a little brighter the lives of those upon whom
            the years are already closing in. I consider that every pensioner should have his or her
            pension posted to him or her in the form of a cheque. At the present time any pensioner
            who so wishes has the right to have the pension sent in that way, but few pensioners are
            aware of it. If that were done, I believe that not only would congestion in post offices
            be relieved, but also that a small contribution would be made to easing the burden of
            those who have come to old age or illness.</para>
                            <para>I am delighted that the honorable member for Denison Dr. Gaha
            should have secured the honour of having introduced to this chamber, in
            this debate, the subject of population. Other members also have seized upon that
            subject, apparently with a very great deal of pleasure, and have dealt with it at some
            length; but to the honorable member for Denison go the honours. I, like him, have
            pondered on this subject - not with my feet upon the mantle-piece, but knee-deep in
            shawls and feeding bottles. I have pondered it, surrounded by those who, by their very
            numbers, have done quite a good deal to boost the population of Australia. I
            believe that I have at least tried out some of the theories which would make for a
            better population, and that I know some of the difficulties that present themselves to
            any person who, in these days, desires to rear a family. One honorable member has spoken
            of the need for a greater population for reasons of defence. That, of course, is
            something that has to be considered. But there has also to be considered the fact that,
            unless we fill this country we shall have no justification in the years that are ahead
            for holding it at all.</para>
                            <para>Another honorable member spoke of the need for decentralization. On the north-west
            coast of Tasmania, which is a part of the district that I represent, there is, I
            believe, the best example of decentralization that is to be found anywhere in Australia;
            but I do not want the House to believe that that is why eleven members of the Lyons
            family were born at Devonport. I consider that something more than decentralization is
            necessary if the population of Australia is to be increased. It would be well to go
            back a little while and look for the reasons for the decline of population during the
            last 50 or 60 years. Two main reasons are ascribed, the first the growth of
            industrialism and the changed conditions resulting therefrom. Population became urban
            instead of rural, and the conditions in which children were brought up became less and
            less suitable. People were crowded. Housing was inadequate, and the large families went
            to the wall. The incidence of disease increased, and industrial disease came with the
            development of new occupations. The workers were unmercifully exploited. State
            paternalism became necessary, and even in State paternalism certain reasons for the
            decline of family life can be found. At the other end of the social scale other reasons
            can be found for the declining birth-rate. New inventions, and the provision of
            luxuries, provided new ways of spending incomes and leisure. There was less domestic
            help to be had. Finally, people began to think that the woman who became the mother of a
            family was something of a lunatic. About 30 years later she began to be regarded as
            something of a criminal lunatic. In the end the belief developed that it was a social
            virtue to produce fewer and fewer children. Where such a state of affairs exists, it is
            a matter of courage, even of hardihood, to have a family of more than two or three.</para>
                            <para>Still another reason for the declining birth-rate is sometimes advanced, a reason
            belonging to the moral rather than to the economic sphere. It is to be found in that
            strange reluctance to reproduce themselves that has overtaken the peoples of the past in
            the final years of their decline. That is a picture which none of us cares to
            contemplate. I agree with the honorable member for Denison that we cannot hope, merely
            by economic measures, to increase the birth-rate. Certain things are necessary to be
            done in order to ease the burden on families, but they must be looked upon only as
            measures of justice to those who are prepared to face their responsibilities. We need
            maternity and nursing services; we need some kind of domestic help service; we need
            better houses. But those things cannot in themselves revive the falling birth-rate. We
            must look to the basic wage, which at present provides for the needs of three children
            for every man who receives it; yet how many thousands of men in this country have no
            children at all? How many have fewer than three - yet the three notional children of
            the man who has not any militate against the success in life of the children in other
            families of six and seven and eight. The basic wage is meagre enough in all conscience -
            too meagre - but it should be estimated upon the needs of a man and his wife, or of a
            man who must provide later for a wife, and the children should be provided for by an
            extension of the child endowment system. Let the man&#39;s wages be a direct charge upon
            industry, but the children should be a charge on the whole community. If we hope to
            increase the birth-rate we must look to a resurgence of the national spirit, a
            resurgence of national vitality. We must look to a new concept of the dignity and worth
            of the family in the social order. I agree with Paul Bureau that the family is the
            matrix of humanity, the secret laboratory in which every unit of human society is
            prepared, organized and maintained, and if that laboratory is disorganized or chaotic,
            the most serious disorders in social life must be expected.</para>
                            <para>Let us pause for a moment and think, of the time when the war shall end. Many
            speakers in the course of this debate have said that they believe that the war will end
            during the life of this Parliament, and all too many people hope and believe that by the
            attainment of victory we shall step straight into the golden age. Nothing could be more
            foolish, because the golden age will arrive only when you and I and everyone else have
            made some contribution towards it. We shall have to plan for it, and work for it and
            sacrifice ourselves for it. We speak of the men corning back, who must be kept on Army
            rates of pay until suitable work can be found for them. It sounds easy, but it is very,
            very hard. First of all, what is suitable work for each of these men? It will not be
            sufficient merely to let them go out and take any kind of work. The employment offered
            them must provide a reasonable prospect of congenial occupation, perhaps for the greater
            part of their lives. And they will not want to stay on at Army rates of pay. They are
            young, eager and impatient, and they will be heartily sick of everything to do with the
            Army and with war. We must have patience for them. We must be prepared, particularly the
            women, to hold in stability those who have come back still in the grip of the
            restlessness engendered by war. Those who return will be, for the most part, in the age
            group of 20 to 30 years. They must be trained to a trade or profession. Our present
            apprenticeship cannot provide for their needs, and will have to be re-adjusted. Here, I
            believe, trade unionists can and will make a great contribution to national
            re-construction by considering and planning suitable alternatives to the laws which at
            present mean a great deal to them.</para>
                            <para>Almost every honorable member who has touched on this topic has spoken on housing.
            I, too, believe in a scheme of national housing. I believe that it will help in the
            re-absorption into industry of discharged men, but. I believe also that we face a grave
            danger that the housing scheme will be overloaded with unnecessary costs. We have in
            Australia what I call a bricks and mortar complex. We cannot carry on any activity
            without housing it in a palace. We want in the homes that are to be built something less
            than is provided in some of the houses that I have seen designed. We want good walls and
            strong foundations; we want good fittings, but we do not want something that will cost
            more than is necessary. Permanency in a cathedral is a wonderful thing, but no one wants
            a house to last for 300 years. We need houses with sufficient space, so that the
            housewife can work in comfort. There must be space for the children to move about, and
            there must be sufficient space about the house so that it will not readily become a part
            of a crowded slum.</para>
                            <para>There was a reference in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech to an overhaul of the
            man-power situation. I hope that when the Government gives this matter its attention, it
            will re-adjust what I might call man-hours. At the present time, there are thousands of
            women in the services and in munitions factories. By a slight re-adjustment of hours, it
            should be possible for them to receive some training that would fit them for civil life,
            particularly in the domestic sphere where I hope most of them will eventually find their
            place. Each week they could receive one or two hours&#39; training in domestic science
            in canteens attached to munitions establishments, hospitals or military camps, so that
            when the men come home, torn, worn and wrecked, as many of them will be by their war
            experiences, they will have women to meet and greet them who will not be immediately
            harassed by a lack of knowledge of domestic work, and the running of happy homes.</para>
                            <para>Now let me turn just for a moment to the international sphere. I have heard
            expressions of opinion that have surprised and even hurt me, and I have heard some that
            have cheered me greatly. Some honorable members have assured us that there can never be
            any hope that mankind will escape the horror of war that descends upon the world every
            now and then. Others have assured us that by international co-ordination we can usher in
            very quickly the reign of peace for which we all long. I stand somewhere between the two
            schools of thought. Because of what has happened to me in this war I have become
            disillusioned. For years I went about the world preaching the gospel of peace and
            friendship and co-operation. I believed with all my heart in disarmament, but I can
            never again advocate such a policy. I believe that we must arm ourselves to meet
            whatever danger may threaten us, but I also believe that we must co-operate with all
            those forces of good that are working for peace, and with all those people who have a
            will to peace, so that we may do whatever lies in our power to preserve peace in our
            time. However, it is not sufficient merely to co-operate, nor should we limit the sphere
            of goodwill. Surely we can see that if Germany should rise again in Europe, Japan will
            rise again in the east as surely as the sun itself rises. The other evening I, in
            common with many other honorable members, saw a film dealing with the war in Europe.
            There was one scene which portrayed the evacuation from Dunkirk. We saw how the German
            army flowed across the Low Countries and over northern France, and how the small British
            army was squeezed into an ever-decreasing compass, until finally it was compressed into
            the small area immediately around Dunkirk. Then the picture showed a mist on the water,
            and the voice of the announcer said this: &#34; And then out of the mist there came a
            strange flotilla - warships and fishing smacks, and craft of all kinds filled the sea.
            It was the sea-going English come to rescue their own &#34;. And I felt, as I believe
            every other person felt who saw the picture, that this indeed was one of the greatest
            moments in the history of our race. I thought then, as I think now, that we should not
            fail occasionally to pause and look back upon the great moments of our past. We go
            along, thinking always that we progress, but sometimes we have to pause and take stock.
            I think that every Australian should pause now and again and say to himself, &#34; Only
            150 years ago this land was wilderness. Now we have great cities, wonderful feats of
            engineering and beautiful buildings everywhere. And this is still a land of promise
            &#34;. We cannot afford to neglect some recognition of our past, even though we gaze
            into the future.</para>
                            <para>Now, honorable members will forgive me, I know, when I say that I bear the name of
            one of whom it was said in this chamber that to him the problems of government were not
            problems of blue books, not problems of statistics, but problems of human values and
            human hearts and human feelings. That, it seems to me, is a concept of government that we
            might well cherish. It is certainly one that I hold very dear. I hope that I shall
            never forget that everything that takes place in this chamber goes out somewhere to
            strike a human heart, to influence the life of some fellow being, and I believe this,
            too, with all my heart that the duty of every government, whether in this country or any
            other, is to see that no man, because of the condition of his life, shall ever need lose
            his vision of the city of God.</para>

                            <para>. - We who have sat in this chamber to-night have participated in one of the
              historic episodes of our Commonwealth Parliament. For the first time, as the honorable
              member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has said, a member of her sex has stood as an
              equal in this chamber and addressed herself to the problems of the country. It is
              proper that I should say one or two words about the importance of this occasion. Our
              predecessors in this place and in other parliaments have struggled to give to women
              the right to vote and to sit as elected representatives of the people. We know that
              their struggles were met by the same degree of hostility as has marked almost every
              great change which has been contemplated in the affairs of men. The struggle for the
              enfranchisement of women, and for the right of women to sit in legislative assemblies,
              belongs indeed to the great struggle for freedom and free institutions which has
              marked the evolution of our race. I have no &#39;doubt that the first advocates found
              themselves in what could&#39; well be described as an unimportant minority, but
              gradually they won adherents and, in the course of time, the laws were changed, the
              franchise was widened, and women were given the right to vote and to sit in
              Parliament;&#39; but right is one thing and opportunity to exercise it another. It
              remained for the Seventeenth Parliament to assemble before, in either House of this
              Commonwealth Parliament, we&#39; found women elected as representatives of the people,
              and now in each chamber of this Commonwealth Parliament a woman sits, sits not because
              she is a woman, but because she has been elected by the people of Australia. That this
              great event in the development of Australian citizenship should occur during the
              greatest war that our country has ever waged is, I think, not a mere accident; it
              occurs because women, as women, and men, as men, have come to look at problems as
              problems. I have no doubt whatever that the electors of Darwin elected their
              representative because they believed that of the candidates offering she would make
              the best member, and I would respectfully say that that was the view of the people of
              &#34;Western Australia also in making their selection of senators for that State. We
              do not any longer sit here as men, nor does the honorable member for Darwin attempt to
              suggest that she sits here as a woman: we all sit here as persons upon whom our fellow
              citizens have imposed a duty by preferring us to others who offered at the polls. It
              is, as the honorable member for Darwin has said, a very great responsibility that
              devolves upon her shoulders. I have no doubt that all the women of Australia will read
              what she has said to-night. I very respectfully offer my congratulations to the first
              woman who has had the honour to sit in the House of Representatives.</para>

                                in offering my congratulations to the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) on
              her very fine speech. I commend her especially for the confident way in which she
              spoke after having spent only a few days in a place which is calculated, at least on
              the first occasion on which one speaks, to give one a feeling of nervousness or stage
              fright. We have heard a stirring address. In joining with the Prime Minister in
              offering the honorable member my congratulations I do not necessarily mean that I
              agree with all she said. For instance, I have never regretted not having been born in
              1830, for I prefer to live in this era.

                        <para>One would, not expect the Governor-General&#39;s Speech to contain definite
            proposals. Naturally, it dealt in general terms with the important and immediate
            problems that confront this nation, in common with all the democratic countries that
            .are engaged in this frightful conflict. . But the Speech does refer to some very urgent
            matters, foremost are those relating to the winning of the war, but in the second place
            the Speech dealt with the steps that we must take to prepare for the peace.</para>
                        <para class="block">It pointed out- the clear determination of the Government to use all
            our resources in prosecuting the war until it has been won. That was the primary
            consideration which was before the people when the Government was appealing to the
            country just a few short weeks ago. The Speech then goes on to deal with Australia&#39;s
            part in the post-war world. I have come to the &#39;conclusion that we, keeping in mind
            Australia&#39;s geographical position in the Pacific, can never hope to return to
            aloofness of pre-war days when we participated only very slightly in world affairs, for
            I believe that Australia has grown up as a nation and that in the future we shall have
            to take our place in the councils of the Pacific. We shall 11(3  very definitely to keep
            before the rest of the world the fact that we are a Pacific power and have the right to
            sit on all councils dealing with Pacific matters.</para>

                        <para class="block">That paragraph has been canvassed by several honorable members during
            the last few days and I desire, for a little while, to direct my remarks to it. I find
            myself to some extent in agreement with what the honorable member for Darwin said on
            this matter, but I do not go the whole distance that she went, because I do not believe,
            as she does, that, whatever the income of the individual, all should give something,
            however small, &#34; even if it is only a threepenny stamp &#34;. I do not subscribe to
            that view, and very many people of this country are of my mind. In the last couple of
            years, as chairman of the Joint Committee on Social Security, I have had the pleasure of
            examining a very representative cross-section of the people of this country on the
            question of social security - the provision in the post-war world for the care of the
            less fortunate people in the community. It is perfectly true that the cost of social
            security in the final analysis must be borne by the community, whether it be met by
            those on the lower salary range or on the higher salary range or by direct or indirect
            taxation. The Joint Committee on Social Security unanimously recommended that social
            services should be financed on the basis of the ability of a person to pay for them. I
            am gratified to know that the Government has accepted that principle in formulating its
            plan of social services, and I hope that its proposals will be submitted to the
            Parliament in the near future.</para>
                        <para>I was greatly interested to hear the expression of the woman&#39;s view on the
            provision of homes for the people. This subject was also thoroughly investigated by the
            Joint Committee on Social Security, which recommended the establishment of a housing
            planning authority to prepare the blueprints for a vigorous programme of home
            construction after the war. That recommendation has been given effect, and the planning
            authority is now at work. Housing must be undertaken in the post-war era for two
            reasons. First, it will provide employment for a large number of workmen. Secondly, it
            will relieve the present acute shortage of accommodation. Honorable members will be
            interested to learn that the Government saw fit to appoint a woman to the housing
            planning authority in order that the housewife&#39;s view shall not be disregarded in
            the preparation of plans of dwellings. In the past we have neglected that aspect in home
            construction. Men have the requisite knowledge of design and construction, but the
            advice of a woman is needed in determining interior design. Homes should be
            substantially built, have an attractive external appearance, and be fitted with many
            labour-saying devices in order to lighten the duties of the housewife.</para>

                            I had intended to place on record figures relating to the birth-rate and death-rate,
            but as the subject was dealt with extensively by the right honorable member for North
            Sydney
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline>
                            this afternoon, I shall not
            repeat the information. The figures do not make an attractive picture. &#34;We must
            populate this country more rapidly than we have done hitherto. That prompts me to
            discuss the type of persons whom we need. Naturally, Australian babies are the best
            immigrants, but we have neglected the opportunity to increase the Australianborn
            population by our failure to devote sufficient attention to the care of children. The
            infant mortality rate is too high.
                        </para>
                        <para class="block">We lose too many children in the first year of life. The Joint
            Committee on Social Security took a great deal of evidence on ante-natal and post-natal
            care, and the subject forms a part of the report which the committee submitted to the
            last Parliament. I hope that the subject of health and its effect on the birth-rate and
            population will be further investigated during the life of this Parliament, so that
            positive recommendations may be made for arresting the decline. The committee had
            sufficient evidence to satisfy its members that much remains to be done in regard to
            ante-natal and post-natal care of the mother and infant. Members of the Opposition are
            heard advising the Government what ought to be done. For 25 years the United Australia
            party held office almost continuously but neglected this important social service. When
            infants were dying because of lack of proper nourishment, although that nourishment was
            available, anti-Labour governments declared that no money was available to sustain them.
            The unemployed were given the dole, and were expected to provide from that miserable
            pittance proper nourishment for themselves and their children. The mock heroics in which
            members of the Opposition now indulge are not convincing. We cannot dissociate them from
            their failure, although they controlled the legislative machinery of this country for a
            quarter of a century, to improve tie antenatal and post-natal care of mothers and
            children. Now that the Labour Government has a majority in both chambers it should
            boldly tackle this problem and enable Australia to take its place among the most
            progressive nations in the matter of social welfare.</para>

                            Too many of our young people succumb to the ravages of tuberculosis. I direct
            attention to a report published in the Sydney

              Sun</inline>

                        <para>With nowhere else to sleep, a Balmain wife and her two young children share the same
            bedroom1, in which the husband lies dying of T.B.</para>
                        <para>In another industrial suburb a mother and young family lived in close contact for
            weeks with the father who was in the last stages of cancer.</para>
                        <para>These two cases were referred to yesterday by Matron M. Boydell, of the Sydney
            District</para>
                        <para class="block">Nurses&#39; Home, Glebe, when referring to the &#34;hardship and
            suffering&#34; caused through the acute hospital bed shortage.</para>
                        <para class="block">
                            I refer to those cases to emphasize not the acute shortage of hospital
            accommodation, but the necessity for taking proper care of our children. The death-rate,
            due to neglect to treat tuberculosis in its early stages, is appalling. That is one
            reason why our population has not increased as it should have done. Having investigated
            problems of health for eighteen months, I believe that tuberculosis, if properly
            combated, could be almost eradicated from the community in 25 years. I emphasize the
            necessity for granting financial assistance to the dependants of bread-winners who are
            undergoing treatment in sanatoriums, because peace of mind is almost essential to the
            recovery of a patient. At the conclusion of the war, the Government should build more
            sanatoriums for sufferers from tuberculosis. In addition, provision should be made for
            X-raying people in order to detect whether tuberculosis is present. If treatment can be
            commenced in the early stages of the disease, the patient has an excellent chance of
            being restored to health. lt is interesting to study the social welfare policies of
            other countries. This afternoon the right honorable member for North Sydney described
            what had been done by Italy and Germany to encourage family life, and the bearing of
            children. I shall refer briefly to what has been done in Sweden. An article appears in
            the
                            <inline font-style="italic">International Labour Review</inline>
                            of June, 1939,
            entitled &#34; A Programme for Family Security in Sweden &#34;. The author, Alva Myrdal,
            is a very eminent woman, who has written extensively on this subject. She has described
            the inquiries that have been undertaken in Sweden into proposals for increasing the
            birth-rate, and improving the living conditions of the people. The article states - l t
            thus became apparent that if - children were to continue to be born, in a country on its
            way to democratic equalization, some important modifications had to be made in the
            social system and, the structure of social reforms. The aim of these changes must be to
            allot to children a greater share in the resources of the nation. Part of the economic
            burden of bringing up children had to be transferred from the responsibility of the
            individual family to that of the community.

                        <para class="block">The Joint Committee on Social Security was convinced that the nation

              spite of the progress of pre-natal care during the last decades, large sections of
              society were still neglected in this respect. The health of many women was
              unnecessarily endangered by defective pre-natal medical supervision. In particular,
              public sentiment was aroused by the great disparity in infant mortality between
              different social and economic classes. It was clearly indicated that the lives of
              thousands of infants could be saved every year - for their families and for the nation
              - if all infants were given the same medical care as was available for those of
              families in the richer classes.</para>

              Establishment of the centres is in progress, but has been delayed in some provinces
              because of the requirement for authorization of the State grant that a complete plan
              for future work throughout the province must be submitted and approved. Access to the

            Swedish programme also provided for children&#39;s pensions. In this connexion the

                            <para>The first recommendation covered the eases of orphans and children of widows or of
              invalid fathers. In all these cases the incomeearning capacity of the main supporter
              is permanently lacking: hence an allowance with the character of a pension was
              justified. It was proposed to institute monthly State pensions, to be handled by the
              local pension boards which&#39; had been set up to deal with other national pensions.
              Like these other pensions, the children&#39;s pensions should not be subject to
              arbitrary decisions; they should be considered a civic right in specified
              circumstances - namely, where family income is below a certain fixed amount, varying
              for different regions in accordance with their position on a cost of living scale.</para>

                        <para class="block">It is impossible to say what the effects of the Swedish legislation
            have been because the measure was passed only in 1937, and since the outbreak of the war
            in 1939 very little information has been obtainable by us on the subject. The article
            from which 1 have quoted also deals with marriage loans, nutrition, health supervision
            and reduced medical costs for children, education, pre-school institutions and
            recreational facilities, employment of married women and adaptation of the reforms to
            urban and rural conditions.</para>
                        <para>Reference is also made to the highly controversial subject of the sterilization of
            the unfit, and that will have to be considered sooner or later by every country which
            desires an Al population. I believe that the extracts that I have made from
            thiswell-written and highly informative article will prove of interest to all who desire
            to know what social service measures are being taken. The approach to the subject in
            that interesting country, Sweden, gives us food for thought.</para>
                        <para>The necessity to increase our population has been referred to in the course of this
            debate. I believe that the solution to this problem is largely economic. We must not
            only increase our birth-rate, but we must also ensure that provision shall be made for
            the financial assistance of parents. Families should not have to suffer avoidable
            financial embarrassment. It is essential that adequate housing shall be provided for the
            people and that they shall be assured of decent living conditions. We must tackle the
            slum problem, for slum areas are undoubtedly breeding places for disease. Tuberculosis,
            in particular, should be tackled in its early stages. We should provide adequately for
            maintenance of sufferers from tuberculosis, and where necessary build sanitoriums where
            treatment can be given at every stage of the disease. People who suffer from
            tuberculosis at an advanced stage should be treated in appropriately equipped
            institutions, and those who suffer from the disease in its early stages should be taught
            in suitable institutions how to care for themselves, so that they will not he a danger
            to other people in the community when they resume their normal life in their own homes.
            The Social Security Committee inspected many institutions for the care of tubercular
            patients. I have in mind in particular an institution at Woorooloo, in Western Australia
            which is under the supervision of an excellently qualified medical practitioner who has
            brought to his work a keen enthusiasm, and a wide general knowledge of the subject which
            he has acquired in other countries. The inmates there do a certain amount of work of a
            suitable character which is designed to fit them to become useful members of society
            upon their discharge.</para>
                        <para>The subjects with which I have been dealing come to my mind as parts of the social
            security programme that we must apply in the post-war world. We have been able to
            finance the gigantic cost of the war, , and I believe that if we have the will to do so
            we shall be able to finance the important social service projects that should be put in
            hand for the benefit of the people in the post-war years. Money is not the most
            important consideration to-day; man-power and materials are of greater significance. But
            if the four freedoms concerning which we speak so much are to be translated into terms
            of daily living, we must provide the men and materials necessary to establish
            institutions of the kind to which I have referred. I am sure that our people will desire
            to provide conditions under which Australians will be able to develop healthy bodies and
            virile qualities of citizenship. If our hopes for the postwar world are to be realized
            we must put all possible preparatory work in hand immediately.</para>
