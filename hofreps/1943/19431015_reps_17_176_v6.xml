                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Towards the end  of  last year a special Constitution Convention was summoned at Canberra to deal with proposals to extend the powers of the Parliament  of  the Commonwealth in order to enable the problems  of  post-war reconstruction to be dealt with effectively. Those who attended comprised representatives of both Houses in the Commonwealth Parliament, including the party leaders in each House. The States were represented by the Premiers and the Leaders of the Opposition. It was unanimously agreed that additional powers in relation to post-war reconstruction were required by the Commonwealth. However, it was considered more practicable, in order to avoid a referendum during the war, that the additional powers should be conferred upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth by reference from the State legislatures under section  51  (xxxvii) of the Constitution. Accordingly, fourteen heads of power were defined and agreed to by representatives of the Commonwealth and by the Premiers of the six States. In order to give effect to the arrangement, a draft bill was also agreed upon. The present position of the draft bill is as follows: The State legislatures of Kew South Wales and Queensland have passed the bill. South Australia and Western Australia have passed bills, but in each case the powers granted are less than those agreed upon tit- Canberra. Victoria has passed the bill, but has imposed the condition that it shall not operate unless the other five States have previously passed a bill in substantially the same form as the Canberra draft bill. In the State of Tasmania the Upper House has shelved the bill. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>All State governments had their legal advisers at the Canberra convention, and the point was not then raised that it was not constitutionally competent for the State legislatures to refer the matters to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for the time agreed upon, namely, a period to terminate five years after the cessation of hostilities in the present war. However, legal opinions were subsequently obtained by several State Governments, to the effect that, under section  51  (xxxvii) of the Constitution any references of matters by the State legislatures must be made without limit of time. This opinion is by no means accepted by the Commonwealth, and endeavours will be made to obtain an authoritative ruling from the courts as to whether or not the method of reference provided for in the draft bill is permissible under the Constitution. The Commonwealth Government is of the opinion that the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. It might, of course, be possible for the Commonwealth to pass legislation on post-war reconstruction to operate only in those States that have passed ##'##the Commonwealth Powers Bill. This would probably be detrimental to the interests of those States which, not having passed the bill, would necessarily be excluded from the scope of Commonwealth legislation on certain aspects of post-war reconstruction. However, such Commonwealth legislation could not be regarded as satisfactory from an Australian point of view. For these reasons, I am in agreement with the Attorney-General that, unless the substance of the Canberra arrangement be carried into effect in all six States, it will be necessary to submit proposals for the alteration of the Constitution to the electors of the Commonwealth by referendum. Admittedly, additional powers are required by the Commonwealth Parliament for post-war reconstruction purposes. The present intention of the Government is to deal with these important matters of Constitution alteration at the next session of the Parliament. By that time we should be acquainted with the final decision of the State legislatures as to whether or not they intend to carry into effect the arrangements made at the Canberra convention by all six State Premiers. </para>

Treblico  Deputy  Commissioner of the Taxation Central Office, as  chairman,  has been examining and reporting upon various taxation matters that, have been referred to from time to time by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> At the present time this advisory committee is examining, at the Treasurer##'##s request, several of the most important aspects of this problem. This particular inquiry is directed specifically  to the problem arising from cases of hardship upon retirement, death, or where there are violent fluctuations of income from one year to another - which is the crux of the whole matter. I understand that the solution is not proving easy. If the report, which is expected this month, puts forward a solution to meet cases of these types a much simpler reform in taxation administration will be evolved than would be the case if a full pay as you earn plan of taxation were adopted. </para>
                <para>Quite apart from this taxation advisory committee##'##s report, however, the Commissioner of Taxation has had the pay as you earn proposals examined and reported upon by a panel of his own expert officers. When the advisory committee##'##s report is to hand, the Government will refer both reports to the proposed parliamentary committee for examination and report to the House. Should the House be in recess when the report becomes available, by arrangement with the leaders of the Opposition parties, T propose to nominate the parliamentary committee and allow it to function until the House re-assembles, w##"##hen it may be formally constituted by resolution of the  House </para>

A similar request lias been received from many portions of the Commonwealth, and one has come from the Department of Agriculture of a leading State. As there is an acute shortage of eggs, I shall readily acquiesce in the taking of whatever action may result in an increase of egg production - or of food supplies generally. I have requested the Egg Control Board to consent to the variation of the existing arrangement in order that individual householders may keep a maximum of 40 birds without being obliged to register. </para>

It is hoped that the Munitions Department will be able to transfer men from one branch of its own activities to another where they may be needed. If there are surplus men in the Munitions Department, the man-power authorities will certainly try to place them in the city or town in which they are now residing. </para>

                        <para>- Committees have been set up to advise the Controller of Rubber regarding priority in the issue of rubber tyres for motor vehicles. Although these committees are working well, it sometimes happens that no tyres are available at a particular place when they are urgently required for the carrying on of essential services. Will the Minister for Supply and Shipping establish in important country towns small stocks of tyres which can be released by the local committee in an emergency? </para>

                        <para>- I remind the honorable member that the position in regard to rubber is desperate in this country, as, indeed, it is in all countries engaged in the war on our side. It is not necessary for me to stress that point - it is obvious to every one. For that reason, we have had to exercise extraordinarily strict control over the use of rubber. However, the honorable member##'##s suggestion is worthy of sympathetic consideration in order to meet those cases in which it is absolutely necessary to provide transport for the maintenance of essential services. I. shall look into the matter. </para>

The honorable member referred to certain press statements about this officer, and asked whether a full and complete investigation could be made to determine the truth of the statements which he is purported to have made in regard to his service in the front line in New Guinea. I have made inquiries, and now desire to inform the honorable member that it is not proposed to make any investigation of the nature suggested by him, as there is no evidence to indicate that Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay made any such statements. Allegations have been made that the award of the Distinguished Service Order to this officer was associated with such press statements, and in order to assure the honorable member that such was not the (use, I quote from the citation of his General Officer Commanding at the time he was recommended for this award - </para>

                    <para>The award of the Distinguished Service Order to a commanding officer of a unit is regarded as a mark of commendation, not of the commanding officer alone, but also of the valuable and gallant services rendered by the whole unit. To those who are aware of the outstanding performances of the individual members of the special force which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay, there can be no doubt that the award in this instance was a well-deserved recognition of the unit as a whole. The Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, with whom I have consulted, has confirmed this view, and, in addition, has stated that he was in constant touch with Lieu tenant-  Colonel Fleay  during the period that he was in New Guinea, that he was visited frequently by senior officers, and that he commanded a small detached force with gallantry, enterprise and vigour, and proved himself a first-rate leader in tactics of this kind. Lieutenant-General Blarney added: ##"##I am. satisfied that Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay is a very gallant and enduring officer, and that he is the last person who would attempt to take away credit from other persons ##"##. </para>
                    <para>Prior to his service in New Guinea Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay, who, in 1939, joined up in the ranks, had a record of excellent service with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. He went to the Middle East with the 6th Division, fought in the ##"##Western Desert and in Greece, was wounded in Crete, and returned to Australia with his division, and subsequently served in New Guinea. The honorable member referred to the service of members of the 5th Independent Company. This was only one of the companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Fleay during the period to which he refers. </para>

                    <para class="block">The main purpose of this bill is to provide for the issue of national savings stamps in connexion with the raising of Commonwealth war loans. It has been found that the most convenient method for wage-earners to subscribe to loans by instalments is by means of deductions from wages. Where employees remain continuously on the one pay-roll, this presents no difficulty, and deductions are made regularly until the payment for bonds has been completed. There are, however, people whose employment is constantly changing, and in these cases it is not practicable to make deductions from wages in this way. In order to provide for such subscribers, and also for those who wish to set aside small amounts as they become available, it has been decided to introduce the 5s. national savings stamp. Folders containing 40 stamps will be provided, the face value of which will amount to ##£##10, and these may be accepted in payment for treasury bonds. Alternately, stamps to the face value of ##£##2, or multiples thereof, may be accepted in payment of instalments for bonds. National savings stamps may be paid to the credit of depositors##'## accounts with all savings banks. The banks will, in turn, exchange the stamps for war loan securities. The stamps will be on sale at all savings banks, money order post offices, and such other selling points as are decided on from time to time. This measure makes provision for the protection of war savings stamps and national savings stamps against forgery and uttering, similar to that made in regard to treasury-bills in the Treasury Bills Act. </para>

                        <para>.- The Opposition enthusiastically supports this measure for the issue of national savings stamps, by which the Treasurer . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> hopes to widen the field of investment in liberty loans. No effort should be spared to ensure that people whose earnings have risen as the result of the war shall contribute a part of those earnings to the national war fund by means of investment in loans. I believe the issue of 5s. war savings stamps will attract many more subscribers than might otherwise have been the case. It is essential that the loans be filled if we are to conduct the war to our full capacity. </para>

                        <para>. - I support this measure, but I regret that the bill does not go farther and contain an amendment of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, to provide that treasury bonds shall be converted to inscribed stock. Time and again during the budget debate honorable members stressed the fact that one of the most fruitful methods of evasion of income tax is investment in treasury bonds. No record is made of the owners or of people to whom interest is paid. In effect, treasury bonds are another form of currency at a time when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> himself admits that the slightest slackening of controls on the monetary system may lead to heavy inflation, with disastrous results. The Treasurer, as a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, should know that when all the resources of the nation are fully employed, when it is impossible to produce more goods, and when treasury-bill finance is being used, there is great danger of inflation of the currency, with a steep rise of prices, unless all the necessary controls are maintained. One of the most effective controls would be the conversion of bonds to inscribed stock. That would enable the Treasurer to know exactly who are the holders of the stock issued in return for moneys lent to the Government. He would then be able to watch closely the holders of the inscribed stock, with a view to preventing evasion of taxation. It is probably too late to insert in this measure such a provision as I have in mind, but the Treasurer should take early action to do as I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>.- I again urge the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to reconsider my proposal made on a previous occasion that Commonwealth bonds be accepted by the Treasury as payment of probate duty. I have been in touch with many people -who would be willing to invest more heavily in liberty loans and other loans but for the fact that they are compelled to keep in reserve money in some form more easily negotiable than bonds, lest their estate should be suddenly called upon to pay heavy probate duties. I believe the objection to this proposal in the past was that executors of estates of deceased persons would be able to buy on the market at a discount, bonds which would be tendered at their face value in payment of probate duty, but now that the prices of bonds are pegged that objection no longer holds good. </para>

                            <para>- It is not always possible to find a buyer in time, and the Taxation Department is not prone to wait. Therefore, people are apt to take the prudent course of holding reserves against probate duty in some more easily negotiable form than treasury bonds or inscribed stock. Any abuses could be quickly rectified. The objections to the change no longer exist. The granting of the concession would, I believe, result in very many more subscriptions to war loans. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it must not be forgotten that we are asking people to invest in loans and we have to take their desires into consideration. My recollection of the matter raised by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> is that the Loan Council discussed the proposal that probate duties should be payable with bonds, but the objection taken was that executors of deceased persons would perhaps be able to buy bonds at a discount. I concede that the pegging of the prices of bonds has changed the circumstances. I think that bonds issued before 1934 are accepted in payment of probate duty. At any rate,  r  agree with the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> that bonds can always be sold to either the general public or the National Debt Sinking Fund Com-, mission. Payments into the sinking fund are increasing in proportion to the increase of the national debt, and next, year it is expected that the commission  Will  be on the market for ##£##20,000,000 worth of bonds. However, the honorable member##'##s suggestion will be re-examined by the Treasury and further discussed by the Loan Council. </para>

                        <para>.- On the 28th September the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> tabled the report of the royal commission on the alleged missing document relating to defence plans. He made no comment, but simply moved that the paper be printed. The Opposition considers that this important matter cannot be allowed to rest at that point. We have no wish to revive the controversy over ##"## the Brisbane line##"##; we believe that that has been dealt with fully by the royal commissioner in his report and the Prime Minister in statements from time to time. That particular canard has been disposed of, but there are issues affecting the responsibility of Parliament upon which Parliament must be expected to have a definite view. A part of my purpose will br- to record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the developments  since Parliament, last met. I regret that the Prime Minister is not present because what I shall say on behalf of the Opposition hasa direct bearing on what we consider his responsibility to be as a custodian of the prestige of Parliament. I hope that he will be able to make some comment, ata later stage of this debate, on the representations which will be made to him as##'## to his duty. A good deal of my speech will consist of the reading of documents relevant to this matter, which the Opposition desires to place on record. In order to refresh the minds of honorable members on the subject, I take them back to the statement made in the House on the 22nd June by the then Minister for Labour and National Service. It, reads - </para>

J. Ward, Minister of State for Labour and National Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Villeneuve</inline> Smith, K.C., of Adelaide, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> D. Phillips, of Melbourne, asked leave to appear to represent the Menzies and Fadden administrations. This application I did not accede to, but allowed counsel to attend and watch the proceedings on behalf of these administrations, both in public and <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> and reserved leave to them to apply at any stage to take part in the proceedings. No such application was made, save that at the conclusion of the final sitting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Villeneuve</inline> Smith made a written submission to me as to the findings which I should make and report. ##"## Fifteen witnesses were called and examined before the commission, of whom only one, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden, gave evidence in public.  His  evidence is recorded in the transcript of the proceedings. Theproceedings <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> were not recorded by the shorthand writers and of them no transcript is available. I personally took such notes as appeared to me to be necessary to guide me in making my report. ##"## At the outset of the proceedings <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry</inline> submitted to me that the whole of the questions which I was asked to report upon were beyond the power of the commission to deal with, on the ground that they arose out of and necessarily depended upon a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> in Parliament, namely, the House of Representatives, on 22nd June, 1943. The first question, he contended, showed on its face that such was the position, and the remaining questions were mere appendages to the first question and their fate must be determined by the fate of the first question. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Villeneuve</inline> Smith whether he wished to address me on the question so raised. He replied that he was instructed to make no submission on the point. After hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller,</inline> I ruled that, even assuming <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry##'##s</inline> submission to be correct in regard to the first three questions, the fourth question stood on a different plane, and required me to report in any event on an independent question of fact. Thereafter, I proceeded to take evidence mainly in relation to the fourth question, reserving for further consideration my decision as to the correctness or otherwise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry##'##s</inline> contention in relation to the first three questions. Ultimately, on the final day of the sittings, I ruled, forreasons which are set out in the transcript, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry##'##s</inline> submission must be given effect to in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> himself and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> could not be compelled by the commission to attend or to give evidence in regard to his statement, the subject matter of the first question. I ruled, however, that the privilege which de barred the commission from examining <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> himself did not debar it from investigating the truth or otherwise of any aspersion contained in the statement which reflected upon persons who were not members of Parliament, or officers of either House of Parliament. This ruling necessarily involved my putting a construction upon the statement itself, and in particular determining what were the implications of the phrase ##'## most reliably informed ##'##. I thought that these words would convey to any reasonable reader or hearer of them that information had been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> out of Parliament and otherwise than in the course of his or their duty by a person or persons whose position was such that he or they would in all probability have access to accurate information, and that his or their credibility was such that there was no reason to doubt his or their statements. I interpreted the statement as meaning that the information was given out of Parliament and otherwise than in the course of duty, for these reasons: If the information had been given in Parliament, it would have been recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and, if given to the Minister in the course of the duty of the informant, or informants, I could see no reason why the Minister would not have so stated. I then asked myself what persons came within such a category. I thought that the proper custodians of ##'##official files##'## and such other officers as properly had access to those files certainly came within it. If any of such officers had divulged information to the Minister that a document was missing from the official files as alleged, it seemed to me that such officer might be subject to criminal prosecution either under section 73a of the Defence Act which provides - </para>
                    <para>Any member of the Defence Force or officer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth who communicates to any person otherwise than in the course of his official duty any plan, document or information relating to any fort, battery, field work, fortification or defence work or to any of the defences of the Commonwealth or to any factory or air force aerodrome or establishment or any other naval, military or air force information shall be guilty of an offence,##'## ##"## or under section 70 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which provides that - ##"####'##Any person who, being a Commonwealth officer, publishes or communicate any fact which comes to his knowledge by virtue of his office and which it is his duty to keep secret, or any document which comes to his possession by virtue of his office and which it is his duty to keep secret, except to some person to whom he is authorized to publish or communicate it, shall be guilty of an offence ##'## ##"##. ##"## I think I should state specifically that I had evidence from members of the Defence Committee before whom plans would come and from the Chief of Staffs Committee. In order to answer the questions put to me it was necessary for me to determine what was meant by the expression ##'## official files ##'## and ##'## Brisbane </para>
                    <para class="block">Lino##'##. To take the latter first. I informed my mind by reading the debate of 22nd June, 1943, as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the sense in which the expression was used, and witnesses were also questioned as to their knowledge of the expression. No officer either of the Australian Military Forces, the  Royal  Australian Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force knew of any plan which related to a Brisbane Line##'## so called and all stated that their only knowledge of such an expression was derived from press reports or like sources. They did have knowledge, however, of what was called an ##'##appreciation##'## submitted I <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay in February, 1.942. Thi9 appreciation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay stated in evidence before me, was submitted by him voluntarily of his own motion to the Government of the day. No officer who gave evidence before me was aware of any plan other than this in relation to the matters <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay dealt with. I sought from witnesses evidence as to all the files which related to matters which were the subject-matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay##'##s report, and I was given precise information as to those files. There was called before me every officer whose duty it was to have the custody of any of those files, and also every officer who had the right of access to any of them. Each of those officers, without exception, swore that he or she had given no information to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> in relation to any document, and most of those officers did not even know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward.</inline> I accept the testimony of all these officers. ##"## It occurred to me that, apart from the officers I have referred to, the words ##'## most reliably informed ##'## might point to members of the War Cabinet or of the Advisory War Council to whom copies of documents are, in the usual routine of procedure, distributed. I considered whether I should cause to bc called before me all or any of such persons in order to question them in relation to any aspersion which might rest upon them by reason of the implication of the words. I assumed (without determining) that my ruling on the question of privilege would not affect such members, but on consideration I carnie to the conclusion that I should not have them called. Some of those in this particular class are Ministers of the Crown, all are members of Parliament, and those who are not Ministers of the Crown, are all or almost all persons who have been Ministers of the Crown. It is inconceivable to me that if any honorable member had given information to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward,</inline> he would not, after hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward##'##s</inline> assertion, have made some statement himself in regard to the allegation. If he had given the information, I should suppose he would have stated so, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> fails to disclose that any of them did. It also occurred to me that it was possible that some officer not within the category of those I have already mentioned might have had temporary access without authority to official files, and might have surreptitiously obtained information from the files, and communicated it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward.</inline> I considered whether I should make any inquiry calculated to investigate this possibility. I determined that I should not, because I thought that no </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister of the Crown receiving information from such a source would consider the person giving it a most reliable informant within the implication which I have attached to the words ##'## Most reliably informed ##'##. I hope that these two assumptions will do no injustice to any one. It is of course possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> has attached some meaning to the words  Most reliably informed ##'## other than that which I have indicated above but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward##'##s</inline> evidence was not available on this commission, this possibility is one that I have been unable to investigate. ##"## The whole of the evidence, without exception, was to the effect that the official files were intact and that no document relating to the ##'## Brisbane Line ##'## had been or was missing from thom. I should add that, beyond satisfying myself as to the method of recording documents, and that the system was adequate to keep trace of the fate of a document, and would disclose whether or not a document was missing, I did not personally investigate the liles. To have done so would have been a herculean task incapable of accomplishment within any reasonable time, and one which I felt to be unnecessary in view of the fact that I thought the evidence of the witnesses who spoke to the completeness of the files entirely trustworthy, and, moreover, no challenge was made of it by cross-examination. ##"##I now address myself to the particular questions asked in the commission : - ##"## 1 . I am unable to answer this question, for the reasons which I have already stated. ##"## 2. I can give only a limited answer to this question, namely, that the Minister was not informed by any officer who had the custody of the official files or by any officer who had access thereto, or by any member of the Defence Committee or by any of the Chiefs of Stan##'##s Committee. ##"## 3. In view of the above answers, no answer is required to this question. ##"## 4. No document concerning the matter known as the ##'## Brisbane Line ##'## was on 22nd June, 1943, or is now, missing from the official files.##"## </para>

                            considering  the report of the Royal Commissioner, the Government decided that it  to  clear that the raising of the issue of the rights and privileges of members of the  Parliament  precluded a determination of the substance of the questions involved in the terms of reference! These matters, therefore, have not been decided and the Government has directed that, as the question of the rights  ii  nd privileges of. members of the Parliament is involved, the matter is one which cannot be completed until a submission has been made to Parliament of the -matters that litiv.1.1 arisen. The Government has directed that, this submission bc made at the earliest opportunity. Therefore, the substance of questions Nos. 1.. 2 and .3 in the terms of reference are in effect sti.ll

                    </quote>
                    <para>I desire to make certain comments on the facts which the documents disclose. First, I am sure that honorable members will be glad to have confirmation of their belief that no senior officer of .the defence administration was implicated in any way in this matter. The report of the royal commission, limited though it was in -.cope, owing to the attitude adopted by counsel for the Minister then under suspension, was quite emphatic on that point. No senior officer connected with our defence administration has any cloud of suspicion banging over him. The House will welcome that exoneration. Secondly, the commission was equally emphatic that no document was missing at the date at which the statements were made in this House by the then Minister. Thirdly, the commission found, as a fact, that no military appreciation was submitted to any government before February, 1942, which waa four or five months after the Curtin Administration assumed office. Therefore, no ##"## Brisbane line ##"## had been drawn prior to February. 1942, by the Curtin Administration, or by any previous administration. Fourthly - and this returns Ure matter to the purview of this Parliament - <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> come to the circumstances in  which  the then Minister claimed privilege as a member of the Parliament in order to refrain from answering the first three questions .submitted to the royal commission. Those questions were: first, whether the Minister was .most reliably informed on a certain matter; secondly, whether he was informed in the terms, or to the effect, specified in the statement which he had made; and, thirdly, if the information was given to him, by whom, in what circumstances, and for what reason it was given. The commissioner was prevented from making any inquiry into these circumstances by the plea made by counsel on behalf of the Minister that to do so would amount to a breach of hi3 privilege as a member of this Parliament. The privileges of members of Parliament are traditional and long-standing, and I agree .that the members of this House must jealously guard them. But, on behalf of the Opposition, I ask the Prime Minister to consider whether Parliament did not waive its privilege in order to secure the desired information. I .submit that the claim to privilege was waived, in effect, if not specifically, when the right honorable gentleman reported to the House that a royal commission had been appointed to make its inquiries and the House took no objection to that procedure. I believe that it can be truthfully claimed that the action of appointing the commission was endorsed by all honorable members except the .honorable gentleman who was under suspension, and the then honorable member for Bourke, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackburn.</inline> I have no doubt whatever that if the Parliament had been asked to intimate that it waived the claim of privilege in order that the desired inquiries could be made it would have done so and would have given the royal commission complete authority to make the investigation. Because the claim of privilege was made before the commission, the inquiry was balked, and this is the first time that the matter has since come before the Parliament for us to express our view as to whether investigation should have proceeded and the plea of privilege waived. My next comment is that, although the then. Minister was suspended from his office pending the answering of the questions by the royal commission, the important questions remain unanswered. The Prime </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister regards the issues raised as being important, for in his letter to. his colleague he said that, because of the plea advanced by the honorable gentleman##'##s counsel, vital questions in the -terms of reference were beyond the power of the commissioner to deal with, and the commission had not dealt with them. The Government had decided that, because the issue of the rights and privilege of members of the Parliament had been raised a submission should be made to the Parliament. The Government had, therefore, directed that such a submission should be made at the earliest possible moment, and that until that was done the matter was still- <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and the Minister would continue to abstain from, the performance of his duties. </para>
                    <para>The only question which was answered <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> the one in regard to which there was no dispute, for both- the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Labour and National Service had already stated publicly that they did not believe that any document was missing. So far as the Parliament was concerned, therefore, the only question which the royal commission answered was the question which the Parliament considered had already been answered. </para>
                    <para>If there was adequate reason for the Prime Minister to continue the suspension of his colleague after the report of the royal commission was submitted, and until the unanswered questions had been resolved, there is still adequate reason to continue such suspension, for the matters are still unresolved. The Prime Minister said that the Government had decided that a submission should be made to the House at the earliest possible opportunity. I claim that he is, therefore, called upon to make such a submission. As he has not done so, the House is entitled to know the reason why. Although these questions have remained unanswered, the suspended Minister has been given a portfolio in the new Government in a new capacity. The Opposition considers that an obligation rests upon the Prime Minister, as the custodian of. the prestige and authority of the Parliament, to clear this matter up at the earliest possible moment, and to take all necessary steps to protect parliamentarytraditions and maintain the high stan dard of conduct that is expected from ministries and Cabinet Ministers. As the right honorable gentleman considered it necessary to relieve his colleague of his duties while these matters remained, undetermined, he should take steps to have them determined at the earliest possible moment, and make a submission to the House in regard to them. The House cannot be satisfied with the present attitude of the Government on this subject. If there was good cause to suspend a Minister- in order to hold an inquiry, and if, as I believe, to be the fact, the House waived the. plea of privilege in order to have the. matters investigated, the Opposition  considers  that the Minister involved should not be allowed to take refuge in the technical plea of privilege. Wo feel that an obligation rests upon the Government and the House to reach finality on these issues. We therefore press the Prime Minister to make a submission to the House in- the terms of his letter of the 14th July, and to indicate the attitude of the Government on the subject. We surely cannot allow the highly important issues to which T have referred to remain undetermined. </para>

                        <para>.- I am astounded that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> who is said to be an eminent legal practitioner, and who previously considered this subject to be of so much importance as to demand the appointment of a royal commission to investigate it, should now apparently consider it to be so unimportant that he is not in attendance when it is being dealt with by the House. I am astounded, that the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> who also had a great deal to say on this subject when it wa3 previously before the House, should now also have deserted the Opposition. The brief has been left to a junior member, if not the office boy. of the firm. I recognize that, under very difficult circumstances, that honorable gentleman has been called upon to make a face-saving speech for the Opposition. He has read copies of several documents, the contents of which were already well known, and##'## on these he has made certain submissions. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">He began by saying that he had no wish to revive the subject because the canard had been exploded. There has been an explosion, but all of the casualties have been among Opposition members. On the last occasion on which I addressed the House on this subject the Opposition benches were fairly full. A decision in the matter has been given by the highest authority in the land, an authority higher than the Parliament or a royal commission, namely, the people; hence the many casualties in the ranks of the Opposition parties. To the honorable member for Fawkner has been entrusted to-day the task of submitting a case on behalf of the Opposition. I remind him that when the terms of reference of the royal commission were mentioned, I told this House that the inquiry would prove abortive, because the terms were so limited as to make impossible an investigation of the charges I had made against the Menzies and Fadden administrations. ##'## The honorable member now wants to place on the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> responsibility for the result. At the time of the appointment of the royal commission the Labour party did not have a majority in this House; consequently, because of pressure by certain honorable members the Prime Minister was compelled to submit to the royal commissioner distinctly limited terms of reference, which prevented that gentleman from making an inquiry into my charges. Those terras had the approval of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> who was then the Leader of the Opposition; he was consulted continuously before they were announced. Surely he was advised by the legal men on his side as to what the powers of the royal commission would be ! The honorable member for Fawkner now talks about the privileges of members, and claims that they must be protected. Surely he and -other members of the Opposition must have known that the royal commission would not have the power to compel me to give evidence concerning any utterance I had made in this House! In any event, parliamentary privilege is not held by every member individually, but is the privilege of the Parliament as such ; in other words, the privilege of the people. It would be fundamentally wrong, and a blow at the basis of democracy itself, if any member of Parliament could be subjected to interrogation outside in respect of statements he had made inside this legislature. I have never balked an inquiry; I would have welcomed the most complete investigation of my charges. But that was not desired by members of the Opposition. They were not anxious that I should be given the opportunity to have a complete investigation. They knew that they were approaching a general election, and they wanted a ##"##facesaver##"##. They wished to be able to say to the people, ##"## A royal commission was appointed to investigate the matter, and it has found nothing ##"##. The royal commission could not find anything, because the terms of reference were so limited that it could not inquire into the charges 1 had made. Being most vitally affected, I considered that I should have had a voice in the framing of the terms of reference. Certain suggestions and recommendations were made by me for their extension, but when the terms were announced they were found to be identical with those requested by the Leader of the Opposition. The honorable member for Fawkner has conceded that before the Parliament, had been prorogued one of the questions into which the royal commissioner was appointed to inquire had been answered in this House. A great deal was made of my- statement of the 22nd June concerning a document. The Opposition, seized upon that statement. Honorable members opposite believed that they would be able to divert attention from the merit of my charges, to some argument in relation to my statement concerning a document which, I had been informed, had been missing. My charges were not based upon that document. I had received this information after I had made charges against the Menzies and Fadden administrations in Victoria, and during my visit to Tasmania. What the public wanted to know was, whether or not there was any truth in those charges. The honorable member for Fawkner now asks why the Prime Minister, having suspended the Minister for Labour and National Service, does not take positive action. The Prime </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister was impelled to the action he took, because members of the Opposition demanded it, and were able to enforce their demand. Never on any occasion did my colleagues doubt my integrity. The Prime Minister has presented the report of the royal commission for which the Opposition asked. The honorable member for Fawkner says that the right honorable gentleman has not taken positive action. The motion for the printing of the report has the effect of submitting the matter to the House. If the Opposition wants further action to be taken, it can move in that direction. All the legal luminaries opposite are absent from their places to-day, and it has been left to a junior member to make the best case of which he is capable. I have not been advised that the Leader of the Opposition has met with an accident, that he is ill, or that he has been called away on urgent national business. He knew that this matter was to be debated. The motion in regard to ifc has appeared on the notice-paper for some time, and only a few days ago the Prime Minister stated that an opportunity to debate it would be afforded. If those members of the Opposition who are absent consider that it is important, why are they not in their places, prepared to debate it? The honorable member for Fawkner has quoted extensively the report of the royal commissioner. It can readily be imagined that by the limited terms of reference the commissioner was seriously hampered. In his report, he has stated that certain officers of the department were not those who had advised or informed me. I agree with that, and am prepared to say that, on the evidence that the commissioner had before him, he has reported correctly. When the announcement of the appointment of the royal commission was made in this House I said that, having had a consultation with the Prime Minister, I was satisfied that at that stage no document was missing from the official files. If honorable members care to engage in a lengthy debate as to what constitutes official files, and how many persons have access to them at one time or another, I can easily show them that, because of the limited scope of the inquiry, it would be quite impossible to say that every person had been interrogated who at one time or another may have had access to what are known as official files. Official files need not necessarily mean files in the possession of the administrative head of the Department of Defence. That was never suggested. There are all sorts of reports and recommendations in respect of defence matters on innumerable files, and numerous persons have access to them. From the outset there was never any doubt in my mind that there was no need for a royal commission if the terms of reference were to be framed to prevent a full inquiry into my charges concerning ##"## the Brisbane line##"## strategy. Members of the Opposition now have the opportunity, if they so desire, to take positive action to ensure, as the honorable member for Fawkner has said, that the will of Parliament shall not be balked. Of the way in which the will of the Parliament has been balked, as he implies, I am unaware. The people have expressed their view. My electors have shown clearly their attitude in regard to the charges that I made; they returned me with the largest majority that any man had ever received in the East Sydney electorate - an absolute majority of more than 20,000 votes over the votes of four other candidates. I am satisfied that the Opposition has never desired a full inquiry into my charges. The honorable member for Fawkner may consider that, because of the stand taken by my counsel, I balked an inquiry. I had not to determine whether or not the point that he took should be put to the royal commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry,</inline> K.C., my counsel, advised me that it was his duty as a legal man to draw the commissioner##'##s attention to the law, and said that if I wished to act contrary to his advice I should have to arrange for other counsel to appear on my behalf. The Menzies and Fadden administrations were legally represented before the commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Villeneuve - or villainous; I am not certain of the correct pronunciation - Smith. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry</inline> raised the point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Villeneuve</inline> Smith whether or not he wished to make any comment. The right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was present. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> conferred with him, and then said to the commissioner, ##"##I am advised not to offer any objection ##"##. Why did the honorable member for Fawkner not quote thatportion of the commissioner##'##s report? </para>

In order that honorable members may not believe that I am making charges that cannot be substantiated it is necessary that I cite my authorities as to the state of the defences when Labour took office. According to the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> of the 9th September, 1942, the Minister for Health and Home Affairs in the Queensland Government pointed out in the State Legislative Assembly on the 6th May, 1939, that there was no anti-aircraft defence in North Australia, and that again and again the Queensland Government had asked the Commonwealth for an air base in the northern part of the State, hut the invariable reply had been that the work did not justify the expense. That was when the anti-Labour forces were in control. The work did not justify the expense! The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> said in the House of Representatives on the 24th lune, 1943 - in the electorate that I represent there were aerodromes, if they can be so described, mi which even a small Douglas machine could no.t land and from which it could not take off. Aeroplanes were compelled to pass daily over a number of towns, because of the lack of accommodation on the aerodrome and the shortness of the runway. </para>

                        <para>I propose now to give to the House some particulars regarding the appalling position of Australia##'##s defences when this Government took office. There was not one modern lighter  aeroplane  in the Commonwealth. You could count on one hand the number of tanks we had when the Menzies Government was in office. We had only about fifteen rounds of anti-tank ammunition per gun. We had less than one week##'##s supply of field artillery ammunition for fighting on a very moderate scale. We had only about (5u per cent, of the rifles required to equip our forces. We had only about 20 per cent, of the number of light, automatic tommy guns required and there was a very serious shortage of the machine guns we needed, with hopelessly inadequate supplies of spare parts. We had had in this country for many years a large number of .31 calibre rifles, but when we took office there was no ammunition whatever in Australia for them. The last Government stood idly by and watched our petrol reserves dwindling from week to week until, when this Government took office, they had reached a perilously low level. There were no aerial torpedo bombs. There was only one radiodirectional finding equipment .set. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted. \</inline></para>

If honorable gentlemen opposite want any further authority, I will quote the statement made by General Douglas MacArthur on the anniversary of his arrival in Australia.

General Douglas MacArthur knew about it, because he was the first to use the term ##"##Brisbane line##"##.

I shall, before concluding, give some facts to show that the Opposition has. not. disposed of the pointsI raised when I spoke them. The honorable member for Fawkner said that dates were important. I shall give him some.. In October, 1941, Labour took office. In March, 1942, </para>

                    <para>In October, 1942, I first publicly made my charges. In October, 1942, the  Tight  honorable member for Kooyong and the  Tight  honorable member for North Sydney .denied the charges. They said there was no basis for them and that i hey weise figments of ray imagination. On##'## the 17th March, 1943, General MacArthur##'##s statement was published in the Australian press. </para>
                    <para>If the Leader if .the Opposition knew  of ##'##Our  defenceless state and heard for the first time on the 4th February, 1942, of the existence of ##"## the .Brisbane line ##"##, why .did he deny in October, 1942, that there was any base for the charges I have made? He said then that the charges were a figment of my imagination. Honorable members opposite were daily appealing to the Prime Minister. ##'##They wanted Ward shut up and prevented from making the charges which were proving very damaging to them in the electorate. In order to divert attention from the real charges to something that was of relatively less importance, they demanded a royal commission. They had it. It proved as abortive as I predicted it would. I said that it would not clear up this matter, and. it did not. Even after  the  report became known, t##'##hey said, ##"## This does not dispose of it. The questions have not .been answered. The Royal Commissioner was unable to conclude his inquiry, and therefore the matter is one for the Parliament.##'####"## Although the Royal .Commissioner##'##s  report  found absolutely nothing in regard  to  the charges that I made, honorable members opposite still demanded the continuance of .my suspension. The Prime Minister agreed that the Opposition might desire .an inquiry for the purpose of finding out whether there was any basis for my charges. So I remained in ##'##suspension. Then, in August, T  was  returned to the House of Representatives with a record majority, and  later  my ##'##colleagues expressed their confidence in me by restoring me *o Cabinet. But members of the Opposition are still dissatisfied. They contend that the matter has not been disposed of, .and .demand to know what the (Government proposes to do. Their lack of sincerity is indicated by the Ea-ct that  only  six members of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> United Australia party, and most of them junior members, are listening to this debate. All the prominent members  of  the United Australia party have ##"##gome into smoke ##"##, because they were afraid to face  a  thorough debate of my charges. </para>
                    <para>Tire Royal Commissioner found nothing. He was obliged to come to the finding that he did. I was never afraid of a proper inquiry into  nay  charges, amS the majority of the Australian people are quite satisfied that the greatest tragedy which could have befallen this country would have been the return to office of the bunglers -and ##"##worse, who comprised ##'##the anti-Labour Government. As the <inline font-style="italic">Baily Telegraph</inline> said, the  Labour  Government started from behind scratch. When the Curtin Government took office Australia had been at war for two years, but the Labour party required only a relatively short period in which to put the defences of the country in such a healthy condition that the Prime Minister was able to announce on behalf of the Government that the threat to this -continent had passed. I am now completely satisfied that the charges which I .made against the Menzies-Eadden Administration have been fully justified by the revelation  of  the facts. </para>

                    <para>I propose to examine the defence position of Australia, and to remind ##"##FieldMarshal##"## Ward of a few things that he has said in the past. No doubt the Minister desires to be promoted to the rank to which the leader of the Russians elevated himself not long ago. I recommend to honorable members a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Day of the Saxon.</inline> I have not read it for twenty years, but the Parliamentary Library has a copy of it. Published in 1910, the book contains maps of Australia and of the Pacific generally, and honorable members will find clearly laid down in those pages by one of the greatest military minds that the United States of America has produced, the areas that Australia would be able to defend in the event of a war with Japan. For nearly nine years, I have been a member of this chamber and in that period I have heard many debates on external affairs and the defence of Australia. Often I have heard the Minister declare that defensive preparations in Australia were not necessary.  His  colleague, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> even after this war ##'##broke out, asked, ##"##Who is this enemy against which the Government proposes to defend Australia? ##"## In 1937, the Lyons Government decided to increase the Militia forces from 35,000 to 70,000 men. I challenge any honorable member opposite, and I include the new vintage, to say that he assisted the Lyons Government in that matter. </para>

                            <para>- There is everything wrong with it. The point which I make is that the Lyons Government received scant assistance from the Australian Labour party in its efforts to strengthen the defences of Australia. When hostilities began in 1939, the Labour party declared the struggle to .be a capitalist or imperialist war. When, in December, 1939, the Prime Minister of the day <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> sought from Parliament authority to despatch units of the Australian Imperial Force overseas, every member of the Australian Labour party opposed the motion. Worse still, when the then Minister for the Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Street,</inline> introduced a bill to empower the Government to employ units of the Militia in Papua, New Guinea and the islands, which are now in the tender care of the Minister for Transport and External Territories, the honorable gentleman opposed the measure in one of the most vigorous speeches that I have ever heard him make. If he will refer to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he will see that his words were in this strain : ##"## If New Guinea and Papua have to be defended at all, they should be defended by the people who are foolish enough to live there. It is none of my business ##"##. </para>

                    <para>Before the outbreak of war, the  Menzies  Government decided to compile a register of man-power, and the Labour party prevailed upon the right honorable gentleman to delete from the bill the provision that empowered the authorities to seek from each male person information regarding his military service. Instead of talking about having defended Australia, the Minister is one of the last men who should refer to the subject. He has done absolutely nothing to support even the most elementary defence precautions. He has only attempted to divide the country on ##"## the Brisbane  line ##"## controversy. On various occasions I have assisted in the preparation of certain plans. Although I have not worked on ##"## the Brisbane line ##"## plan, I have no doubt that two or three different lines have been proposed .for the defence of Brisbane. I am sure that there is a line for the defence of Townsville, and other lines for the defence of Coffs Harbour, Port Stephens, Newcastle, Sydney, and Port Kembla. I know personally something about the plans for the defence of the southern parts of this continent. For instance, there are plans for the defence of Melbourne from attack from either the east or the west. It may surprise the Minister to learn that I was associated on one occasion with the preparation of plans for the defence of Adelaide. Therefore, on his reasoning, if it be reasoning- </para>

                            <para>- We should study carefully this rather momentous piece of political jugglery known as ##"## the Brisbane line ##"##. The Minister for Transport was at great pains this morning to quote the views of a great number of people on the subject. Among others, he quoted the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> a Minister of the Government of Queensland. I have just met that honorable gentleman, and I have come to the conclusion that he is not at all a dangerous man. The Minister also used the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DwyerGray,</inline> the Treasurer of Tasmania. I know him moderately well. He has never struck me as a gentleman who knows very much about military problems in Australia or elsewhere. If he had to conduct military operations I believe the weapons would be feather dusters. I was not impressed by the remarks of the Minister in that regard. I do not wish to speak at great length on this subject, for some honorable members much more important than I may want to say something on it. Not one authority mentioned by the Minister this morning could be considered, by any stretch of the imagination, as being qualified to express a weighty opinion on this subject. So far as I know, the Minister himself was the first person to make a reference to ##"## the Brisbane line ##"##. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry that the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> has mentioned General MacArthur##'##s name. It is unfortunate that he has done so. I have an effective reply to the honorable member##'##s interjection if I choose to use it. As one who has some understanding of military matters, I would say to the honorable member for Bass, who always becomes vocal on Friday afternoons, that I, also, have some knowledge of international relations and the customs and courtesies inevitably linked with the successful conduct of international affairs. For that reason, I regret that the Minister for Transport imported into this debate the name of any person who is not one of our own citizens. Some time after the Minister had first mentioned ##"## the Brisbane line ##"## in the kindly and friendly way for which he is so distinguished., he reiteratedhis statements.The right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> who was then Leader of the Opposition, quite rightly took violent exception - well, perhaps not violent exception, but exception - to the statements of the Minister, and insisted that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Curtin)</inline> should clarify the position, because if the right honorable member for Darling Downs and certain other honorable gentlemen who now sit on this side of the House are guilty of the things that were charged against them before the elections, and that have been charged against them again this morning in a most emphatic and violent way, theyshould be impeached for what could only be fittingly described as treason. Certainly, the conduct alleged against them amounts to criminal negligence. From his place at the table in this House, not long before the elections, in the presence of myself and a number of his henchmenthe Prime Minister in his wisdom - and he has quite a lot of political wisdom - repudiated everything that the then Minister for Labourand National Service had said. So strong were the Prime Minister##'##s convictions on that occasion that he suspended the Minister, who thereupon took a seat on. the back bench beside the honorable member for Melbourne {Mr. Calwell). The question of an inquirythen arose. I am not one of the legal gentry of this place, but I well remember discussing the subject with the then honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn).</inline> As soon as the question was raised I naturally took it for granted that leading King##'##s Counsel who, at times, adorn the benches on this side of the chamber, would have taken into consideration the effect that parliamentary privilege would have on this issue. Any honorable gentleman who gave thought to the subject at that timeshould have recognized that that issue was likely to arise. I do not desire to : say very much about the inquiry. </para>

Onrural subjects I am always ready to talk ##"## turkey ##"##, though I do not wish to mix the flavours. Toe honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> was,in my view, entitled to advance that argument. I take the opportunity to say that he put the case  very  well this morning from the Opposition point of view, but we have to recognize that it is not what the honorable member for Fawkner or I think; it is what the royal  commission  has done. That is the all-important thing. The next most important thing is the action of the Prime Minister after the royal commission had reported to the Governor-General. At that time the Prime Minister said publicly that the then Minister for Labour and National Service would remain under suspension until Parliament had met and dealt with him. That is the crux and kernel of the whole question, and, in my opinion, it was not the Minister forTransport but the Prime Minister who should have answered at the table this morning. That responsibility is now more weighty and deadly than ever, seeing that the Minister forTransport reiterated  hischarges  this morning. . Are we to accept the statements of the Minister for Transport or those of the Prime Minister? Are we to accept the view that in order to deceive Japan, the Prime Minister had to put up  a  bluff or a smoke screen? This morning the Minister for Transport conveyed the impression to the House, on behalf of the Prime Minister, that because of the fine political balance in this chamber before the elections the Prime Minister, in a Machiavellian sort of way, was entitled to tell honorable members and the country  that  if theroyal commission reported in a certain way he would do something which he did not really intend to do. </para>

                        <para>We, as an Opposition, are opposed to the principle of incubating private vested interests in Australia in connexion with the defence needs. Under the old feudal system,, in return for certain baronial rights which the King gave to his favorites, those favorites undertook to raise armies onhis behalf. We can say that that was a period in which defence was established on the basis of private enterprise.

                            <para>- I am quite prepared to stand up to anything that I have said. Long before the war occurred, as far back as 1935, I informed this House that the next time a world war occurred and we had France as an ally, France would let us down and crash. Men who were very friendly to me at that time took violent exception to my remarks. If honorable gentlemen opposite care to examine the volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they will find also that long. before this war occurred I prophesied the boundaries in which a second Australian Imperial Force would serve. I said that they would lie well within the Cape, Cairo and New Zealand. Our Australian Imperial Force has not yet shifted beyond those boundaries. I said, too, on that occasion that a second Australian Imperial Force would never fight in France. No doubt some honorable gentlemen who were then sitting opposite me said things, though not quite loud enough for me to hear them ! </para>

                            <para>- What I said about Russia is well known, and I do not qualify one word of it. I say now to honorable gentlemen that, in any peace negotiations, Russia will be firm in regard to its frontiers in Western Europe. I am quite sure that Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Esthonia will not be able to make any representations against the aggressive, imperialistic republic which has its seat of government in Moscow. Only a few days ago, a Newcastle newspaper published the information that seven of ten American bombers that were missing from a raid on Paraninshur in the Kurile Islands had escaped in the wrong direction and landed on Russian soil. Their crews were interned, as were other American crews after the raid on Tokyo. Honorable gentlemen opposite would be well advised to have little to say about Russia for some time to come, because big moves are ahead and big contests are going on behind the scenes, of which, I presume, they know nothing and, I feel sure, would understand less if they were told anything about them. All that I had to say in regard to Russia in August, 1941, still stands; there is nothing that I have yet to qualify. At the moment, however, we are on ##"## the Brisbane line ##"##. </para>

                            <para>- Doubtless a translation would benefit my honorable friend, who has in him a strain of the same nationality, which displays itself on numerous occasions. My electors were told in most emphatic language, pictorially and in other ways, ##"## These two men saved Australia ##"##. Listening to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> this morning, one would think he had done it almost off his own bat. I expect him to come here one of these days with a motion declaring that he was responsible for digging the river Murray channel and Sydney Harbour. He would require parliamentary approval of that statement; and no doubt, with the House as at present constituted, he would get it without much debate. In the matter of the salvation of this country, I quite frankly allow a little to Providence and a little to the mistakes of human enemies. Honorable gentlemen opposite must recognize that whatever measure of salvation we have achieved has been due to the introduction into this country of the conscript forces of other countries, to back up our own Militia forces. </para>

                            <para>- Among the warring nations generally, practically only conscripts are fighting to-day. The Dutch forces, the Free French, the British forces, the American forces, the New Zealand forces - every man jack of them in Australia is a conscript. If the voluntary principle be involved, let me say that I went through the first World War as a volunteer, and that I have been a volunteer for the last sixteen years. I volunteered for the second Australian Imperial Force, but the powers that be would not let me leave Australia, doubtless because they held the view that I would be missed too greatly by my friends opposite and there would be casualties among them due to heart failure, whilst others would die of remorse. I put this to those honorable members opposite who have been such unqualified champions of the voluntary principle when it did not look as though volunteers would be needed: At the outbreak of the war, the volunteers had thundering little for which to thank the Commonwealth </para>

                            <para>- If that can be said of this country at the outbreak of the war with Japan, let me tell the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Breen)</inline> that I was partly responsible for it. After the evacuation of Dunkirk, the Menzies Government, of which I was a member, packed up guns, ammunition and everything else that could be spared, and sent it to the defence of the United Kingdom. I dare any man in the Labour party - I would dare even the devil himself - to say that we were wrong. In the history of the British race, there never was a grander moment than that which followed the evacuation of Dunkirk. Had Winston Churchill been brought out here during the last three or four years, he would have been condemned as a nitwit in this Parliament, the simple reason being that* Winston Churchill, like certain men in this Parliament, in his day and generation was fool enough to go on active service. For too long throughout this war, in parliamentary and political circles, has active service and a knowledge of his subject by any member of this Parliament been regarded as a disqualification. <inline font-style="italic">{Extension of time granted.##]##</inline></para>

                            <para>- My capacity to hold my tongue on matters that ought to be kept secret will bear comparison with that of any honorable member of this House. Perhaps I am guilty of having said in this chamber, even during the course of this debate to-day, what not many other honorable members would say. It seems to be the view of too many honorable members that the great body of our fellow citizens, who have not graced and adorned these green benches, do not understand what is happening here. Most of us are average men, and realize that the generality of mankind is not altogether foolish, but can judge the motives of other men. When putting out a smoke-screen, do not run away with the idea that the people outside are not ##'##able to judge what is happening behind it. They may not be able to detail happenings. They may not be able to lay a finger on this one and that one, and say that he has done this, that or the other; nevertheless they are keenly conscious of what is going on. The statement of Abraham Lincoln that ##"##you cannot fool all the people all the time ##"## still holds good. </para>

Some day, when I shall still be here, my distinguished friend from Griffith will be once more working somewhere in the neighbourhood of ##"##.the Brisbane line ##"##.

No member opposite other than the Minister for Transport, would do that, and none has attempted to do it. I hope that there will be some clarification of the position by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> Perhaps, having gained the most remarkable victory ever achieved by any leader at an election in Australia, he considers that matters of this sort are beneath his notice.

I am a plain, man, in method as well as in looks. ##'## \ believe that the only fair and honest way is to choose your objective, and go towards it. I have no time for the political manoeuvring which seems to delight the hearts of some of my Machiavellian friends, but which usually gets them into a position where they can go neither forwards nor backwards. I regret that this matter was ever intruded into our public life. One day, the issue will be tried before the tribunal of history. The record may not be written for a while yet. but eventually all the relevant documents will be brought to light. Some day men will sit down, dispassionately and write the truth about ##"## the Brisbane line ##"##. When that day comes, I have no doubt that the reputation of the man who originated, the controversy will be described by a word of three letters - mud. </para>

The matter is now before the House, because, I understand,, the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> to move that the report of the royal commission be printed, thus affording an opportunity  for it to be debated. Therefore, as one whose name has been associated with this unsavoury matter, I am naturally disappointed to find to-day, when it is called on for debate, that only six or seven members of the Opposition are in their places. The public can be excused for not treating the matter with the seriousness it deserves when some of those directly concerned in the allegations evince so little interest. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> compliment the honorable member for Fawkner upon hisspeech. He possesses qualifications which should have received greater recognition from members of his own party on a recent occasion. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. Nothing has happened since the writing of that latter to justify the Prime Minister in lifting the suspension. I repeat that it is regrettable that the Opposition has not taken more seriously its position as the watchdog of the people. I recall that the Leader of the Opposition said only a little while ago that what the Opposition lacked in numbers it would make up in the vigour of its debating. Obviously, he said, because of its numerical weakness, the Opposition could not ensure that its policy would be implemented. It would have to depend on vigorous debate to rouse the -Government to an appreciation of its point of view. As a matter of fact, this is not a party matter - it concerns the Parliament as a whole. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Transport, capable debater that he is, skillfully evaded the real issue. He brought the fight to our corner withhis allegations that Australia was defenceless at the time the Labour Government assumed office. He has placed on record many statements in support of his case, and so I can he excused for quoting from speeches and statements in order to show what was the defence policy of the previous administration, and what was the attitude of responsible members of ##'##the present Government to proposals for strengthening Australia##'##s defences. The Minister for Transport said that the defences of Australia were in a deplorable condition when the Labour party assumed office on the 7th October, 1941. At the time of the election in 1940, the war had been in progress for twelve months. It broke out in September, 1939, and Australia, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, automatically became a belligerent. Our Government went to the country in 1940 with a twelve months##'## record of war administration, and the people gave us a mandate to carry on, and confirmed our defence policy. Admittedly, the mandate was not a very effective one. Because of- the relative strength of the parties, it was difficult to make of Parliament an effective instrument for legislation. ##"##What happened? En October, 1940, by arrangement with the then Opposition, we formed the Advisory War Council on which the Government and the Opposition had equal representation with four members each. The Labour party##'##s representatives were the Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> the present Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> and the present Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> Something akin to an all-party government to conduct the supreme direction of the war was set up within a month of the 1940 general elections. </para>

                            <para>- It was set up to consider and give advice upon all defence matters - matters involving the strategic direction of the war. The Labour party representatives were most active. They attended meetings of the council armed with volumes of advice and complaints and the results of their inspection of munitions factories and annexes. Were the Labour party representatives dissatisfied ? Did they think that Australia was in a defenceless position? Did they believe that our policy was to throw Australia, particularly Queensland, to the wolves? If the answer to those questions is ##"## Yes ##"##, they failed in their duty to their party and to the people as a whole by remaining silent and by remaining members of the council. But the answer is not ##"## Yes ##"## ; it is a decided negative. They were so satisfied with the condition of Australia that their leader asked me when I was Acting Prime Minister during the absence abroad of the right honorable member for Kooyong, to increase the membership of the council, which I readily consented to do. The right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was added from the Labour party##'##s side, and the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> from our side, so preserving the balance. If all the claims made to-day by the Minister for Transport were true and Australia was in an utterly defenceless position when Labour took office, instead of asking for the appointment of the right honorable member for Barton to the council, the right honorable member for Fremantle and his colleagues should have resigned and protested to Parliament and the country that the then Government was not doing the right thing by Australia. A further _ denial of the charges made by the Minister for Transport is contained in a statement made by the right honorable member for Fremantle on the 18th October, 1941, only eleven days after he became Prime Minister. The Minister for Transport to-day admitted that the Prime Minister had made the statement, but offered as an excuse that it was necessary to bluff the Japanese. </para>

                    <para>After Labour took office, the Advisory War Council was not only continued, but also expanded and given enlarged powers. Therefore, the claim by the Minister for Transport that the Menzies and Fadden administrations had no regard for the need to defend Australia is completely refuted. But in case some honorable members yet remain to be convinced, I produce further evidence of the falsity of the allegations made by the Minister for Transport.

                        <para>Before this war, Australia had not even built a motor car. But when Australia came in she had already supplied a wide range of war equipment to allied countries, including Great Britain, Egypt, South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji, the Netherlands East Indies, Hong Kong, Malta, Malaya, Burma, India and the Fighting French in the Pacific. </para>

                    <para class="block">Who supplied that equipment - this Government or that which preceded it? Will any responsible##'## member of this House doubt that it was our Government that, by its acceptance of the global strategy, enabled this country, when it was threatened with invasion, to claim and receive strong aid from its Allies, notably the United States of America? The isolationist policy which would have been applied in this country had the Labour party occupied the treasury bench in September, 1939, when war broke out, would have disqualified us from ever being able to ask for, let alone receive, the aid which has conferred on Australia its present degree of safety. Australia became entitled to the aid it received because it raised, equipped and despatched overseas the Australian Imperial Force, men of the Royal Australian Air Force, ships and men of the Royal Australian Navy, and stripped itself of armaments in order to help Great Britain when it stood with its back to the wall after the withdrawal from Dunkirk. We paid for our right to ask for help in the battle to retain our title to this country. That aid came. It included American conscripts, men enlisted to serve wherever sent - a contrast with the limitations of service we have placed on our conscripts. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for Transport and External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> who has spoken in his own defence, has endeavoured to obscure the three simple points at issue in this matter. The first is the important question of parliamentary privilege, the second concorns a matter of opinion or political judgment.,, and the third relates, to a matter of fact. On the question of parliamentary privilege, the House was. entitled to a declaration by the Prime Minister early  in the debate regarding the position of the Minister whom he suspended. He made a definite statement when that gentleman had appealed -through his barrister for the maintenance of his privileges as a member of Parliament. He said that the Parliament should be the judge in this matter, and added that, in the meantime, the honorable member would be suspended from his ministerial duties. Yet before the Parliament has dealt with the matter, the Minister is again in his place, and is actively carrying out his functions as a Minister. The whole subject of parlia mentary privilege is also involved in another aspect. It would- be intolerable, indeed, if an honorable member should be able to make statements in this Parliament regarding matters or persons without regard to the interests of people outfide who might desire an inquiry into the truth of the. statements. This matter of resting behind parliamentary privilege should not be dealt with in the off-hand manner  which  the Government is adopting. We are entitled to a statement by the Prime Minister before the debate is concluded. As the Leader of the  House  he must guard its traditions. I consider that it should have been made at the beginning of the debate. The other two matters raised are of vital importance, and they should have been dealt with by .the head of the Government, and not by the Minister who has spoken. What will be the position if, as soon as an inquiry is desired as to the truth of certain statements, the sittings of the House are brought to a conclusion? In this particular instance. F am discussing a political issue which could be determined by the electors. Apparently they have given -a verdict tip on. it and I do not cavil at it, but I am concerned about the preservation of the privileges of this Parliament and about the redress of just grievances of individuals. From the first meeting of the British Parliament the practice has been, and the Standing Orders have been framed accordingly, to ensure freedom of debate, so that any legitimate grievance may be ventilated. A definite obligation rests on the Parliament to ensure a fair deal to the public. I am gravely concerned at the off-hand way in which this matter has been treated at a time when the whole of the members of the Opposition are not in attendance. So much for the question of privilege. </para>

                    <para>The matter of opinion that remains to be decided is whether the retention in the Cabinet of a Minister, who has practically given to the Prime Minister and to his colleagues the lie direct and <inline font-style="italic">ih&lt;##&gt;##</inline> lie indirect, will lead to a negation of responsible government and the destruction of Cabinet authority. For 240 years, parliaments have been building up the tradition of Cabinet responsibility with regard to the control of the Executive. Having done so much in that  direction we should be most careful that we do not break down that principle. The electors of East Sydney and a majority of the Labour caucus have expressed the opinion that the retention of a Minister in the circumstances to which I have referred is not a negation of responsible government.I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot allow this motion to be agreed to without protest. I am mindful of other days, when the country was already at war, and when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> as Leader of the Opposition, was most emphatic as to the necessity for a monthly meeting of the House of Representatives. I recall that later, on a Friday morning he agreed on behalf of the Government to a proposal to that effect. During the last Parliament the general practice, when an adjournment of the nature now proposed was granted, was to place a maximum, time limit on the power of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to keep the House in recess. As the present motion is worded there is no such time limit. It has been customary in times gone by for the Minister submitting such a motion to acquaint the House of the maximum period for which he proposed that the House should remain in recess. </para>

                        <para>- I look upon that as a <inline font-style="italic">long</inline> recess. When the new regulations with regard to coal are promulgated, and the citizens of Sydney are told that they cannot have so many tram-cars as in the past to take them to the beaches, there will probably be some interesting developments. I agree wholeheartedly with what the Prime Minister said from the Opposition benches over three and a half years ago, when he declared that in time of war it was the duty of the Parliament to keep a close watch on the actions of the Executive. For all the information we have received during the present sittings regarding the intentions of the Government, this Parliament need not have met at all. We are no better informed to-day regarding what is in the air than we were when we adjourned last June. In view of the present position with regard to the coal-mining industry, and bearing in mind other developments that may occur, it is of the utmost importance to place a time limit upon the period for which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> are to be permitted to keep the House in recess. To-day is the 15th of October, and there is still a period of over two months to Christmas. A lot of Cabinet work can be done in a month if Ministers concentrate on their work and are of one mind and heart. The suggestion that a long time is required for the preparation of legislation leads me to believe that things may not be just what they seem. </para>

                <para>My. FADDEN  (Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) ##[##3.41##]##.  -  The Australian Country party is of the opinion that the Parliament should not go into recess for any long period. Many important problems, both internal and external confront us, and the representatives of the people should be kept in close touch with what is happening in the world. </para>
                <para class="block">The only means by which that can he clone is for the Parliament to meet frequently with as short recesses as possible. I have no desire to embarrass the Government in its administration, because I have some appreciation of the difficulties with which it is faced. It has just come back from the electors and must have time to prepare its legislative programme. However, having regard to the gravity of world conditions, I urge that every opportunity be given to the representatives of the people to meet so that they may be kept in touch with developments in international affairs. The Opposition wishes to co-operate with the Government in assisting to solve the problems facing this country by meeting as frequently as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I agree with the views which have been expressed. I would have put in the motion a date limiting the period for which the Parliament should remain in recess but for the dangers inherent in such a motion; we may fix a date a week or a fortnight too early. The statement that I made yesterday in relation to the coal-mining industry relates to a matter concerning which the Parliament is entitled to explanations should the Government##'##s proposals not be productive of good results. I say that frankly. I shall ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to summon the Parliament immediately the Cabinet is in a position to place legislation before it, or, in the event of some development, either within or outside Australia, which would of itself provide adequate justification for our assembling here. I do not know what period will be required to prepare the legislative programme for our next sittings, nor do I know the nature of all the legislation that will then be brought forward. Some of it will be of a highly technical character and may take longer to prepare than we expect. </para>

                    <para>.- On the 13th October, 1943, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> asked me a question relating to the <inline font-style="italic">Digest of Decisions and Announcements.</inline> This publication was commenced by the present Government in October, 1941, and is issued on the authority of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> The purpose of the publication is to provide honorable members and members of the Senate, Commonwealth and State departments, the press, and a large number of organizations in Australia, with an authentic and factual digest of decisions and announcements made by the Commonwealth Government. It is also distributed overseas; where it has been found to be of great value to our representatives in other countries. I believe that the majority of honorable members find this publication of value in their work, and only to-day the honorable member for Fawkner himself quoted extensively from it during the debate on ##"##the Brisbane line ##"##. Issue No. 62 of the <inline font-style="italic">Digest</inline> did contain the verbatim text of the Prime Minister##'##s policy speech at the general election. It was included because it was thought desirable that it should be permanently on record. That issue was not published until after polling day. </para>

                        <para>- The answers to the honarable member##'##s questions are as follows :: -  1 and 2. No moneys have yet been paid. Thecircumstancesare that about six  week? ago, the owner ceased operations at this mine, and intimated that he would not re-open unless he received an increased price of approximately 3s.6d. a ton. The Coal Commission directed that the mine be immediately re-opened, and simultaneously gave an undertaking that it would investigate the finances of the mine and pay such subsidy as was reasonably justified. This undertaking was limited to a period of six weeks, as in that time it was thought that a complete investigation would be concluded. It was found, however, that no proper books of account were kept, and consequently the investigation was more prolonged than anticipated. A report, which will be referred to the Prices Stabilization Committee, is now being made to the Commission. </para>

                            <para>Implementation of the recommendations referred to would require the expenditure of capital in addition to the subsidy found to be payable. The fact is that the mine is not an economical producer. It employs 24 men for an output of 20 tons per day, and the Commission feels that it would not be justified in spending Commonwealth funds on its further development- at least until a boring programme which has now been undertaken on this field by the Victorian Mines Department, has been concluded. </para>

                        <para>y. -  On the 7th October a question, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> was asked by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> of , the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in relation to the Women##'##s Land Army. It must he pointed out; that- the Australian Women##'##s Land Army is not an enlisted service as are the Women##'##s Auxiliary Australian Air Force and the Australian Women##'##s Army Service, the Australian Army Medical Women##'##s Service and the Women##'##s Royal Australian Naval Service, and therefore has not been, granted exactly the same privileges, as have been accorded to the services. Cabinet did approve of the Women##'##s Land Army being granted a status akin to that, of the women##'##s service auxiliaries, and pursuant to this decision similar privileges have been granted as far as possible. For example, members of the Women##'##s Land Army are granted free railway travel to their homes for the purpose of enjoying their paid annual holiday leave of twelve working days. The question of extending travel concessions to enable members of the Land Army to visit their homes more frequently is at present under consideration by the Director-General of Land Transport. Members of the Women##'##s Land Army are also admitted to a number of clubs and hostels on equal footing with members of the women##'##s service auxiliaries. Recently the uniform and clothing issue has been increased, so that to-day the issue compares very favorably with that made to members of the services. The question of granting special post and telegraph concessions was taken up with the Postmaster-General##'##s Department. However, there are certain, technical difficulties in the way of granting such concessions, as correspondence to members of the Land Army would be addressed to private addresses and there could ##'##be no suitable check on .correspondence sent by members. Moreover, it was considered that if post and telegraph concessions were granted to members of the Land Army similar claims would probably be made by other nonservice organizations, such as* the Civil Constructional Corps. </para>
