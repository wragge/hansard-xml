<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I informed the House that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's broadcast of proceedings would be relayed into members' rooms for two days by means of the House monitoring system. Some of the commercial broadcasting organisations which make use of the House monitoring system to enable the recording of excerpts of proceedings have advised that the procedure adopted yesterday has made this task difficult. Consequently, the House monitoring system will today carry a clean feed of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) raised a matter of privilege in connection with an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 November relating to the report of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. The article in question purports to reveal a knowledge of recommendations of and argument by the Select Committee, the report of which has since been presented to the House. Standing order 340 provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The evidence taken by any Select Committee of the House and documents presented to and proceedings and reports of such Committee, which have not been reported to the House, shall not, unless authorized by the House, be disclosed or published by any Member of such Committee, or by any other person.</PARA>
<PARA> It has long been held that the publication or disclosure of reports prior to their presentation to the House constitutes a breach of privilege or contempt-I refer to House of Representatives Practice pages 660-1 and to May, 20th edition, pages 153-4.</PARA>
<PARA> On its face, the report gives the impression that the author had prior knowledge of recommendations of the Committee. It is quite impossible, however, for me to reach any conclusion on whether or not this was the case, nor would it be proper for me to do so. I am required rather to decide whether, on the information available to me, there is prima facie evidence of a breach of privilege or contempt.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the newspaper report was published and the matter raised by the honourable member, the report of the Committee has been tabled in the House. However, the fact of the tabling does not alter the gravamen of the complaint raised by the honourable member. Having considered the complaint and the newspaper report, I am prepared to allow precedence to a motion in respect of the matter if the House wishes to proceed further.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Speaker, I do not intend to move a motion to have this matter referred to the Privileges Committee. However, I think I should take the opportunity to remind all members of the House that in fact it is a breach of privilege and it is also irresponsible of members of any committee, whether it be the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise or any other parliamentary committee, to disclose information that may be contained in a parliamentary report before it is tabled in this House. I think it is also opportune to remind members of the Press that it is also a breach of privilege on their part to publish any matter contained in a parliamentary report before it is tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case undue concern may well have been raised among residents living adjacent to Sydney Airport about relaxation of curfews in that area. A proper reading of the report may have dispelled concerns that may have been raised by those residents. I do not intend to pursue this matter any further, but all members of the House and all members of the Press Gallery should be reminded of the fact that early or premature disclosure before reports are tabled is a breach of privilege and also grossly irresponsible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is along the lines of that raised by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr). In this morning's Press, specifically the Australian and the Age, articles deal with the forthcoming tabling of the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Mr Speaker, you will be aware that that report has not yet been tabled, yet those articles seek to deal with its purported recommendations. Both articles quote from Government sources. If, as the articles allege, the origin of tension between the parliamentary committee overseeing the National Crime Authority and that body is a lack of trust on the part of the National Crime Authority, any suggestion that a Government member has canvassed this matter with the media prior to the tabling of the report in this Parliament is of the utmost seriousness. The matter of privilege is that these newspaper articles have dealt at length with recommendations contained in the report and that the source of that information is quoted in both articles as being Government members.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Canberra Mail Centre, Fyshwick.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia Post requires new accommodation for the Canberra Mail Centre to unite mail handling and vehicle operations on one site. The new buildings will be located at Canberra Avenue, Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory. The proposal involves the construction of a single storey mail processing area, with a three-storey section accommodating administration, amenities and plant. A detached single storey building will be provided as a motor vehicle service centre. Hardstanding will be provided to cater for mail vehicles and parking for staff and visitors. The proposed work will cost $7.52m at August 1985 prices.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the Public Works Committee for its prompt consideration of the proposal. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA> Audit can find no authoritative material in the Department that could be used as a reference for officers making decisions in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Department, in its construction of the Canberra Mail Centre, can do no better than that we are going to have trouble. We also ask the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr West) to avoid another situation such as that which occurred at Rushcutters Bay with the infamous all-on overtime procedures. This audit report also says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Audit suggested that a tighter accountability and more formalised controls over variations should be introduced in the interests of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>If the Department of Housing and Construction arranges the construction of the Canberra Mail Centre in that fashion it will be a disaster. The report also says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill proposes assistance by way of subsidy on the manufacture of grain harvesters and parts which, if imported, would be classisfied to item 84.25.9 of the Customs tariff. The proposal is for a two-part subsidy scheme: Firstly, a subsidy at a rate of 12.5 per cent of ex-factory selling prices where the registered producers of complete machines whose value added in production is not less than 40 per cent of ex-factory selling prices and, secondly, a subsidy at 25 per cent of value added for another manufacturer of grain harvesters and parts classified to sub-item 84.25.9 of the Customs tariff. These arrangements, which arise out of the Industries Assistance Commission's findings, provide for assistance equivalent to a 15 per cent tariff. The two-part scheme is to ensure that no manufacturer will be disadvantaged under the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subsidy, which was originally to be effective from 1 January 1986, will now be payable from 21 August 1985. The alteration to the effective date arises as a result of the November selling season. Failure to implement the proposal prior to the selling season would have disadvantaged local manufacturers and grain growers. The alteration to the date has also necessitated a special subsidy on those goods cleared for home consumption before 21 August and sold on or after that date. This has particular application to the South Australian company, Horwood Bagshaw Ltd. In a telex that company stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985 in its present form substantially disadvantages Horwood Bagshaw's local manufacturing activities in this regard because the proposed bounty level for more than half its planned 1985-86 production will be substantially less than the assistance presently provided by way of tariff.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in conflict with the statement. The telex continues:</PARA>
<PARA> For example, Horwood Bagshaw is the sole local producer of self-propelled harvesters i.e. HB model 2140 SP.</PARA>
<PARA> Under section 13 of the proposed Bill, Horwood Bagshaw's production of this machine, which represents approximately 50 per cent total production in 1985-86, would not qualify as it has insufficient value added as defined by section 7. A similar situation may exist in relation to our model HB 2141 PTO.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the original terms of the IAC's recommendations, Horwood Bagshaw could have expected to receive $6,554 for the production of our SP2140 machine.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now proposes that this should be only $4,946, based on 25 per cent of value added . . . because the machine does not incorporate a minimum of 40 per cent value added.</PARA>
<PARA> Should Horwood Bagshaw's SP2140 machine be assisted by the provisions of section 13 . . . and not section 14, then it could have expected to receive $8,630 per machine. This would then have been in line with the average duty paid on imported machines during 1985.</PARA>
<PARA>Complementary to this Bill is provision for duty free entry of goods classified to 84.25.9. Presumably, legislation will be introduced to implement this change in due course.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the House why this Bill is necessary. In 1983 the Government introduced a 15 per cent tariff on imported grain harvesters. These imports supply about 70 per cent of the market. The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation submitted to the Government that this duty would add costs to grain growers of about $14m per year. The Government requested the IAC to examine the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation's submission. The IAC reasserted its view that a 15 per cent tariff was the approriate form of assistance. The Government accepted this advice. However, following pressure from the Opposition and the rural community, the Government in its second Budget announced that it would remove this duty and replace it with a bounty. This Bill gives effect to that decision. Clearly, this is a cynical attempt to buy votes in the rural sector at the time of the South Australian State election. The Opposition supports the Bill because it believes that the subsidy will in part alleviate some of the cost pressures facing agriculture. We support the principle encompassed in this Bill. We do not support the other exercise of the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to take up much of the time of the House this morning but I do wish to support the initiative of the Government in this decision to replace the tariff on imported harvesters with an equivalent bounty on local production, effective from 21 August 1985. Of course, honourable members would be aware that the tariff on grain harvesters that applied previously had raised the costs of farmers, who now face, of course, declining returns on world markets. Over the period of the last couple of years honourable members would be only too well aware of the concerns on both sides of the House with regard to the policies of the European Community and, of course, in latter days the prospect of a trade war in regard to the United States export enhancement program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I certainly cannot let this opportunity go by without responding to the rather unfortunate comment by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). He suggested, to use his words, that this was some sort of cynical attempt to buy votes for the South Australian election. As you would be perfectly well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Honourable members would recall that over the last few months there have been continuing discussions between members of the Government and peak bodies in the rural sector, principally the National Farmers Federation; so much so that following the concerns expressed outside this House on 1 July this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in conjunction with Australia's greatest Minister for Primary Industry, undertook to bring down a package to do something to assist the rising costs that people in the rural sector were facing. Of course, part of that response was this decision to replace tariffs on harvesters with a system of bounties. Of course, the measure was not in total isolation, but was in conjunction also with the decision to rebate full diesel excise. The other decision, of course, was that the Government should take steps to ensure that assistance arrangements for the production of agricultural chemicals do not also impose undue costs on agricultural users.</PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in the past on the whole question of whether we should have bounties or tariffs. My general view is-and I repeat it for the benefit of honourable members who are interested in this debate-that where possible we should proceed down this track. This legislation-the subsidy for grain harvesters and equipment-is an admirable step. It is a decision, of course, that has a revenue cost to the Government; but most significantly it has a great impact on primary producers. In recent days people who represent rural and provincial seats, I am sure, would have seen large scale advertisements in their local Press by people who are involved in the retailing of grain harvesters, bringing to the attention of their customers the benefits of this decision. I have seen advertisements in local newspapers suggesting that there has been a downward reduction in costs of up to $8,000 or $9,000 per harvester. So this decision is particularly welcome.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also particularly welcome for another reason. Honourable members would recall that the initial decision was to apply this part of the Government's budgetary measures from 1 January 1986. As the Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, noted in his second reading speech, prior to 21 August 1985 a substantial number of grain harvesters were imported for sale in the current season. Most of those harvesters have yet to be sold, with the result that importers would therefore have been faced with the prospect of having to sell duty paid machines in the 1985 season in competition with other harvesters which would be duty free, or with locally produced machines on which the subsidy under the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill would have become payable. Obviously, honourable members would appreciate that this would have seriously disadvantaged some suppliers because it is a fiercely competitive market, not only because of world factors but also because of the cost pressures that local rural producers are facing.</PARA>
<PARA> I certainly support the initiatives of the Government that this measure represents. It represents a positive package for the rural sector. As I said at the outset, it should not be seen in total isolation, but as part of a package to do something about costs to the rural sector, something of which all honourable members should be conscious. If they are not conscious of it, they should be, because despite the decline in the percentage of export income earned from primary industry over the last few years, honourable members should not forget that agricultural exports from Australia still contribute about 40 per cent of our export wealth. So anything that we can do to encourage local farmers to be cost competitive, to enable them to compete-as my friend the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) said yesterday in his comments on another Bill-in a world market that is unfortunately corrupted by subsidised pricing arrangements throughout the world, should be welcomed by the farming community and by this House. I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a bipartisan debate on the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters) and Equipment Bill this morning. I support the Bill, as the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has done. However, I remind the House that while we sit here in airconditioned comfort reflecting on what we think ought to happen to the grain harvest industry in Australia there are, right now, people in harvesters taking off the crop that will ensure Australia's economic future. It is too easy to forget that there are people in the middle of harvesting right now. This Bill is being brought into the House, this debate is occurring, in the middle of Australia's grain harvest. Those farmers who are listening to this debate and who are sitting in their tractors or their self-propelled headers making their way around paddocks might well be asking themselves quite reasonably how much of the grain which is rattling into the bin they are taking off for themselves and how much they are taking off to pay off inflated government.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a fair comment from the Minister. Sometimes I am tempted to make the same observation. Nonetheless, I make the valid observation that every farmer might well ask himself how many bushels of what ever he is harvesting he is harvesting simply to discharge the increasing costs he faces as a result of being on the land. I make the plea to the House this morning to be aware of the fact that there are many farmers who are making their way around paddocks, not in those airconditioned shiny new monsters that so many honourable members opposite see in agricultural shows, but in headers which need replacement and which they cannot afford to replace either because of the cost of the header or the falling farm income which is the reality of agriculture today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The agricultural industry consumes something like 2,000 down to 1,500 new grain harvester units a year. These fall into two categories. The smaller harvesters are power take-off driven and tractor pulled; the larger of them are self-propelled headers, with their own capacity to move around the paddock independent of any other mobile unit. Most of the power take-off driven units used in Australia in fact are manufactured in Australia. By volume these power take-off units make up about 30 per cent of the market.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty I have with the legislation before the House is that it has been conceived and has arrived in the House in such haste. The honourable member for Ryan has already referred to the fact that the legislation currently before the House allows grain harvesters, and the bounty to be applied to grain harvesters, to fall into two categories. The first is for those harvesters which are overseas produced and assembled here in Australia. It is considered that the value added category of these will be less than 40 per cent. Therefore, the bounty available under this legislation will be paid at 25 per cent of the cost of the assembly of these machines. The second category-the category I suspect most occupies the concern of both sides of the House-is the area of local manufacturing. People who are locally manufacturing harvesters are anticipated, as a result of the Industries Assistance Commission review, to have a proportion of that harvester which is over 40 per cent value added. These harvesters which fall into the over 40 per cent value added category will attract a bounty of 12 1/2 per cent ex-factory price.</PARA>
<PARA> I make particular reference to these because one of the major manufacturers in Australia in fact has a large assembly plant in my electorate. I refer to Horwood Bagshaw Ltd which assembles harvesters, as the honourable member for Ryan said, at Mannum in my electorate. In fact, that company at its Mannum plant employs 257 people. Therefore, the Bill before the House does not affect only the farmers of Australia it does not affect only the equally important farm labourers of Australia, some of the few people left productively working in this nation; the Bill also affects 257 people who are employed at the Horwood Bagshaw factory in Mannum and the many other additional employees of Horwood Bagshaw in the city of Adelaide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo has interjected to remind me that according to his statistics there are in fact 1,200 employees of Horwood Bagshaw involved in assembly and sales in the city of Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some concerns felt by Horwood Bagshaw have been expressed by the honourable member for Ryan. I think it is fair to say that the Opposition trusts that negotiations currently in hand between the Government and the Opposition will, in the other House, result in an outcome that is even more satisfactory from the point of view of the assembler in my electorate. Honourable members might ask why I think further negotiations are necessary. I think it is fair to observe that among the local manufacturers some concern is being expressed that it will be increasingly difficult for them to maintain their 40 per cent content as the devaluation of the Australian dollar forces up the prices of the imports they use in assembling their local machines; hence the discussion that we are anticipating will occur between the Government and the Opposition when this Bill is introduced into the other House. It is to be hoped that the Government can come to some further sensible agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> As has been made quite obvious this morning, the Opposition welcomes, as does the honour- able member for Calare (Mr Simmons), the move from tariff assistance to bounty assistance. This industry was protected by a 15 per cent tariff. That tariff cost the grain growers of Australia-the grain growers, if you please; no one else-$14m, as has been calculated by the National Farmers Federation. It is as a result of the move from the tariff to the bounty that this legislation is before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has had a chequered passage which reflects the incapacity of the Government to understand what in fact happens down on the farm. The legislation was first proposed to be introduced effective as from 1 January 1986 when, to all intents and purposes, the harvest would be over. It is true that some people would still have crops to harvest but they would not be about to buy a header in order to complete the harvest. Therefore, having come to terms with that, I would have thought, conspicuously obvious fact, the Government then said: `We will make this legislation effective from 21 August 1985, Budget night'. Of course, this meant that no consideration was taken of the equally conspicuously obvious fact that header manufacturers in Australia and header importers in Australia had stocks in hand that would have been disadvantaged against anything produced or imported post 21 August 1985. So back we go again. It is the further changes, which in fact have been made to accommodate the stock in hand, that promoted the legislation before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been concerned that it has taken so long for us to develop what ought to have been a conspicuously simple policy in the grain harvester area. Government members come into the House and berate the Opposition-they pour derision on the Opposition-for what they declare is the Opposition's absence of policies. The real pressure for policies exists in the Government. Honourable members opposite are the people who have the numbers; they make the decisions. However, after these seven years it took the agricultural policy of the Australian Labor Party to be first announced and three years after being in government we still find ourselves having to debate the legislation currently before the House within crude time restraints.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Calare has commended the Government for its move from tariff protection to bounty protection. All members opposite join in and echo that commendation. However, we cannot sit down in this debate without drawing the Government's attention to the fact that farmers across Australia are currently disadvantaged. Farmers across Australia are currently the squeaky wheels of the Australian community. They are squeaky wheels not because they need more grease but because the burden they are asked to carry, the load that is on the cart, is all too heavy. The honourable member for Calare has said: `This Bill is part of reducing the burden that farmers carry'. In opposition we welcome that move. However, it is but a small part of reducing the total burden which right now the farmers around Australia are carrying and which, I am sorry to say, they are carrying as a result of the policies introduced by this Government. The Government simply cannot manage an economy in a manner which results in a falling Australian dollar and consequent rising interest rates and not recognise the enormous burden that those interest rates put on Australian farmers.</PARA>
<PARA> We welcome this legislation but a great deal more needs to be done to relieve the load that is being carried by Australian farmers on behalf of the rest of the community. It is true that this package helps in some small way to reduce part of that load. However, a great deal more needs to be done to address the whole question of wage fixation and economic policy in this nation if we are in any way to assist the farmers of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking today about the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985. Like previous speakers on both sides of the House, I welcome the general thrust of this legislation. The Bill proposes that assistance by way of subsidy on grain harvesters and certain parts of grain harvesters produced in Australia replace the tariff which has been in existence since 1973. As the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said, no doubt the wheat growers of Australia will welcome this move because wheat has shown very low profitability in Australia in recent years. In round figures, the growers are getting of the order of $150 a tonne. When they take out their costs of carting by rail monopolies, et cetera, they are getting back only something in excess of $90 a tonne, and then they have to take out their own costs. They certainly need yields of six, eight or more bags per acre before they start to break even, let alone make a profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original tariff was introduced in 1973 following an Industries Assistance Commission review of assistance to the grain harvester industry. It automatically came in as a tariff and the coalition Government in power at the time said that it would revoke that and change it to a bounty. Unfortunately it made one grave mistake and called an election that year and did not have a chance to implement that legislation. We pointed out to the incoming Government, the present Government, that it should be switched to a bounty. It saw merit in the case and said that it would look at it. Unfortunately it has taken 2 1/2 years for it to bring in the legislation. In the meantime it has cost the grain growers of this nation of the order of $14m a year, so since 1983 it has cost in total in excess of $30m. Of course, this is not the only measure to which the Government has applied similar principles. The diesel levy rebate was removed. It has now been restored, I am pleased to say. But that cost the grain growers and farmers of this country in excess of $55m.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not refunded or backdated. It was just put on in the Budget. In other words, the Government restored something that it had taken away and made a hero of itself. Nevertheless, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in the Budget of 20 August that the tariff would be removed and replaced by a bounty. Even though this announcement was belated, we still welcome it. A 15 per cent tariff may not sound much to people who have not thought about it but, with the price of grain harvesters today, it is quite a substantial amount of money. A farmer may have to fork out in the order of $100,000 for a new harvester and a 15 per cent tariff means that he will have to pay another $15,000, which is probably more than he is making in a year. So it is a very substantial cost to the farming industry today. I see that the Government is bringing in the subsidy on grain harvesters produced in Australia in two stages. The explanatory notes say that the Government will pay:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) 12.5 per cent of the sales value of the harvester if the value added to the harvester by the manufacturer is not less than 40 per cent . . .</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in any other case-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, less than 40 per cent-</PARA>
<PARA>an amount equal to 25 per cent of the value added by the manufacturer.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, we have not had sufficient notice that this Bill was to be introduced so that we could study it and comment more fully. I would be grateful if the Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Mr Barry Jones) in summing up would elaborate on his reasons for that.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and the short notice. It is a pity that we did not have more time to fully debate the legislation here and consider it beforehand so that our contribution could be greater. I would like to qualify my statements endorsing switching tariff to bounty by saying that all protection is bad because it misallocates resources and moves resources in Australia from efficient industries to inefficient ones. If protection is put on by tariff, by quota or by a local content scheme or whatever, the user has to pay. This has been the case for the grain growers in Australia to date. One might ask: Why should the user of the protected goods pay? It is quite an illogical thing to do. If the Government wants to protect an industry, which is, of course, its right, I believe all should share equally. That is why particularly the coalition here today supports the protection being given by way of bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Protection, in whatever shape or form, is eventually a cost to the consumers of this country and it is interesting to note that projected costs for 1984-85 will run into a consumer tax equivalent of just under $13,000m, which is quite horrific. In the textile, clothing and footwear and motor vehicle industries alone the estimate for 1984-85 is just under $5,000m. The tariff is costing tens of thousands of dollars; the subsidy to the assemblers of the harvesters manufactured in Australia is running into tens of thousands of dollars. It has been one of the most inefficient industries as far as protection goes. The sooner we get it switched to bounty the better. I welcome, as I say, switching it to bounty because it reduces the cost to the grain growers and switches it to all Australians. I see that this present legislation will remain in force until 31 December 1990 and sometime before that it will be reviewed by the IAC. Hopefully it will not be switched back to tariff again and certainly I do not believe that it will if the coalition is in power.</PARA>
<PARA> I also see that a special subsidy is to be paid on imported harvesters, and previous speakers have referred to this. Prior to the Treasurer's announcement on 21 August in the Budget, a number of grain harvesters would have been imported for sale and tariff would have been paid on them. These harvesters have been sitting on the lot and most of them have yet to be sold. Harvesters brought in after that date do not have that 15 per cent tariff penalty and, therefore, in a very cost competitive world for machinery salesmen there is probably no way that these machines can be sold. It has been causing a considerable amount of distress, I know, amongst machinery salesmen in my electorate. I am delighted to see that the Government has considered this and is going to waive the tariff on those. I note that the Minister says in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>This would have seriously disadvantaged some suppliers in a fiercely competitive market, already depressed because of other domestic and world factors.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know what those factors are and why machinery sales are depressed. Interest rates, of course, are at the highest level in real terms that we have seen in this country for over half a century and interest rates are very important for farmers who buy headers because none can afford to pay cash outright. Some have brought harvesters at rates of 12, 13 or 14 per cent and have had finance from banks, and every time they go down to their mail box they find that interest rates have leapt another half a per cent; and some are now paying 19, 20 or 21 per cent.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgraceful. They have also been hit by fuel costs-that is a factor in depressing sales-not to mention the other costs. For example, the grain handling authority in New South Wales has all but crippled the wheat industry in that State. Nevertheless, I see that subsidies will now be available in respect of domestic sales of imported grain harvesters cleared for home consumption before 21 August this year and sold on or after that date. I also welcome the fact that the subsidies will be extended to parts for grain harvesters that fall within the classification. The subsidy will be equivalent to the net duty paid on the subsidised harvesters or equivalent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One other factor I will mention which is depressing sales is the capital gains tax that will apply to people who purchase harvesters on lease and then buy out the lease at the end of, say, four years. When they trade in that harvester later they will find that they get a trade-in higher than the amount of the lease on the harvester and will have to pay capital gains tax on that paper capital gain. I think the Government would do well to look at that related matter also, to help reduce costs for the grain growers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would just like to comment that protection that farmers receive overall is only a fraction of what the manufacturing industry in this country receives. It is only about a quarter of it. We pay high tariffs on hay making equipment of something like 15 per cent, on tillage equipment at a similar level, on seeders and ploughs at a similar level, something equivalent to 30 per cent on fully formulated chemicals that are bought in Australia and on four-wheel drive vehicles, tariffs ranging from 25 per cent to 57 1/2 per cent. The small amount of assistance that farmers get is nothing like what the rest of the Australian community gets.</PARA>
<PARA> I note that the subsidy arrangements in this Bill will involve costs of approximately $5.65m in the coming year and of the order of $3.75 per year thereafter during the life of the scheme. The total costs, including revenue forgone as a result of the related tariff change, will be approximately $9.75m this financial year and about $12m annually thereafter. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the qualifying statements that I have made on this Bill, I welcome the legislation that the Government has brought in, as belated as it is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985. A few moments ago the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones), who is handling this measure in the House, asked me whether I was going to give the House the benefit of my advice on this matter. I assure him that all the advice I can give really comes from him and his colleague in the Senate. It is very difficult to devise uniform and equitable arrangements for an industry which has patterns of production and cost structures which vary widely from producer to producer. Hence the adoption today of a two-part scheme which should reduce the cost of grain harvesters to farmers whilst maintaining assistance to local producers by means of a subsidy rather than a tariff. The Industries Assistance Commission considered the effect of the present tariff in its report `Grain Harvesters and Parts (Bounty Arrangements)' which was made on 28 October 1985. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The direct effect of the present tariff arrangements is to raise the landed cost of imported grain harvesters and certain parts. . . .</PARA>
<PARA> The indirect effect of these tariff arrangements is to allow local manufacturers of goods competing against dutiable imports to raise their prices. The extent of this increase is difficult to quantify, but a reasonable first approximation is that their output prices are increased by 13.5 per cent. . . .</PARA>
<PARA> However, local manufacturers are also penalised in that the prices of many of the inputs which they use are raised as a result of tariff assistance. Consequently, the Commission generally uses an estimate of the effective rate of assistance when it discusses the effects of the assistance structure on production activities. This measure attempts to quantify the net effects of the tariff structure on the productive activity under reference, taking into account both the subsidy effect on output and the tax effect on inputs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission went on to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that removal of the duty on grain harvesters and parts has the potential to result in significantly different effects for the three industry segments. . . . the extent of these differences will also be influenced by the form of the offsetting bounty to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to indicate a preferred option after discussing a number of the options in relation to the introduction of a bounty. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>A specific rate bounty would be administratively cumbersome. An ad valorem output bounty would favour assembly operations relative to major local production. A value added bounty would favour one local producer against another and reduce assistance to assembly operations.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission said further:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the tariff is to be removed-</PARA>
<PARA>as we are doing here-</PARA>
<PARA>on both grain harvesters and parts falling within tariff item 84.25.9, the Commission's preferred option would be the provision of two different forms of bounty-one to major local producers of complete grain harvesters and another to other local producers of goods under reference as discussed above in section 3.3.4</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in the 1985-86 Budget as one of the important initiatives to assist the rural sector that tariffs on grain harvesters were to be replaced by a subsidy on local production. It asked the Industries Assistance Commission to advise on the assistance level and conditions that should apply over the next five years, consistent with the level of assistance accorded producers by way of tariff. The Commission has come up with that report and I believe that the Government has correctly-and I am delighted to see bipartisan support for the Government's decision-come up with the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985, which I am pleased to support.</PARA>

I do not want to speak too repetitively on points that have been made by other members speaking in this debate. Like my colleagues and, indeed, honourable members opposite, I certainly do support this Bill and I am glad to see the Government moving once more away from dependence on tariffs to provide industry assistance through the method of bounty, although, of course, we do not want to get ourselves into the position where we are continually providing assistance of one form or another to industries which may not have any long term chance of survival. I do not think that is necessarily the case here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do want to reiterate some of the points made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in relation to Horwood Bagshaw Ltd whose manufacturing operations are based in the town of Mannum in the electorate of Wakefield. Many of its employees live in my electorate in the town of Murray Bridge.</PARA>
<PARA> In a message that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sent to the Managing Director of Horwood Bagshaw on 3 September the Prime Minister pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government `gave an undertaking that local producers will receive level of assistance at least equivalent to that presently accorded by the 15 per cent tariff on imported machines'.</PARA>
<PARA>That seemed a reasonable statement at the time, but as the honourable member for Wakefield has pointed out, the way this legislation has been drafted-I suspect it has been overhastily drafted and not really carefully enough considered-it does, in fact, discriminate against Horwood Bradshaw in a way that it does not discriminate against other manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that a bounty will be given if the value added in production is not less than 40 per cent of ex-factory selling prices. In the case of Horwood Bagshaw, 50 per cent of its production is of a product known as the PTO 1070. That does qualify for the bounty, but 50 per cent of its production is of a machine known as the SP 2140. Production of this particular machine has only approximately 30 per cent value added or perhaps slightly more. The effect of the Bill as it is currently drafted is that Horwood Bagshaw will not receive the bounty that it had anticipated and, indeed, which the South Australian Government had anticipated because it is paying the company an interim subsidy until this Bill finally comes into effect. That is clearly going to impose a very substantial burden on Horwood Bagshaw. I do not think the Government would want to place much a burden on that company bearing in mind the difficulties it would clearly create, not just for the profitability of the firm-it has struggled over a number of years to return to profitability from a loss of nearly $6m in 1982-83 to a profit this financial year announced today of $775,000-but for the employees, some of whom live in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this drafting error-I believe it is an error-on this company is going to be a 43 per cent reduction in the assistance accorded to it. I hope very much that the Government will reconsider this drafting error-I reiterate that I see it as a drafting error-in order to fulfil the commitment that the Prime Minister made to Horwood Bagshaw back in September and that it will not breach that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last two minutes that are available to me, I should like to make a couple of other points about this Bill. Principally, this Bill was foreshadowed in the Budget as, if one likes, a sop to the rural sector in response to demonstrations by members of the National Farmers Federation and the strong pressure that the Federal Opposition has placed on the Government to try to do something to help a very hard hit rural sector. Although I support the Bill very strongly, I believe it represents far too little far too late. At the same time as introducing a minor change in assistance to help grain growers, the Government is being quite hypocritical in introducing two forms of pernicious taxation, namely, the capital gains tax and the quarantining of farm losses, which discriminate against the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth pointing out that the level of fuel excises has increased by some 56.5 per cent since the Hawke Government took office and that has seriously disadvantaged farmers, particularly as the diesel fuel rebate was reduced for two years. Also, of course, primary producers are being hit very hard by the record level of interest rates. So, in the face of these major problems-interest rates, fuel costs and the taxation burden-this legislation is nothing more than a sop to primary producers. However, in saying that, I believe it is a constructive measure. Should the Government amend the drafting error that it has made and which discriminates against Horwood Bagshaw, I will give this Bill my full support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I want to reply very briskly to the points that have been made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), although I would be just as happy to tell him over a cup of coffee. On the question of the complaints of Horwood Bagshaw Ltd, the Industries Assistance Commission suggested an eligibility threshold for the ad valorem output bounty of 30 per cent of 110 per cent of the manufacturer's cost to make. This is a reference point for the purpose of calculation or substitute for ex-factory selling price. This was in response to strong representations from the industry, including Horwood Bagshaw. It was decided that ex-factory selling price would be a more appropriate basis for all calculations, being somewhat higher generally than 110 per cent of cost to make. This required an upward adjustment in the minimum value added from 30 per cent to 40 per cent to maintain the relativities between the two parts of the composite scheme. The scheme, of course, is designed to cater for the industry as a whole and maintain the assistance structure as nearly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) raised a number of points. The measure was announced in the Budget and the terms and conditions were referred to the IAC for advice on the details. That process took longer than expected, hence the reason for the delay in the introduction of the Bill. I am sure that no one would wish to argue against its speedy introduction and passage so that farmers can obtain the benefits quickly. Various speakers raised points about the operative date for this new subsidy scheme. As I said, the Bill honours the Government's Budget commitment to reduce farm costs and as a Budget measure the operative date was the day after the Budget was presented. Nevertheless, the Government has dealt in an equitable manner with the problem of unsold stocks of harvesters on hand at the date of transition.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) made a point about the effects on devaluation on local content. Clause 13 (1) provides for a minimum value addes rate of other than 40 per cent to be prescribed by regulation. This gives the Government the necessary flexibility to adjust the eligibility threshold for the ad valorem output subsidy. As the honourable member would recognise, it is not possible to apply a benefit that is specific to an area, even if an area is as highly disadvantaged as the electorate of Wakefield might be because of the-</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill aims to achieve a fairer basis for funding child care centres. This Government has demonstrated a major commitment to the provision of child care in Australia. Since we were elected there has been significant growth in child care services. The number of places for full day care has increased from 37,580 in June 1982 to 63,535 in June 1985-an increase of about 70 per cent. Expenditure on children's services has increased from $65m in 1982-83 to an expected $143m in 1985-86. This rate of growth has been much faster than in other comparable programs and far in excess of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding our record of achievement, we were not satisfied with the level of community access to quality child care services. As a result, in December 1984 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced this Government's commitment to the provision of a further 20,000 child care places over the next three years. It was a good time to reassess funding mechanisms. The Child Care Act had been operating for over 10 years. Service providers and children's services organisations had found inequities in parts of the Act, particularly in the complex formula governing operational subsidy. There was also concern about the costs associated with maintaining child care centres. There were few, if any, incentives for service providers to keep costs down. Higher costs were subsidised by higher government fee relief subsidies; and insufficient contribution was being made by families with higher incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> Equity was a major concern in two senses. Firstly the Government was concerned that despite the large growth over the last two years the program still only reached about 7.5 per cent of pre-school age children. We believed that higher recurrent costs would make it difficult to continue to expand the program beyond the additional 20,000 places we were committed to. Secondly, we were concerned to ensure that child care centres received funding on a consistent basis. Under the current funding system this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided to review the subsidy arrangements for full day care services. This review was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the context of the May economic statement. Any review likely to come up with valuable long term administrative and policy change had to get to the roots of the problem. So the Government set a target of $30m savings that it would like to achieve in a full year. But to be consistent with the Government's priorities, these savings had to be found responsibly and within basic principles that reflected the need to maintain standards and quality of care and to maintain affordable child care particularly for low and moderate income earners. We were not prepared to surrender these fundamental principles.</PARA>
<PARA> A comprehensive examination of child care funding was carried out and it became clear that it was not possible to achieve savings of more than about $10m in a full year, without breaching the principles that had been set. I make no apology for that. The Government's purpose was to ensure that its commitment to the expansion of the child care places could be achieved, reaching as many people as possible, at a responsible cost.</PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the subsidy arrangements provided by this Bill will ensure that the essential characteristics of quality services will be maintained and that services will be accessible to families, particularly those on low incomes and with special needs. These changes are aimed at the long term future of the program. The Government believes they established a sound base for the expansion of the program in the next three years and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA>Overview of Children's Services</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Before describing these changes I want to take this opportunity to review achievement under the children's services program and to set the direction in which this Government will be taking the program. When the Child Care Act was introduced there were about 50 non-profit centres in this country. Today there are in excess of 800 and about 300 of these have been approved for funding by this Government since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the children's services program, but outside the Child Care Act, other services were funded to meet the child care needs of parents, particularly of working parents. Some 260 family day care schemes have been established, over 50 by this Government. Last year the Government put the funding of family day care on a firmer basis by increasing the operational subsidy by 20 per cent and introducing an additional part time allowance of $3 a child. Expenditure on family day care has increased from $15m in 1982-83 to an expected $40m in 1985-86. There are 432 outside school hours care services, over 160 established by this Government. The Government regards out of school hours care as essential if child care provision is to respond to the needs of working parents. Last year the Government increased funding for these services by an average of 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Other services have developed under the umbrella of the children's services program. These include special services to meet the needs of children who because of background, disability or where they live do not have ready access to standard child care. There are special services for Aboriginal and disabled children and children of ethnic origin and for those who live in remote and isolated areas. We are also intent on facilitating the access of Aboriginal, migrant and disabled children to centre-based care and family day care and special grants are available for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that child care is affordable for low and moderate income earners. The Government's commitment to making child care affordable is evidenced by the new fee relief system introduced in July 1984. This reform meant that families eligible under a national income test pay the same fees at the same income level. There are special provisions that ensure child care is affordable for families who have more than one child in care. Under the new arrangements fee relief will be extended and simplified to ensure that child care remains affordable. This means we are targeting a larger proportion of funds to meet income related need while continuing to subsidise all families through operational assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> So that new services are distributed equitably and are located where they are most needed, the Government last year introduced a planning model and established consultative machinery in each State. For the first time there is a rational basis for the planning and establishment of new places. There is also for the first time a long term commitment by the Government. We will establish 20,000 new places over the next three years. This is currently estimated to cost $107m. Over the last 10 years a number of innovative programs developed under the children's services program. The family support services scheme began in 1978 to stimulate the provision of services for families with dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA> The family support services scheme continues to be administered by the Office of Child Care, but it is now a separate program with its own budget allocation. Another important initiative was the youth services scheme, which is now part of the supported accommodation assistance program. The children's services program therefore had a broad focus at a time when there were no other suitable auspices to advance important policy initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA> With the establishment of other more targeted services, it is no longer necessary for the children's services program to take initiatives across such a broad range. Accordingly we have been reassessing and focusing the objectives and direction of the program. The children's services program will continue to provide funding to non-profit services that advance the developmental, social, emotional and intellectual needs of children while their parents are working, training for work or actively seeking work. The provision of an additional 16,000 full day care places gives added emphasis to this objective, as does the provision of an additional 4,500 out of school hours care places. We will also be responding to the needs of women at home and the provision of an additional 3,000 occasional care places reinforces this commitment. We will continue to ensure that all services are available to Aboriginal, disabled and migrant children and that as appropriate, specific culturally relevant services are established for these groups.</PARA>
<PARA>The Changes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to office we have taken significant steps towards achieving rationality and equity in the program. The changes which are the subject of this Bill take this process further. They will mainly impact on centre based day care and will take effect from the beginning of April 1986.</PARA>
<PARA>Operational Subsidy</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Currently operational subsidies average $30 a week and benefit all families irrespective of income. For example, families using child care centres who now pay the full price pay an average of $55 a week for full time care even though the actual cost of care is on average $85 a week. The current system is complex and leads to inequities, including market disparities in operational subsidies between centres. Another important concern is that small reductions in the number of children can lead to a big reduction in salary subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new operational subsidy arrangements set out in clause 3 of the Bill, centres will get a subsidy of $16 a week for each approved place for children under three and $11 a week for each approved place for children aged three or more. This recognises the special needs of younger children and the higher costs of caring for them. These subsidies will be for services that operate for at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours a day and for at least 48 weeks a year. Additional grants will be provided to centres that are approved to operate for more than 10 hours. Current levels of operational subsidy will be reduced by about half, resulting in an average increase of $15 in a centre's full time fee to a new average of $70 a week. This does not mean that most users will pay this much more as the fee relief changes will ensure that full increases in fees will only be met by those families with higher incomes. The subsidy will be adjusted from time to time to reflect cost of living and wage increases. It will also be paid in advance in order to alleviate cash flow problems.</PARA>
<PARA>Impact on Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the changes in operational subsidy will be reduced by changes in the fee relief system. These changes, while not requiring legislation, are an integral part of the new funding package. Higher costs resulting from the overall reduction in operational subsidy will largely be offset by greater fee relief subsidies for low and moderate income earners and by moderately increased fees to be paid by high income earners. In other words the balance of the Commonwealth's overall contribution to care has been redesigned to give increasing emphasis to income related need. Under section 12A of the Child Care Act the Commonwealth provides funds to centres so that families on low to moderate incomes pay reduced fees. These arrangements will be extended and simplified to ensure that child care remains affordable. Under the new fee relief system:</PARA>
<PARA>The minimum fee will be increased by 5c an hour or $2 a week for full time care, that is, 40 hours a week;</PARA>
<PARA>families with one child in care, whose incomes mean they pay more than the minimum fee, will pay 15c extra in fees for each extra dollar they earn above an assessed family income of $225 a week, until they are liable to pay the full fee. Previously the 15c rate applied only to families with an assessed family income of less than $467 a week; above that they paid 30c extra for each dollar earned;</PARA>
<PARA>special arrangements for large families are also improved. The rate will be a uniform 20c for families with two or more children in care. The previous rate was 40c when assessed family income exceeded $467 a week;</PARA>
<PARA>fee relief will not be offered for that part of a centre's fee in excess of $80 a week. This measure is an incentive to contain costs as centres will have to consider the additional burden on families if they want to charge a higher fee; and</PARA>
<PARA>additional assistance-special fee relief-will continue, at the discretion of the centre, to families in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Special transitional assistance will be available in the first year only, to ensure that no family has to pay more than $25 a week more and to encourage centres to charge no more than $85 a week.</PARA>
<PARA>Impact on Child Care Centres</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The combination of the new operational subsidy and other changes ensures the viability of centres. They will still be expected and able to operate on break-even budgets. The measures are designed to make administration much more simple for both the management committees of centres and the Government. This will save costs and centres will have a better idea of how much subsidy they will get each year.</PARA>
<PARA>Impact on Women</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government's child care policy including the proposed changes is consistent with the Government's equal opportunity and affirmative action initiatives. The continuation and improvement of the fee relief system limits work force disincentives and the 20,000 place commitment will result in increased access to child care.</PARA>
<PARA>Impact on Quality</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government remains committed to providing quality care that promotes the developmental, social, emotional and intellectual needs of the child. It is for this reason that the Government has continued to provide a substantial operational subsidy irrespective of income and to provide higher subsidy for under three-year-olds in recognition of their need for a higher staff-child ratio. It is the responsibility of State governments to regulate child care and license child care centres, and services funded by the Commonwealth have to comply with State government regulations. However, the Government is actively committed to funding and promoting quality child care. It is important that the Government is well informed on trends in quality and that funded services have access to professional advice and assistance on matters pertaining to programming, play activities, developmental needs of children and so on. For this reason I have asked the Australian Early Childhood Association to advise me on quality issues and to strengthen and extend their current role in providing advice and assistance to funded services. Capital, equipment and establishment grants provided under the Child Care Act will be continued and are a further indication of this Government's commitment to quality care.</PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The measures provided in this Bill are expected to reduce the Government's subsidies to the children's services program by $2.6m in 1985-86 and $10.2m in a full year. The additional administrative costs of implementing these measures are estimated to be $0.46m in both 1985-86 and 1986-87.</PARA>
<PARA>Child Care Objectives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I have set out today not only to explain the purpose of this Bill but also to provide honourable members with a broader understanding of the background to the children's services program and the reasons for the Government's decision to change the way in which subsidies for centres are provided. I have touched on some of the essential characteristics of the program to which the Government is committed. Finally, I intend to outline the objectives of the children's services program in order to ensure that there are advantages and understanding of the framework in which funding decisions are made. The Government's primary objective is to ensure that parents and children have access to quality children's services that are appropriate to their needs regardless of their income level, cultural background, disability or geographical location. Within this broad objective the Government's priorities are towards providing non-profit services that:</PARA>
<PARA>Promote the developmental, social, emotional and intellectual needs of children without substituting for the care they receive from their parents;</PARA>
<PARA>are consistent with the Government's policies of equal opportunity and affirmative action, and are predominantly directed towards meeting the needs of children of working parents or parents who are undertaking vocational training to enter the work force;</PARA>
<PARA>encourage parent participation in management;</PARA>
<PARA>are accessible for low and moderate income earners;</PARA>
<PARA>focus on under school age children but also provide older children with care out of school hours and during school holidays;</PARA>
<PARA>support parents at home with young children;</PARA>
<PARA>assist those with special needs such as Aboriginal, migrant and disabled children and children in remote and isolated parts of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>are accessible to the general community.</PARA>
<PARA>Summary</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The measures in this Bill represent a fundamental redesign of child care funding arrangements. The new structure blends the objectives of equity, quality and affordability as well as simplifying the administration of the program. In addition sensible cost controls are now contained in the structure. The program is well placed to expand and respond to contemporary child care needs. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all very well for Government members to want to be running from the only public forum we have in this country. Democracy is a bit harsh for members of the Government; they want to run from the House. This Bill introduces new funding arrangements for Commonwealth subsidised long day child care centres. By way of background it is interesting to note that in November 1984 there were an estimated 2.9 million children under 12 years of age, 358,000 of whom were using formal child care, and 41 per cent of those were receiving from 10 to 19 hours of child care weekly. Around 864,000 received informal child care. Commonwealth funds provide assistance for some 63,129 equivalent full time places for children under five years of age in 832 child care centres and 262 family day care schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main changes proposed by this legislation include, firstly, an alteration to the basis of subsidy. At present the subsidy is related to staff costs. The new subsidy will be determined on the number of approved child care places in an institution. The Bill will also enable the payment of a basic subsidy in respect of each approved place, with a slightly higher subsidy for children under three years of age. The Bill provides for an increase in the means tested minimum fee, which is paid by 58 per cent of users. That minimum fee will increase from $10 to $12 a week. The withdrawal of the income tested subsidy, called a fee relief subsidy, will have effect at a lower weekly income as a result of this legislation, but the rate of withdrawal will be halved. This legislation will also establish a top fee of $80 a week after the basic subsidy for centres with subsidised places.</PARA>
<PARA> What, then, is the impact of the legislation? In the May statement this year it was promised that the savings arising from this legislation would be $30m. Now we are being told that the overall savings in a full year will be $10.2m. This dramatically highlights the confusion and lack of policy direction of this Government. Government decisions are announced on the run without proper consultation and planning. The Government has a total lack of long term goals or visions for Australia. As a result, it is constantly making decisions such as this one-decisions made under pressure, reacting to the latest crisis instead of being on a well planned path to a considered and publicly supported objective. It is little wonder that our dollar has been devalued and interest rates are going through the roof when the Government shows day after day a total lack of long term policy making. The result is stupid announcements-</PARA>

As a result of the Government's failure to establish long term policy goals stupid announcements are made without consideration of all the factors which should have been under consideration originally, and when those factors are brought to light by public reaction the Government backs and fills and tries to cover its tracks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition is firmly committed to reducing the size of government and reducing government expenditure, but we really wonder about the priorities of the Australian Labor Party when in this instance it is taking $10m out of the area of child care support, an area in which we would have expected the Labor Party, if it matched its promises and rhetoric with action, to provide more assistance. But talk is cheap for the Labor Party, as we found out from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Promises before the last election that there would be no capital gains tax have not been met and legislation is now being introduced imposing a capital gains tax. He promised before the last election-and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) promised it this year-that interest rates would go down. People with commercial loans, housing loans and mortgages who now have to pay much higher interest rates will understand that the people in the Labor Party are not men of their word.</PARA>
<PARA> The point I make in relation to this $10m cut in funding for child care centres and child care assistance is that, while we would like to reduce, and in power would reduce, government expenditure, we really wonder about this Government's priorities. For example, last year it was prepared to spend over $1m publicising Medicare. It spent $1m just before the last election telling the people what a great thing Medicare was. As I understand it, Medicare is compulsory. People in Australia do not have a choice whether or not to purchase Medicare; they are compulsorily part of Medicare and are required to pay a levy. But that did not stop the Government spending $1m of taxpayers' funds in saying what a terrific thing Medicare was, when it was something in which consumers had no choice. I just wonder whether that $1m would not have been better spent in the provision of child care assistance instead of in trying to convince the public that what it had to do was in fact a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA> Only last night we heard in this place about extravagant and wasteful expenditure in the Australian Institute of Sport. How can the Government justify the Executive Director of that Institute spending $7,000 on a desk?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister made the point, in error. He misrepresented what I said and I am entitled to correct the error. The Opposition's concern in relation to this legislation is that, while the Government is prepared to spend money on public relations campaigns to try to shore up its own credibility, it is not prepared to continue to fund child care centres at the existing rate. In other words, it is taking money from the child care centres to fund its own promotion programs, as it spent $1m on the Medicare promotion program. It is wasting taxpayers' money as, for example, in the expenditure of $7,000 on a desk for the Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. Only last night we had a report from auditors regarding wasteful expenditure under this Government within the Australian Institute of Sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me raise one question for the Government. It has announced an extra $280m for university funding. How did it set the priority between university funding and child care funding? What if the Government had spent $270m extra on university funding and maintained the existing expenditure on child care assistance? The point I make is that the priorities set by this Government are not consistent with the statements it has made and its professed concerns in the area of child care, families and equal opportunity for women.</PARA>
<PARA> The result of the legislation is that the universal subsidy per child care place will be reduced from about $30 to $16 for children under three years of age, or $11 for children three years and over. The average increase in fee will be about $14 a week and the effective rate of Commonwealth subsidy will be halved. The viability of some centres established as a result of Commonwealth policy initiatives will be threatened as a result of this legislation and a particular concern-this is why the honourable member for Melbourne is squirming-is being expressed by the Municipal Association of Victoria, which is threatening not to open new centres because it considers the new arrangements to be a breach of the Commonwealth Government's previous offer. This is a classic and dramatic example of the Government's total failure to consult these organisations properly before rushing into such decisions. It is a matter of particular importance to Victoria. I am sure that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who will follow me in speaking in this debate on behalf of the Opposition, will go into more detail in relation to that matter of real concern.</PARA>
<PARA> Access to high quality child care is one critical factor in achieving equal employment opportunity for women, especially those who need to work because of economic pressure. Yet the Government's action will increase the cost, particularly for middle income families. It is worth bearing in mind that the cost of long day care exceeds that of attendance at the most expensive private day school. The hypocrisy of the ALP's actions in relation to child care and in this measure really highlights the inconsistency in its proclaimed espousal of equal employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> Our policy emphasises provision of quality child care. The Government has promised that some 20,000 new child care places will be established by 1987. These will still provide for only about 7 per cent of Australian children potentially able to use the services. More Australian children still will use commercial child care, more will use informal care, including backyard arrangements, and more will have no access to child care. It is for these reasons that our policy, which was presented before the last election, provided for tax relief for child care expenses. It is appropriate to assist low income families by way of child care subsidy. However, there are many income earning families who will be assisted by that proposal for tax deductibility. Our policy is to provide real assistance to the thousands of families who are disadvantaged under the current tax system. It is quite clear that the current tax system discriminates against single income families in particular. We will assist those families by introducing taxation relief through income splitting arrangements for such families. For that reason I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not waste any time on the farrago of nonsense which we have just heard from the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) which had nothing what ever to do with the Child Care Amendment Bill. Simply because nobody had given him a copy of the second reading speech made by the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) in the other place, the honourable member could not read the Bill and find out what it was about, so we had this mish-mash of total nonsense which is what we have come to expect from the honourable member. I will not waste any more time on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the interesting thing about the child care debate is that there has been considerable discussion about whether quality of care will be maintained under the new funding arrangements. The Government is absolutely firmly committed to quality of care and does provide the highest quality child care that is available. I have received a number of letters which have said that people want to send their children to government funded child care centres because they provide higher quality care than is provided in the private commercial area. I agree with that; that seems to be reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a difficulty with the Municipal Association of Victoria. I think that this is the second time that the MAV has had a go at the Commonwealth Government in an endeavour to demonstrate that it is a powerful and an important organisation. Once again, the MAV has got it totally wrong. On the first occasion this year, it tried to get local government to ask for something which would have given it less rather than greater funding. On this occasion, the MAV is in the business of reducing accessibility to child care. That really is getting a bit beyond a joke. Headlines such as `Child care centre will not open' have appeared in a local newspaper. I ask the House: Who is being used as ammunition in this war between the MAV and the Commonwealth Government? It is the children and the parents who would be using and benefiting from those centres.</PARA>
<PARA> What is it that the local councils say they want? They want a full time director-co-ordinator appointed for every centre, regardless of size, they want $18m worth of full time director-co-ordinators. Think about what that would do to child care funding. They want a 100 per cent coverage for 100 per cent of sick leave entitlements. Nobody budgets for that kind of coverage of sick leave entitlements because it is very unlikely that everybody on a staff will use the total of his or her accumulated sick leave entitlements in any given year. At the moment, 50 per cent of coverage for accumulated sick leave entitlements is part of the annual Budget and that has certainly been satisfactory. Making child care more expensive to support is another way of reducing accessibility to child care.</PARA>
<PARA> The local councils want a guaranteed minimum level of support-straight into the maximum inefficiency area. The Commonwealth Government does not fund child care centres in low need areas. Every one of them is placed in a high need area giving a high rate of usage. They want coverage against possible fluctuation. It is my opinion that good and sensible planning will make sure that there is not a high level of fluctuation in attendance at any child care centre. That is something which the local councils can do something about, seeing they claim such a high level of local knowledge. It seems to me that, given that a centre is placed in a high use area and that good planning will provide a mix of places which will give steady usage, to provide a guaranteed minimum level of support is simply to provide guaranteed funding for inefficient and bad planning, and should a centre eventually be in an area in which the demography has changed it is probably sensible to shift the centre.</PARA>
<PARA> Those three matters, out of a long list of nonsense which the MAV is claiming, are preventing people from using child care centres into which the Commonwealth Government has put a considerable amount of money, as did the local councils when they sponsored organisations. If we gave in to demands such as those we would have deficit funded centres, an open hole down which taxpayers' money would disappear, many fewer centres and instead of child care becoming more accessible it would become less accessible. I ask that the parents demand that their local councils open those centres, stop fiddling around with nonsense that would raise the cost of child care right over the country, and stop using children and their parents as ammunition in their foolish war.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Care Amendment Bill incorporates Labor's $10m worth of cuts to child care centres throughout Australia. The Bill has been rushed in here today following a big fight in Caucus. Presumably the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) got rolled in the Cabinet. The legislation illustrates graphically what a mess this Government is in. I think that it also illustrates graphically how poorly it sets its priorities. The provision of child care facilities has become a growing responsibility of governments over the past few years. The Liberal Party supports government funding essentially to enable parents to have the opportunity to undertake paid employment. In most cases, it is a matter of need and necessity and not choice. For example, contrary to the Government's claims about rich and elitist non-government schools, many parents and particularly mothers, with children at non-government schools have to work to provide what they consider to be the best possible education for their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal Party's approach to funding was one of its main election commitments in 1984 and remains a major plank in our policy. We will provide taxation relief by way of rebate for parents wishing to use child care facilities. Our view is that taxation relief places the spending power in the hands of the individuals. Allied to our policy for child care tax relief, it is important to point out that we have a policy to provide income splitting for families. We strongly support the institution of the family and upon our return to government this will be a major focus of our attention.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we support the general concept of cuts in government expenditure, this measure really shows how wrong the Government's priorities are. This Government has been responsible for throwing money away-taxpayers' money, I might add-with gay abandon. Mr Deputy Speaker, the list of examples of government waste is as long as your arm. It has spent $8m on public funding for election expenses. It gave us extra politicians, as if we did not have enough of them in this place. That costs us $18m a year. Of course, the alterations on the hill to the new Parliament House cost about $40m. Jobs for the boys has been raised to a new art form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is-I know it is hard for the Government to face the facts-that its priorities are wrong. I am simply listing just a few-and there is a very long list-examples of government waste. If it had attacked the waste in the sort of areas that I have highlighted, this measure would not be before the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to another aspect of this matter which particularly concerns me. The Shire of Cranbourne is a municipality in my electorate, on the outskirts of Melbourne, which has a rapidly growing population. To reflect this, it was one of the 42 communities in Victoria to attract government support for a new child care centre. The council received notification in August 1984 that it would receive $175,000 for capital works for a child care centre. It put in $25,000 of its ratepayers' money. It provided the land upon which the building is nearly completed, the land being worth $35,000 to $40,000. The council expects to be in a position to open the centre early next year. The draft operating costs, which square up with the costs of already existing centres, show a total expenditure of about $192,000, of which approximately $160,000 will be taken up by salaries.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the measure that is before the House today, the council resolved last week that it will not open the centre until the Commonwealth reviews its latest decision and provides more significant financial support. Who can blame it? It undertook this project to provide a child care centre for its municipality under certain ground rules that had been set by the Government. Of course, mid-stream, just prior to the centre being opened, the Government has changed the ground rules. The financial effect for the ratepayers of the Shire of Cranbourne is that the subsidy has been cut by $38,000. That is a lot of money. To add insult to injury, the national wage case has increased its costs by $5,500.</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the situation is reflected in 31 of the 42 new centres which were announced in August 1984. I further understand that in Victoria about 1,000 child care centre places are now in jeopardy. The Government has changed the rules midstream and it really makes a mockery of the Government's concern to provide child care facilities. But it is worse than that, because it has led the council up the garden path. It gave firm commitments about recurrent funding and it has now left the council holding the baby. It has all been done without any consultation. It follows what is now a very common occurrence, which is that the Government passes responsibilities to local government, but refuses to come up with the goods for ongoing support. For councils, this will be no surprise. In the May economic statement the Government chopped into their funding yet again when it abandoned the principle that local governments should receive 2 per cent of personal income tax receipts. Following the usual pattern, there was no discussion. For many people in my electorate, this will be the last straw. It will obviously put in jeopardy the 20,000 child care places that the Government promised in the last election and will be yet another in a growing list of broken promises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While many people in society, often typified by those opposite, see non-parental, non-maternal child care as an attack on their rigid nuclear family model, the `keep them barefoot and pregnant' approach, the majority see high quality child care in the provision of family day care, full day or occasional day child care as an integral part of the needs of parents today. While the Opposition generally supports the Child Care Amendment Bill, there is no need whatsoever for this Government or the people of Australia to accept the rubbish that the Opposition has put today in regard to the quality of child care as outlined in this legislation. The record of the Hawke Labor Government on child care, as in many other areas, speaks for itself. The chicken could have done better than the contribution of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter). In fact, I would not be surprised to see him replaced by the chicken if he does not beef up his act a bit after his contribution to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last year of the Liberal-National Party Government it spent $65m on child care. That amount came out of the biggest Budget in real terms and the biggest deficit in real terms that this country has ever seen. Let us compare that measly $65m with the record of the Hawke Labor Government. Today's Opposition will see-and those in the community who make a lot of noise will see-the Government's contribution to real, high quality, high quantity child care. Honourable members should remember that just $65m was spent in the last year of the Liberal-National Party Government, those members of the present Opposition who cry now. In the Hawke Labor Government's first Budget in 1983-84, $80m was spent. Last year $123m was spent-a 53 per cent increase in 12 months. This year, 1985-86, the figure is $133m. For those who can multiply by two-there might be one in the Opposition's ranks who can-that is effectively a doubling in 33 months, an average growth of 28 per cent per annum over that period. So much for the assertions made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Barker that this Bill concerns a $10m cut. It does not concern a $10m cut; it concerns spending $133m this year.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the figures for long day care places, in June 1982, when the previous Government was running the show, there were 37,580 places. In June 1985 the figure was 63,535, an increase of 70 per cent. That is the record. That is what we are talking about and that is what members of the Opposition cannot come to grips with. Furthermore, this Government has a commitment to provide 20,000 new, effective full time child care places by 1988. In 1982 only 4 per cent of the nought to four-year-old age cohort was covered. Now we are covering 7 1/2 per cent. That is the increase. By 1988 the figure will be up to 10 per cent. While not all parents need access to child care, whether it be occasional, short or long day care, the bare fact is that even with this record escalation in the provision of child care services under this Government, more than 90 per cent of children in Australia in that nought to four-year-old age cohort do not have access to high quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem today is this: How do we get the best value for our money to maintain that quality and to increase rapidly the quantity of child care? In answer to that question, this Government has put this legislation before the Parliament today. The honourable member for Chisholm (Ms Mayer) quite capably, as usual, outlined some of the measures taken to ensure that quality keeps pace with quantity. Under the current system, with the Government providing most of its funding by way of operational subsidy for child care centres, there is virtually no incentive for centres realistically to restrain their operational costs. According to what the councils are putting forward, through the Municipal Association of Victoria, they would not accept open-ended funding in their budgets. But that is what they are trying to ram down the throat of this Government. The Opposition would not accept open-ended funding, but that is what it is trying to ram down the throat of this Government. We will not cop it. We want restraint in expenditure while at the same time putting more places on the ground and maintaining quality.</PARA>
<PARA> The funding for child care comes in three parts: Operational subsidy, paid by the Government; fees paid by the parents, and fee relief, paid by this Government as well. Unfortunately since new guidelines were released earlier in the month most people have concentrated on the reduction in operational subsidy without doing the more difficult assessment of changes to the fee relief structure.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not got much time in which to speak; so in the time I have left I want to make a point which has been raised by honourable members opposite. There has been a lot of consultation with the community over a very long period. The child care community knows-it should know and should respect-what this Government has done for child care. I would like to hear a bit more about it from the MAV, from the Opposition and from the community as well. Those people listening to the broadcast today and those people who read the Hansard should be aware of the way in which honourable members on this side are concerned about child care. I refer to the honourable member for Chisholm, who spoke before, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand), the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher), the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), they have fought to develop consultation in the community in order to bring that consultation to the Government. Those honourable members will not have the opportunity to speak here today because of the wasteful speeches of honourable members opposite such as the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Flinders. What a sham! They have not been out there working through the guidelines. We have been working through the community. We have consulted with people in the community. We consulted with the MAV and put its recommendations to the Government. The Government's record on child care speaks for itself. We have never backed down from child care. We will not back down in the future. This legislation proves that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Before I go to the substantive part of my comments I wish to raise very briefly a couple of matters in relation to a matter of privilege referred to by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) this morning. He raised a matter of privilege in relation to some publicity surrounding this report. He indicated that a report in the Age newspaper had adverted to material which had been leaked from Government Committee members. I have had a look at that Age report and it suggests no such thing. Of course, it indicates only that the sources of the leak were Committee members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is the Committee's first since it began effective operations in March this year. Regrettably, the Committee must report to the Parliament that it is unable to fulfil its statutory duty because it does not have-and has been unable to obtain from the National Crime Authority-sufficient information of substance to serve as a basis for the monitoring and review role vested in it by this Parliament. This situation has arisen because of a fundamental difference of view between the Authority and the Committee as to the Authority's obligation to provide information which the Committee believes necessary to carry out its statutory duty. I should emphasise that while the Committee has been active in a number of areas falling within its charter, the subject matter of this first report raises a threshold problem which is of such fundamental significance that it requires immediate attention. The Committee intends to report on its other activities in due course. However, it is unable to discharge its statutory duty effectively until this threshold problem has been resolved. The Committee was established under the National Crime Authority Act 1984 as a result of an amendment inserted in the Act during the Committee stage of the debate in the Senate. The original proposal for such a parliamentary committee was put by Mr Frank Costigan, QC, during evidence he gave before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs inquiring into the National Crime Authority Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like, at this point, to pay tribute to my fellow Committee members and in particular Senator Alan Missen, the Deputy Chairman, for the totally bipartisan way in which they have performed their duties. Given the politically sensitive nature of the Committee's responsibilities and the pecular difficulties which the Committee has faced in its first year of operation, the spirit of co-operation and good will which has prevailed is particularly noteworthy. Also I take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) now, of course, shadow Attorney-General, for his significant contribution to the Committee's operations prior to his resignation. I might add that at least on the part of Government members of the Committee, we wish him a long and fruitful career as shadow Attorney-General. I also thank Mr Chris Fogarty, the Secretary to the Committee, and Miss Nanette Williams for the significant assistance which they have been able to provide to date.</PARA>
<PARA> At the first meeting the Committee had with the Authority I suggested that the relationship between the two bodies was likely to be characterised by an element of `creative tension'. In using this term I was conscious of the potential difficulties inherent in the legislation and indeed in the very nature of the task assigned to this Committee. As with some other legislation, the section of this Act which sets out the duties of the Committee is open to different legal interpretations. As events quickly proved, I was not wrong about the likelihood of an element of tension between the Committee and the Authority. It has arisen precisely because the Authority and the Committee, as I predicted, have taken different views as to the nature of the Committtee's duties under the Act. It remains to be seen whether the role of creativity will be such as to resolve our problem.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's role is unique, as it is the only instance of a parliamentary committee specifically established to act as a watchdog over one statutory authority. This is perhaps a recognition of the seriousness of the issues raised by the need to combat organised crime in this country. These issues require a balancing of the community interest in reducing the grave social and economic effects resulting from organised crime with all the resources it can muster and, of course, a balancing of the protection of individual civil liberties. The unique nature of the Committee's role-and the consequent lack of precedent-has made the Committee's task more than usually difficult. However, throughout what has been a difficult period of operations, the Committee has been fully conscious that it possesses the full range of powers available to a parliamentary committee. The most important of these-the power to send for persons, papers and records-is encompassed within the identical resolutions passed by both Houses at the time of the Committee's establishment. The Committee's role is consistent with the long-established tradition in our parliamentary system of requiring executive and bureaucratic accountability to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament has made a judgment that a joint parliamentary committee is the appropriate body, presumably with the necessary time and resources, to provide detailed oversight of the National Crime Authority. It can only be presumed that the traditional avenue of ministerial accountability was not, by itself, considered adequate to provide detailed supervision of the Authority's operations, particularly having regard to the complex and sensitive issues involved in those operations and the need to ensure that they are properly dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Committee's report relates, evidence of a divergence of view between the Committee and the Authority as to the nature of our relationship and as to the extent of the Committee's powers to seek information was apparent from our first meeting, when the Authority resisted attempts by the Committee to obtain detailed information about the transition from the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> This resistance foreshadowed a general reluctance on the part of the Authority, based upon its interpretation of section 55 and upon its view of its obligations under section 51-the secrecy provision-of the Act, to provide the sort of detailed information about its operations which the Committee regards as necessary if it is to monitor the Authority's operations effectively. When this clear difference of view emerged it was agreed that the Committee should prepare guidelines for the future conduct of proceedings between the Authority and the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> At about this time the Committee had concluded that, in the light of the disagreement about the Committee's right to seek detailed information on the transition from the Costigan Royal Commission, it should seek counsel's opinion on that issue and upon the broader question of the Committee's powers. This opinion, provided by Mr C. M. Maxwell and summarised in the Committee's report, served as the basis of the Committee's proposed guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary form, counsel's view is that there is to be implied from the Act a duty or power to inquire vested in the Committee. This implication is reinforced by a study of the resolutions passed by both Houses relating to the powers and proceedings of the Committee. Among other things, these resolutions specifically empower the Committee to send for persons, papers and records, which is the traditional power of the Parliament to coerce the giving of information as part of its investigative functions. This interpretation is supplemented by paragraph (q) of the resolution, which directs the Committee in carrying out its duties to `ensure that the operational methods and results of investigation of law enforcement agencies as far as possible be protected from disclosure where that would be against the public interest'. This carries a clear implication that the Parliament contemplated that the Committee would be seeking and obtaining from the Authority information relating in some detail to the performance of its functions including any particular decisions made by the Authority in relation to investigation of particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with sub-section 55 (2) of the Act, which seeks to prohibit the Committee from investigating a matter relating to relevant criminal activity or reconsidering the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation, counsel suggests that its purpose was to ensure that the Committee did not usurp or duplicate the Authority's functions. The Authority's role is to investigate; the Committee's role is to monitor and review the way in which the Authority discharges the function of investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the prohibition is to prevent the Committee from making its own judgments as to what the findings in relation to a particular investigation should be. However, this does not mean that the Committee cannot inquire of the Authority what its findings were in relation to a particular investigation and seek to discover the process whereby those findings were arrived at. Counsel suggests the Committee would step beyond its legitimate role if it called for the detailed evidence which served as the basis of the Authority's findings or if it reconsidered what findings it should have reached.</PARA>
<PARA> Another point of difference which arose at the outset and which, I suggest, epitomises the Authority's view of the relationship between it and the Committee is the question of whether there should be a Hansard record of proceedings between the Authority and the Committee. At first, the Committee acquiesced in the Authority's resistance to the presence of Hansard on grounds of security. However, it soon became apparent to the Committee that a verbatim record was essential and, moreover, the Committee is firmly of the view that a Hansard record is a fundamental element of any parliamentary proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA> I should point out, at this stage, that the Authority has subsequently agreed, albeit reluctantly, to the presence of Hansard during Committee proceedings. However, on the fundamental issue of interpretation of the Committee's right to seek additional information to fulfil its statutory duties there has been no meeting of minds. At a meeting on 15 August, where discussion of the issue came to a head, it became apparent that there is a clear delineation of view between the Committee and the Authority on two separate-although interconnected-issues. One is the legal question of the extent to which, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Authority can be required to provide information to enable the Committee to carry out its statutory duty to monitor and review. The second is the perception of the nature of the relationship between a parliamentary committee, vested with all the traditional powers attaching to such committees, and a creature of the Parliament made subject by statute to the scrutiny of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA> At those discussions Mr Justice Stewart, armed with an opinion from the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department in support of the Authority's view, informed the Committee that the Authority believed that it could not properly reveal information to the Committee relating to any relevant criminal activity; that is, any information about any of its investigations. The secrecy provision in section 51 of the Act, which prevents members of the Authority from divulging information, except for the purposes of the Act, is seen by Mr Justice Stewart as conflicting with the right of the Committee to obtain information. Because of the Authority's view of the limits placed on the amount of information it may divulge to the Committee, it has formed the view that to go beyond those limits would place it in breach of section 51.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not doubt the genuine nature of the Authority's perception that to divulge information beyond the limits established by its interpretation of sub-section 55 (2) would put it in breach of the Act's secrecy provision. The Committee is also fully aware of the security implications which may arise from dissemination of information held by the Authority. Nevertheless it is apparent that this Committee cannot fulfil the duty which the Parliament intended without considerably more information than has been formally provided to date. The interpretation of the Committee's powers to which the Authority is committed effectively means that the Committee cannot discharge the duties vested in it by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee accordingly decided that it must report this impasse to the Parliament in order to seek an amendment to the legislation that will ensure that the Committee is properly equipped to undertake the task intended by Parliament. In the Committee's view-and the report contains a recommendation to this effect-the National Crime Authority Act should be amended to make it clear that the Committee has a right of access to the full range of information held by the Authority so as to enable the Committee to monitor and review the Authority's operations effectively.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Committee's recommendation is to seek from the Parliament explicit statutory recognition of, or the removal of any statutory impediment to, the exercise of the full powers of inquiry vested in a parliamentary committee. The Committee is fully aware of the delicate nature of the issues involved and of the consequent need to ensure that the concerns of the Authority regarding security, personal reputations and safety are respected.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I wish to stress the Committee's view that it must be the final arbiter of the extent to which information permissible within the terms of an amendment to the legislation along the lines proposed in the Committee's recommendation ought properly to be provided. In this context the Committee sees as its own responsibility the adoption of procedures consistent with these objectives. Moreover, the Committee wishes to emphasise that powers granted under an amendment of the type proposed would be seen by the Committee as reserve powers and would be used judiciously.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendation seeks an amendment to the Act specifically to provide that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority should have the power to do such things and make such inquiries as it thinks necessary for the proper performance of its duties. The amendment would further provide-this is a very important proposal-that where information sought by the Committee is of such a nature that its disclosure to members of the public would prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operation of law enforcement agencies it should be made the subject of a separate report to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Committee. This latter proposal is modelled on the arrangements in sub-section 59 (3) of the Act dealing with the provision of information by the Authority to the Inter-Governmental Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not make this recommendation lightly. It has given the issues discussed in the report long and serious consideration and has concluded that, unless a recommendation of the sort proposed is forthcoming, there is no point in retaining a parliamentary committee to act as a watchdog over the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue at stake in this report is whether the Parliament is going to assert its right to monitor and review one of its creatures-that is, the National Crime Authority-or whether, for a range of reasons, including a degree of bureaucratic resistance, it will relinquish that role in favour of the traditional model of ministerial accountability alone.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that there is much business before the House. I shall conclude by bringing to the attention of the Parliament one final matter of concern to the Committee. As part of this process, the Committee has been gratified by the ready co-operation it has received from all States and the Northern Territory, with one exception, that exception-this will come as no surprise to many honourable members-being the Premier of Queensland, who, for whatever obscure reason, refused to make the Queensland Police Commissioner available to discuss with the Committee the question of organised crime in his State and the broader issue of co-operation between States and the National Crime Authority. Having regard to the serious level of organised crime in this country and especially to the threat posed to young people by trafficking in narcotics, the Committee finds it inexplicable that any person in high office would refuse to co-operate in the fight against organised crime. I thank the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As a member of the National Crime Authority Committee I endorse the report tabled by the Chairman, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). However, I very much regret his concluding remarks which sought in one way or another to leave this Parliament or anyone who might be listening to the broadcast with the impression that Queensland may not be as active in the fight against organised crime as other States. Indeed, I am advised that the Queensland Police Force has two full time officers with the National Crime Authority. It has extremely good relations with the National Crime Authority. Moreover, a recent conference held as late as Monday of this week conducted by the National Crime Authority in Brisbane resulted in Mr Willey, one of the executive officers, moving a public vote of thanks to Commissioner Lewis of the Queensland Police Force. In that vote of thanks he thanked him for his continued assistance. I understand that Police Commissioner Lewis has extended to members of the National Crime Authority a standing invitation to meet with him at their convenience whenever in Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to correct those last remarks of the Chairman of the National Crime Authority Committee. The fact that Queensland has not made its Commissioner available to the National Crime Authority Committee for the purpose of background information on the trends and the state of organised crime in this country is a matter for a sovereign State. For the Chairman of the Committee in almost his final sentence to leave the issue hanging in the air was in my view quite improper. I simply conclude by saying that all of us well understand the concerns of the National Crime Authority when dealing with a parliamentary committee. After all, the 10 members on the Committee have at least three staff each, so that is 30 staff, and there are then the staff who assist the Committee. Therefore, we can understand its concern. It is necessary for the Committee to build up a trust with the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> This is an area of great interest because in the last few days the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America, for instance, has publicly proclaimed its concern about the Congress Committee overseeing its operations and it expressed the view that that Committee-</PARA>

There is a formula which can be worked out, which is that on matters of great sensitivity, the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman ought to be briefed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to weigh the concerns of the Crime Authority against the need for parliamentary democracy to reign supreme. I accept the advice of one police commissioner to the Committee. He said that certainly there are some risks with giving information to the elected representatives but that the principle of the supremacy of the parliament is worth that risk. If information should leak from that Committee, political sanctions must apply and it is for the Parliament to take action. The leaking of that information, however tragic that may be, is nowhere near as tragic as the lessening of the supremacy of parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Public Service and Statutory Authorities Amendment Bill 1985 has two principal objects. Firstly, it amends the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act to include inefficiency and loss of essential qualifications as grounds upon which redeployment and retirement action can be taken in relation to staff covered by that Act. This amendment is the result of a review of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act in which the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Professional Associations have participated.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act staff can be redeployed or retired where their services cannot reasonably be used because they are surplus to the requirements of their department or authority or are incapable of performing their duties as a result of physical or mental incapacity. The Government believes it essential to have an effective but fair system for dealing with staff who are inefficient or who have lost essential qualifications. Equally, it believes that sub-paragraph 7 (1) (b) (iii) is too broad and imprecise and that a topic so fundamental as the grounds upon which Commonwealth employees can be redeployed or retired should be spelt out in legislation rather than being left to regulations. Accordingly, this legislation repeals sub-paragraph 7 (1) (b) (iii) and specifically inserts inefficiency and loss of essential qualifications into the Act as additional grounds for redeployment and retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> The second principal object of the Bill is to introduce new employment provisions into the Public Service Act. The existing provisions in the Public Service Act have been used to engage staff for several quite different purposes including the engagement of short term and fixed term temporary assistants, the engagement of industrial staff on a continuing basis and the engagement of local staff by Australian missions overseas. The new scheme set out in the Bill will create four separate categories of employees-continuing employees, short term employees, fixed term employees and overseas employees. By separating out these categories, the Bill enables more appropriate engagement and tenure arrangements to apply to each.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions seek to balance the need to give departments greater flexibility in day to day operations while ensuring proper central co- ordination and control to protect the integrity of the new scheme. A special section is inserted into the Public Service Act to facilitate the engagement of staff under the Government's youth traineeship scheme, and other government schemes designed to enable persons to gain skills, qualifications, aptitudes and experience in order to equip them to participate in the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Public Service reforms, the responsibility for human resources budgeting became the responsibility of the Department of Finance. Following this change, it is no longer appropriate for the Public Service Board's approval to be required in relation to consultants engaged by various statutory authorities. Accordingly, the Bill removes the requirement for the Board to approve consultancy arrangements under the various Acts set out in the Schedule to the Bill. The Bill also contains a number of minor technical amendments to the Public Service Act, the Long Service Leave Act and other legislation. Details of these are set out in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no identifiable costs associated with the amendments made by the Bill. The revised employment provisions are designed to ensure that the tenure and other benefits obtained by employees are commensurate with the service they are engaged to provide. The amendments to the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act are expected to improve long term efficiency of the Public Service. The Government proposes to move an amendment relating to departmental annual reports.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That makes it slightly difficult. As the Minister is well aware, it is proposed that the Government will move an amendment to the legislation leading out of the decision in another place to incorporate significant changes to section 10 of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act relating to the provision of annual reports. I do not know whether the Minister referred to that in his remarks, but I have with me, if he would like it, a copy of the Government's proposed amendments to this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been the practice since the introduction of the fairly major legislative reforms to the Public Service introduced by the Government in 1983, the Opposition has seen fit to support the thrust of those proposed amendments because we believe they are consistent with the overall improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Public Service. We have taken every opportunity to emphasise our strong belief in the need to maintain an apolitical Public Service, one which people can enter with the objective of having a career, a Service which they can be proud of and in which they can give the very best service possible to the Australian people and above all a Service that can attract the best quality Australians available to government. I use the term `government' there in a generic sense.</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is introduced to remove a number of anomalies which resulted from the reforms of the Public Service introduced in 1984. Those reforms gave the Public Service Board a somewhat different status in terms of the responsibilities it previously had and they tended to put more emphasis on departmental management and departmental secretaries in particular having greater control over the administration of personnel matters. Again, as I have said, that is quite consistent with our approach that one should try to develop at all possible opportunities a philosophy based on letting the managers manage.</PARA>
<PARA> The new legislation reduces further the Board's involvement in the appointment and termination of non-officer classifications who were not covered by the earlier reforms. These non-officer classifications would include, for example, consultants, technical and industrial personnel under various awards and so forth. But none of these people are defined as officers under the Act. An officer under the Public Service Act, of course, is effectively a career person in the various categories employed within departments. It is proposed that people who come under the new classifications which are included in this legislation will be appointed by secretaries to departments without reference to the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation really has three principal objectives. First, the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act contained a number of grounds upon which public servants could be redeployed or, on occasions, retired from the Public Service. This proposed amendment, which we support, contains additional grounds-namely, inefficiency and loss of essential qualifications. Under the CE(RR) Act, staff can be redeployed or retired where their services cannot reasonably be used because they are surplus to their department's or authority's requirements or are incapable of performing their duties as a result of physical or mental incapacity. As I have pointed out, the Bill extends the grounds for redeployment or retirement, to inefficiency, loss of essential qualifications or for any other reason. In other words, it is proposed that senior management be given substantially greater powers than it had previously over the allocation of personnel in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> Where it is not possible to redeploy an employee, the secretary to a department will be required, under these provisions, to take account of factors such as the nature and duration of the employee's past service, the length of prospective service if he or she stayed in a department and the extent to which retraining or rehabilitation would enable duties to be performed as an alternative to compulsory retirement. I think those provisions are adequate. It means that a person just cannot be dismissed merely on the whim of senior management of a department which should take into account whether in fact that person still has some capacity to offer to either the Department or the Public Service as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> The second objective of the legislation is, as I said earlier, to revise the arrangements applying to the engagement of employees, not officers, under the Public Service Act by establishing four separate categories-that is, continuing, short term, fixed term and overseas employees. It was found necessary to redefine what had previously been known as exempt or temporary employees-mainly staff recruited for part time or temporary work or industrial categories. None of these were previously covered by the Public Service Act and their status under the CE(RR) Act was therefore ambiguous. This resulted in a successful High Court challenge against the Commonwealth in the case Iannou v. Fowell which involved the Special Broadcasting Service. As a result of that it was quite clear that the legislation had to be amended.</PARA>
<PARA> There are currently some 21,000 personnel in the Commonwealth Public Service who are not covered by the full provisions of the Public Service Act and a further 7,000 temporary employees, some of whom in fact do have tenure. The Bill contains a range of definitions in respect of the four new employee categories. It also contains some significant changes in relation to equal opportunity and industrial democracy. Specifically, the objective is to extend to the Naval Defence Act and the Supply and Development Act provisions in earlier legislation which for technical reasons had not been applied to those categories. The Opposition is of the view that this matter should be subject to amendment and I am pleased to see that apparently the Government, on the basis of the amendments given to me by the Special Minister of State, is accepting that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> We have no objection to the extension of the equal opportunity and industrial democracy provisions to civilian personnel under the Naval Defence Act or the Supply and Development Act. However, we were concerned that the legislation was a little open-ended in its present form because in the event of war, civil emergency and so forth there seemed to be a potential limitation on the capacity of personnel under those Acts, and therefore working in a quasi defence role, in fact to come under a greater degree of discipline. However, our concern has been accepted by the Government in the other place and therefore that matter rests.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also take the opportunity to emphasise the concern of the Opposition about allegations that the equal opportunity legislation has been used in such a way that females alone may now apply for positions as acting heads of schools in the Australian Capital Territory. Not unreasonably, the male teacher fraternity feels that it has been unfairly discriminated against. The Opposition has always taken a view that while on the one hand it certainly supports the concept of equal opportunities, whether it be for females, Aborigines, migrants or any other groups in the work force, and it certainly sees that there is a case for us to do what we can to ensure that management does its best to encourage females or other groups in the community to feel, as does the mainstream work force, that they have access to the full range of opportunities, on the other hand we do not solve our problems by creating what can be seen as discrimination against others. If the situation in the Australian Capital Territory is as reported, it is not unreasonable to make the point that male teachers have every reason to feel they are being discriminated against if they are prohibited from taking positions as acting heads of schools simply because they are males. Surely the issue must be that the best person available for the job should fill that position.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the essential ingredients of the Public Service in recent years has been the application of the merit principle. If we are to have a merit principle based on sex, clearly we will have very major problems in a community such as Australia. I think the Government should be prepared to put its somewhat controversial views to one side and try to live with the reality that male teachers are just as entitled to promotion as are female teachers. While a case can be argued that very few female teachers have become heads of departments, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), who is in the chamber, knows as I do as a result of our involvement with the 202nd report of the Public Accounts Committee that the situation has improved quite significantly over the last three or four years. Hopefully we will see a continuing improvement. However, this objective will not be achieved if the work force is divided on the grounds of sex and people are made to perceive that they are not being given opportunities simply because they are males.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has not noted that the Government intends to move the amendment. I take it that he proposes to do so at the Committee stage. I wish to finalise my observations by making two points. Proposed new section 82AD proposes that guidelines should be provided by the Public Service Board for the provision of opportunities for appointments under certain categories. The difficulty as I see it is that there is a weakness under these proposals in that positions will not be advertised. Therefore, I am concerned that the merit principle may not apply. I do not intend to move an amendment in this area because, as I said, there is a problem in giving flexibility to senior management. But I think it is equally important that people in the community should know that these part time jobs are available in the Public Service. Therefore, there is a need to develop a mechanism, whether it be through normal media advertising arrangements or otherwise, to ensure that at least once a year people are made aware that positions are available and that they can apply for them.</PARA>
<PARA> The second observation I make is in relation to the employment of fixed term employees. In my opinion there is a contradiction in the legislation in the definition of fixed term employees who, as I stated, may be appointed by the secretary to a department with the approval of the Public Service Board to perform duties involving a project or task with a fixed duration. Such appointments may be made if the required skills are not present in the Public Service and the appointee will not be required on the completion of the project. In other words, the distinct impression from that definition is that it is for a specific period. Unfortunately, proposed section 82AE does not state that. What it says is that a departmental head may appoint a person for a period not exceeding five years. But there is also provision for a further extension of five years without reference to the Public Service Board. Frankly, it is absurd to suggest that a part time person can have a job for 10 years, especially in categories where they will not be available for promotion or in most cases for the fringe benefits, of which honourable members, including the Special Minister of State (Mr Young), are well aware. That area requires further examination.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee stage in due course I may refer to other questions relating to equal opportunity and industrial democracy, but on that point I would emphasise that the Opposition is happy to support the legislation in its present form, but we will not support the Government's proposal to amend section 10 relating to secretaries and annual reports.</PARA>

<PARA>I am pleased that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), had been circulated with the amendments. They have been redrafted in deference to the amendments put up by the Australian Democrats, as I understand, in the Senate. The Government is moving an amendment which accepts the general principles of the Australian Democrats amendment passed by the Senate, that is, that departments be required to report annually to the Parliament, but hopefully we have redrafted it in a more acceptable form.</PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment retains proposed sub-clauses 25 (6) and (8) of the Democrats amendment, that is, the obligation of the secretary to a department to prepare an annual report and the obligation upon the Minister responsible for a department to table such a report in the Parliament within 15 sitting days. We are deleting the long list of detailed contents included in proposed sub-clause 25 (7) and replacing it by a requirement that such a report be in accordance with guidelines approved by the Prime Minister and tabled in the Parliament. This gives a statutory basis to present practice. It thus puts a statutory obligation on the Executive to report to the Parliament while at the same time allowing flexibility in developing the guidelines over time to meet the Parliament's information needs.</PARA>
<PARA> We are inserting a new sub-clause 25 (9) to make it clear that the annual report requirement applies only to departments of state or ministerial departments, not those statutory authorities such as the Ombudsman which are deemed to be departments for the purpose of the Public Service Act and which already, in most if not all cases, are subject to annual reporting requirements in the Acts setting them up. I hope that the clarification contained in the redrafting of the Government's amendments will meet with the Opposition's support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, the Opposition is not able to support the proposed reversal of the situation which the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) has emphasised. I would emphasise that in the Australian Labor Party's policy for the 1983 election there was a considerable section to the effect that it wanted to introduce in this House a Bill to establish an annual report procedure. I do not know why the Government is so coy about this matter because it is contained in Labor's policy statement. I put to the Minister two simple propositions. First, if the Government is prepared to support a private member's Bill which could have unanimous support within the chamber containing elements supported and agreed to by both sides, that would be an alternative worthy of serious consideration. All I am stating is that it happens to be the common policy of both the Government and the Opposition that there be in place an adequate mechanism by which departments will make annual reports to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are in place, now, through the Acts Interpretation Act provisions, arrangements by which statutory authorities must make annual reports to the Parliament, but for some odd reason they do not yet apply to departments. The provision, which both the amendment as well as the existing legislation as it has come to us from another place specifies without doubt, is that the secretary to a department shall as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year prepare and furnish to the Minister administering the department a report on the operation of the department during the year that ended 30 June. I am pleased that the Government has not seriously contemplated removing that provision because that would be gross and totally contrary to government policy. However, one goes to the substance of the amendment. I am now told the position-very late in the piece, I would add, having had absolutely no discussions with the appropriate Minister in another place because at no stage has he ever wanted to talk to me about these matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but I have had no discussions with the Minister at any stage since I have taken over responsibility on these matters. The point is that the Government apparently has in place a number of reforms that we will have to examine in due course on their merits. I hope that they are satisfactory, though I doubt many of them will be. The point is that I am unaware of those reforms because nobody has ever bothered to discuss the matter with me. In light of that, and with the support of the Australian Democrats, we have gone ahead and put in place a set of amendments which are essentially based on the Carrick provisions contained in the existing guidelines. There are no regulations in this chamber relating to annual reports. There is only a set of guidelines which I understand are currently being reviewed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal contained in our amendments, supported in another place by the Democrats as well as by the Opposition parties, simply requires that, among other things, revenue and expenditure of departments, including expenditure and revenue arising from trading activities or cost recovery activities during the year be reported upon in a form giving a true and fair impression of the activities of that department. In other words, it is just not good enough to say one prepares estimates of expenditure and puts forward supplementary documentation in terms of the Budget debate, but rather that in the annual report there should be a statement at the back-a comparative document which people could read and understand-as to where the funds which have been allocated by the Parliament to that department are going. It is not just a document for the Parliament. It is supposed to be a document for the community to be able to read and understand.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we recommended the implementation and operation of industrial democracy plans in departments should be contained. That is not very profound. Again, it is Labor Party policy. I find difficulty in understanding why the Government is now asking for that to be removed. We went on to suggest that the number of officers in each classification employed in departments during the year should be noted. The argument is that there are too many classifications, and it is all too hard. One of the weaknesses in public administration in this country-and I am sure that the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) will agree with me-is that for too long the Parliament has allowed itself to be confused by a bureaucratic tendency to give out as little information as possible. In view of the other amendments contained in this Bill relating to those new four or five categories of non-permanent officers, there is a very good reason why the Parliament should know whether departments are building up an unfair or unreasonable balance between career officers and non-career officers within the department. If one is to wait on the Public Service Board to come up with the evidence, one might wait for a long time. Under new arrangements introduced by this Government it is the Department of Finance that now controls personnel budgeting, not the Public Service Board. Essentially, it is up to departments which are supposed to have a degree of independence to be able to put in their annual reports this essential information which is relevant to the manner in which they have conducted their activities.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition there is another provision that seeks to find out under what conditions people who were previously employed by departments have been dismissed. Again, that is not unreasonable because the record in recent years, if one accepts a Public Service Board report, is extraordinary. I think that last year three people were dismissed from the Public Service for either inefficiency or other somewhat gross activities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, three. It is incredible. I think that we need to know on a departmental basis precisely how management handles its personnel structure. In addition, we have suggested that the number of persons engaged by secretaries as consultants during the year be reported upon, and that their qualifications and experience and the purpose for which they are engaged be mentioned. The only argument against that I have heard is that nobody can define what a consultant is. All I can say is that that is rather odd. I am sure that with the enormous amount of brainpower in the Public Service Board and elsewhere, it is possible to define what a consultant ought to be. If one cannot define what a consultant ought to be, why on earth are we arguing about these four categories which are now going into legislation in this Bill? One of those categories is meant to cover the question of consultants. Because of the time restraints I do not want to hold up the chamber, but if the chamber wishes to divide on this-it is our intention to do so-I want it to be quite clearly understood that we are prepared to discuss these issues if the Minister wishes to make the time available to me. But at this stage I see no case which has been adequately presented as to why the original provisions in this amendment should not be carried by the chamber as they were in the other place. After all, the objective is to give the electorate and the community at large more information as to the stewardship of departmental management.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his perceptive and relevant question. As the leadership of the Opposition is involved in the analysis that has been undertaken by this overseas firm, it is appropriate that I should refer to the fact that this Leader of the Opposition has fast acquired a reputation for doing nothing more than trying to talk his country down. This is not new; it goes back to the time of the election campaign in February of 1983. I remind members of this House that on 10 February 1983, in invoking international judgments about this country, Mr Howard had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that if they-</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Labor Party's economic policies-</PARA>
<PARA>are implemented in Australia our international economic reputation will be affected and, so far from instilling that private sector business confidence which in theory everybody agrees is necessary, I believe it would have the opposite effect.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the bloke who is now the Leader of the Opposition, speaking in February of 1983. He was saying that there was going to be an international judgment about Australia if this great Party's economic policies were applied. Of course, he was wrong in February 1983 because with the implementation of our economic policies we gradually pulled this country out of the economic morass into which his mismanagement had placed it. But of course he was not satisfied with that. Having been wrong in February of 1983 he continued to try to talk down the economy of this country. At the beginning of 1984 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic growth will peter out by the end of 1984.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong again! We are now in 1985, and still he has done nothing but be the whingeing Johnny of the Australian political scene. He has got to the pathetic stage now where, in an interview with Steketee of the Sydney Morning Herald, assailed as he is on all sides by those who are seeking to dethrone him, he actually says: `Look, my leadership will be saved by an economic recession next year'. Whingeing Johnny Howard is trying to talk his country down. I am here to tell whingeing Johnny Howard that he will not get his hoped for recession.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the New York risk analysis firm of Frost and Sullivan yesterday upgraded its investment rating of Australia. The firm gives Australia the highest possible rating when assessing the risk facing people transferring money into a country. Australia has been upgraded from B to A1 since the last report in December 1984, putting it alongside the United States, Hong Kong and Holland in the 85 countries surveyed. Australia's rating as a political risk for direct investors and as a reliable customer for United States exporters has also risen. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition gets a mention but, as one would imagine, not a very honourable mention. The report notes:</PARA>
<PARA> The economy is growing at a modest rate and the Opposition lacks strong leadership.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that there have been two recent tests, the most recent of 50 kilotons. I am also aware that there has been an estimated aggregate yield of about 250 kilotons in the course of this year. What must be recognised is that it is reasonable to assume that there is a finite limit to the punishment Mururoa Atoll can absorb. For this reason alone, France should conduct its tests on its home territory and not ask others to assume this risk. This is particularly so if, as the French claim, the tests are conducted in absolutely safe conditions. Office of National Assessments technical assessments show that the geological strata in parts of France are such that the tests could be conducted there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is wrong, as the French have claimed on some occasions, that a scientific assessment of Mururoa Atoll in 1983 established that the testing program was not damaging to the environment. In fact, the study did not give those tests a long term environmental bill of health. The Economist magazine, scarcely a radical publication, in October wrote that the French only bred distrust when they ignored the critical parts of the report of these scientists and claimed it vindicated them completely.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the other part of the question the honourable member asked, I think it would be unfortunate if it were decided, if I can say so with good humour, to test a nuclear weapon under the Eiffel Tower. I believe 1989 is the centenary of the construction of the Eiffel Tower. While I am not aware of the purpose for which the map to which the honourable member referred was drafted, what is more important are the boundaries of the nuclear free zone of the South Pacific, the subject of a treaty which was concluded at the last meeting of the South Pacific Forum countries. The program was initiated, sustained and brought to a successful conclusion by the energies and the commitment of the Prime Minister, and we look forward to that treaty being signed and ratified by member countries of this region and hope that the nuclear powers become depositories to the treaty.</PARA>

It is important to point out to the House whether the information given in this letter is accurate according to the Act, and I will do that for honourable members. It is an appeal letter which purports to go out from the Liberal Party in Melbourne to, I suppose, business people and others who might be interested in supporting the Party. Labor members of parliament have received it. The last page is headed `The Liberal Party of Australia, Victorian Division, Challenge Fund, Robert Menzies House, 104 Exhibition Street, Melbourne 3000'. It goes through a whole range of things. It says the Party needs some support because, according to the person who signed this letter, it is opposed to the capital gains tax and has a commitment, as soon as Mr Howard becomes Prime Minister, to repeal it. It should be well entrenched by then. I do not think the next generation of Australians will be that worried about it. The letter goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is one ingredient needed to avoid this-your support now and whenever appropriate, until the electors make their decision. The nation will suffer if the Liberal Party is ill prepared to mount a strong election challenge.</PARA>
<PARA> That's why I've enclosed a Liberal Challenge Fund contribution slip, and that's why I'm now asking for an investment in the future in the form of a gift to this fund of $30, $100 or more if you can.</PARA>
<PARA> I realise . . . the time may not be intirely suitable to ask for your contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>I take it from the Leader of the Opposition that he knows something about it. I suggest to him that it might not be the most appropriate time. What I would do if I were he and sending out a letter like this would be to wait until July 1987, when those people who are paying 60c in the dollar now will get their massive tax cuts, bringing their payments down to 48c in the dollar, and those paying 46c in the dollar will have their payments reduced to 40c in the dollar. There will be a lot more money in the community for political donations. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> But there's no other way the Liberal Party can mount a strong campaign, other than with your generous support.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a bit of `mirror, mirror on the wall' on the back page:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Should the Liberal Party toughen further its stance on militant trade unions?</PARA>
<PARA>Mirror, mirror on the wall. The second question is:</PARA>
<PARA> Will the introduction of the Labor Government's Capital Gains Tax affect you and your family?</PARA>
<PARA>At least it explains why the coalition has no policies; it is waiting for an answer to its campaign letter. As soon as it gets in it will be able to say: `Well, 4,000 voted yes and 2,500 voted no'. The important feature of the answer is that alongside where people were to put their name, their company address and so forth and the amount of the donation, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Gifts to the Liberal Party Challenge Fund will not be subject to the disclosure requirements of either Federal or State legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the correspondence to which the honourable member referred. The fact is that the Transport Workers Union has been made well aware of the Government's view of this matter. Some two weeks ago it was told quite clearly by me that the Government could not support industrial action in respect of a superannuation scheme and would not support any superannuation scheme coming into existence prior to the conclusion of the productivity case and not in accordance with that productivity case unless there were special and isolated circumstances, and any such circumstances would have to have regard to the national wage fixing principles, particularly principle 11 which refers to negligible cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those elements have been known by the Transport Workers Union for some time. The situation is that that union has been having some consultations with companies. Today I met with the Australian Road Transport Federation. I understand that the position of the companies is in line with that of the Government; that is, they will await the special and isolated circumstances clarification from the union. When they receive that they will be able to make some decision about how they view the claim. That is also the position of the Government at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the latter part of the honourable member's question, let me say that the prices and incomes accord in no way opens the door for the kind of action which he put forward in his question. It most certainly does not give an invitation to industrial action. The Prime Minister and I made it quite clear yesterday that the Government does not support industrial action in regard to superannuation; there is no need for such industrial action. The fact is that a strategy has been agreed by the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions as to how superannuation should be extended in the community. That strategy involves a productivity case and arguing in that productivity case for a particular outcome and for that outcome to be taken in the way of superannuation-both extension and improvement.</PARA>
<PARA> That is an agreed position to which we are committed and which we will pursue. It is a very responsible position. It is in no way economically irresponsible. It means that the distribution of productivity gains to employees, which has not occurred for some years, will occur in a way which will be taken by way of superannuation and extended over a two-year period. The implementation of that productivity case outcome over a two-year period would be absolutely unique in the annals of arbitration in this country. At the same time to rope in the superannuation area, which has always run quite free of wages policy in this country, is also a major achievement in terms of wages policy and economic control in this country. Those matters should be thoroughly understood by those people who are being critical at present. The Government is gaining control of a major on-cost which, under the previous Government, was in no way controlled and operated totally outside of wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say to the House that during the period of the Fraser Government not only did we see an explosion of wages at various times, particularly in 1982 when there was a 17 per cent increase, but also we saw a continual expansion of superannuation with the proportion of the work force which received superannuation moving from 32 per cent to 45 per cent. An additional 800,000 employees received superannuation. That occurred totally outside any form of wages policy. That type of thing is coming to an end. Wages policy is going to encompass superannuation in a way which is totally economically responsible and which will mean that the distribution of productivity gains to employees occurs in that way instead of by way of a wage increase. That is a thoroughly commendable outcome and demonstrates, once again, the great importance to this nation of the prices and incomes accord.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since difficulties arose with natural human growth hormone at the beginning of this year, the Government has sought both a replacement from overseas and the development of a substitute here in Australia. As I informed the House some three weeks ago, the Government has achieved access to a biosynthetic substitute from Sweden which will be made available next month to those in the program. However, as I pointed out to the House, that biosynthetic substitute costs about 10 times as much as the natural growth hormone. Therefore, we are very interested in developing an Australian substitute. I am not able to be precise at this moment, but we hope that an Australian substitute will be available during 1986 at a considerably cheaper cost.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not quite hear part of the honourable gentlemen's question. I understand he was referring to the closer economic relations agreement which this Government negotiated. The differences between our two countries in terms of that agreement relate to getting a neutral position with respect to protection and subsidisation. The things that we cannot take into account are relative exchange rate variations. That was never in the agreement and it is impossible, of course, to put it into any movement to free trade. This Government takes the view that we cannot very well lecture the world, as did the previous Government, about the evils of protection and subsidisation and what that does to agricultural trade, yet at the same time not come to an accommodation with New Zealand on fair, unsubsidised trade between the two countries. We are trying to get between our two countries a basis whereby any subsidisation, any assistance for identical industries, is phased out on the same level, the same rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In cases where real problems are growing up with respect to industries on both sides of the Tasman, this Government has found, as did the previous Government-it put in place the joint arrangement on dairy products-that industry consultations are a far better way to try to solve the problem. At present the exchange rate variation between our two countries is very favourable to us. One of the big problems, of course, is that there is identical ownership of firms on both sides of the Tasman, and this poses real problems. In respect of vegetables, particularly in regard to the firm of Watties and the amount of money that it is expending at present by way of export promotion, the Minister for Trade and I took up that matter with the New Zealand ministerial delegation when it was here recently. The Ministers said that they would give it attention, as they would the other element that is causing trouble-that is, export-import licensing, the so-called EALs, which are exclusive Australian licences. The Minister for Trade and I are giving both those matters the closest attention. But I think many of the problems are purely commercial and purely in terms of comparative advantage rather than subsidisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the Opposition is obviously sensitive about such a question. In answer to the honourable member, in the most unlikely event of Mr Olsen having to honour this promise-as is the case in regard to most of his other promises-the doctors would have to be paid from the South Australian public purse. If Mr Olsen wished to spend this money, he would be free to do so. If he wanted to give a windfall income gain to country doctors, he would have to pay for it out of the South Australian public purse. My own view would be that this amount of money could be spent much more wisely and sensibly on other South Australian health services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The responsibility for paying doctors for services delivered to public patients in public hospitals has always been a State responsibility. Varying States have paid varying fees for those services. However, for many years, all States have discounted the schedule fee for the obvious reason that all of the doctors' supporting services provided in the hospital are paid for already by the taxpayer. For example, the public hospital does the billing and accounting procedures. For all those reasons, every State has discounted the schedule fee in its payment to hospital doctors. I also point out that the offer made by Dr Cornwall, the present, and no doubt the continuing, Minister for Health in South Australia, to pay 90 per cent of the schedule fee, is the most generous offer made by any State government to hospital doctors in any State in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is quite an important question; I would like to be able to answer it. The increase in tourism from Japan is exactly as the honourable member described it. That increase is despite several difficulties. Firstly, I refer to the difficulty in getting more aeroplane seats between Australia and Japan. I guess it is fair to note that the Minister for Aviation has approved some charter flights into Cairns by All Nippon Airways. Of course, there are difficulties in getting the Japanese Government to agree to increase flights to and from Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other inherent difficulties in coping with Japanese tourism and the expectations of Japanese tourists. I think probably it is realistic to relate the instance of the increase in Japanese tourism to Europe 20 years ago. When the Japanese started to go to Europe in large numbers they were disappointed to find that the accommodation was not up to scratch, there were difficulties in obtaining Japanese-speaking guides; in fact, there were all sorts of inherent difficulties that made life difficult for non-English speaking tourists.</PARA>
<PARA> We are very concerned that as this increase in tourism from Japan continues-it has increased by 50 per cent this year-we will be able to cope with the expectations of these tourists. It is pleasing to note the huge increase in investment in Australia by Japanese interests in the provision of hotels. Of course, in Queensland we now have two hotels financed on the Gold Coast by Japanese interests. We now have three hotels in Sydney being financed by Japanese interests. All around Australia there are hotels being set up especially to cater for Japanese visitors.</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand the Iwasaki project on the Queensland coast at Yeppoon, it is to open in March. I had a visit from Mr Iwasaki this week. He has given me an unequivocal assurance that the first 100 rooms will open in March, and that the number will be increased as the year goes on.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have liked to be able to tell the honourable member for Fadden that our proposed program of advertisements featuring Paul Hogan in Japan this year had gone ahead. However, we were advised not to advertise. It appears that although Hogan will be just as successful in Japan as he was in the United States the great increase in the number of Japanese who will want to come to Australia as a result of those advertisements will mean that those Japanese will have great difficulty in finding plane seats. This year there has been an increase of 83 per cent in the number of plane seats available on flights between Australia and Japan. However, it is still not enough to cope with the expectations of people who will want to come.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a fairly healthy comment on tourism in Australia that we have a market in Japan ready to exploit but are not yet able to do so. I hope that we can exploit that within the progress of the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA> To answer the honourable member's original question, there will be a large increase in the funds available for the promotion of tourism from Japan; secondly, there will be more plane seats available and, by that time, the infrastructure will be in place in Australia to cope with those Japanese tourists to make their stay very enjoyable.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I must mention that the presidents of the 14 largest Japanese travel agencies have been in Australia in the last month as guests of the Australian Tourist Commission. They have had a tour from Perth to Cairns. I had a meeting with them in Sydney. I must say they were absolutely delighted, first of all with the attitude expressed to them-not on any official basis-by people working in hotels, restaurants and shops which they visited unofficially, in terms of welcoming Japanese visits. I think that is a manifestation of Australia's welcome towards Japanese.</PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the xenophobia we had seems to have disappeared. They were welcomed with open arms. Those people went home very satisfied that in fact Australia is the coming destination for Japanese tourists. I can assure honourable members that we will be doing all we can to see that the huge market up there awaiting exploitation will in fact be treated in that way.</PARA>

The Nella Dan is now 30 tonnes of fuel light on what it needs to get back. Therefore, it will be necessary to transfer fuel in very difficult seas from the Icebird to the Nella Dan.</PARA>
<PARA> The Icebird is due to reach the 10-kilometre wide iceflow where the Nella Dan is trapped in Amundsen Bay some time tomorrow morning eastern summer time. The Icebird is currently 120 nautical miles north of Nella Dan's position. It is currently moving through the pack ice at about half speed, that is, at about 7 knots.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) has tabled a statement in support of the ratification of the two International Labour Organisation conventions. The Minister spoke glowingly in his statement which he tabled today about Convention 150 which calls for what is referred to as a co-ordinated system of labour administration which is based on consultation, co-operation and negotiation between public authorities and the most representative organisations of employers and of workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of that he gives another hurrah for the prices and incomes accord. It is quite obvious from reading the statement and from looking at the history of the Government that so far as the prices and incomes accord is concerned both the Government and, in particular, the Minister know nothing about consultation, co-operation and negotiation on industrial matters. It is a complete sham to pretend that it is interested in any of this. What it is really interested in is not so much the consultation, co-operation and negotiation which the International Labour Organisation talks about, but what it is interested in really and what it actively promotes is to allow the trade union movement to manipulate events and bludgeon concessions out of employers to the long term detriment of this country. There can be no real negotiation-and it is negotiation that the ILO conventions talk about-when the Government gives the game away by entering into the accord in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA> It was, we say, an abandonment of all national responsibility for the Government to give away the September national wage case in advance, to give away the April 1986 national wage case in advance, and to give away the productivity case as in fact it has done. So, it is not interested in negotiations. It is interested in fixes and it is interested in rigging to get concessions for the unions which, frankly, this country cannot afford. But we believe that its most shameful failure to live up to this lofty principle of negotiation, which is espoused by the International Labour Organisation and which is said to be promoted by the Minister today, is its disgraceful performance over superannuation which we have seen over the last few days.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, instead of setting up a framework for negotiation, which the ILO speaks of so far as superannuation is concerned, is setting up a framework for some new generation of Jimmy Hoffas who are going to get control over millions of dollars of assets in this country, millions of dollars of funds which workers themselves are entitled to and which will, of course, be used to advance the interests of the unions. In fact, the Government is allowing at least three things to happen. First, it is allowing and in fact encouraging some trade unions to get their hands on millions of dollars.</PARA>

We have asked the Leader of the House (Mr Young) that in respect of each of them there be a motion that the House take note of them. I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to page 533 of Pettifer's House of Representatives Practice where it refers to the practice that when statements are made by the Government there be an opportunity for a response by the Opposition. Some of the statements to be made certainly canvass procedures that will be before the House next year. I seek from the Minister an assurance that in those instances, where there are statements that relate to matters of concern to the Opposition-for example, there is one from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) regarding the conduct of Australian companies with interests in the Republic of South Africa-there will be a debate. I understand the time constraints. However, given that the matters are to be adjourned for the time being, I ask that wherever possible there be an opportunity for some response in this Parliament because they are matters of fairly wide public concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REPORTS</PARA>
<PARA>House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs</PARA>
<PARA> 1. ASBESTOS MINING EFFECTS ON THE BARYULGIL COMMUNITY-TABLED 9.10.84.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been detailed consultation with the New South Wales Government on the proposals to implement many of the recommendations of the report. The government is shortly to consider the outcome of this consultation and will respond as quickly as possible after that.</PARA>
<PARA>Joint Standing Committee on Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA> 1. RETAIL TRADING HOURS IN THE ACT-TABLED 21.10.82; INTERIM RESPONSE 15.12.83; FINAL RESPONSE TABLED 21.11.85</PARA>
<PARA> 2. PARLIAMENTARY ZONE DRAFT DEVELOPMENT PLAN-TABLED 1.3.84</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee on the ACT in its report of March 1984 on the draft Parliamentary Zone Development Plan, prepared by the National Capital Development Commission, gave ``in-principle'' approval to the proposals contained in the draft Plan.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish however to inform Honourable Members that in May 1984 the Government considered the Development Plan for the Parliamentary Zone and decided that it provided a suitable basis for submission to the relevant Parliamentary Committees for approval of proposals for the Mall, Watergate and lake foreshore, access roads and lighting under the Parliament Act 1974 and the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910.</PARA>
<PARA> As appropriate opportunities arise the Mall area has been considered as a suitable location for buildings of national or governmental significance having appropriate architectural merit. The Development Plan has been refined and further developed by the NCDC to incorporate the proposed national Archive and Exposition, various Bicentennial commemoration proposals and associated roadworks.</PARA>
<PARA> The NCDC will shortly be bringing forward a revised Development Plan for the Parliamentary Zone for the Government's consideration as a prelude to submission to the relevant Parliamentary Committees for their consideration and report to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements will also be made to ensure that, as the Joint Committee on the ACT has requested, all Members and Senators have an opportunity to examine the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> A final response to the Committee's report will be made after the Government has considered the revised Development Plan.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. THE MURRUMBIDGEE RIVER IN THE A.C.T. REGION-TABLED 11.9.84-RESPONSE TABLED 28.11.85</PARA>
<PARA>House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation</PARA>
<PARA> 1. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION-ADEQUACY OF LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS-2ND REPORT TABLED 27.10.81</PARA>
<PARA> A response is nearing completion and is expected to be presented to the House in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE, TRANSPORT AND DISPOSAL-1ST REPORT TABLED 29.4.82</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has initiated consultations with the wide range of interested parties concerned with disposal of hazardous wastes. Following a national conference on 19-20 November 1985 which the Commonwealth co-sponsored, it is proposed that a response to the first report will be finalised for presentation early in the Autumn 1986 Sittings of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. 2ND REPORT TABLED 9.12.82-The Government is currently considering proposals for a national chemicals notification and assessment scheme, a matter which was central to this Parliamentary Committee report. When this is finalised a response to the report will be provided.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. BUSHFIRES AND THE AUSTRALIAN ENVIRONMENT-TABLED 4.10.84</PARA>
<PARA> A response to the Report has been finalised and, will be presented to the House in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. PROTECTION OF THE GREATER DAINTREE-TABLED 24.8.84</PARA>
<PARA> Protection of the Greater Daintree area is being dealt with by the Government in the broader context of developing a rainforest conservation policy for Australia. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment established a Working Group to advise him on the development of a Commonwealth Rainforest Conservation Policy. The Working Group reported to the Minister and recommended a comprehensive and flexible package to promote rainforest conservation. The Minister has sought the views of relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers and non-government organisations on the Report and has made it available for public comment. Based on the Report and comments received the Minister will shortly bring forward proposals for rainforest conservation for consideration by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. PROTECTION OF BUNGLE BUNGLE-TABLED 28.3.85</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government carried out a separate inquiry into the conservation status of the Bungle Bungle area. A necessary first step in formulating the Commonwealth Government's response to the Standing committee Report is to seek the views of the Western Australian Government on the nature and timing of any decisions following from the State inquiry, and on the recommendations of the Standing Committee. The Prime Minister has written to the Premier of Western Australia concerning these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (IMPACT OF PROPOSALS) ACT 1974-TABLED 24.5.85</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is expected to respond in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. PROTECTION OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF-TABLED 12.11.85</PARA>
<PARA> Response to be made in the 1986 Autumn Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA>House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA> 1. ACCOMMODATION AND HOME CARE FOR THE AGED-TABLED 28.10.82-FOLLOW UP REPORT TABLED 10.10 84</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will recall that on 13 July 1984 I announced the establishment of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee, chaired by Her Honour Judge Robyn Layton. The Committee also included Dr David Formby and Dr George Repin representing the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brian Shea representing the States and Territories and Dr Ron Wells and Dr John Donovan who shared representation from the Commonwealth Department of Health. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee for the considerable time spent and diligence displayed in preparing this comprehensive report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first report of the Review Committee addresses item 2 of the terms of reference and deals with matters relating to the content, format, and structure of the medical benefits schedule. The report was submitted to me by the Chairperson of the Committee, Judge Layton, on November 7 this year, with a request that it be tabled and distributed as soon as possible. I have accepted this suggestion as many recommendations of the Committee are of importance to the general community and the medical profession. The full recommendations of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee will be considered by the Government following the receipt of the Committee's second report, which is expected to be finalised in the first half of 1986. Many of the 67 recommendations contained in this report have significant financial implications, which will require consideration in the 1986 Budget process. This will have to take account of the continuing need for reasonable restraint in government expenditures. To this end the implementation of some recommendations outlined in the report is likely to be dependent on other offsetting reductions in medical benefits expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I can indicate to the House that those recommendations concerned with improving and streamlining administrative procedures will receive a high priority. For example, recommendations 14, 15, 16 and 17 deal with the system of referral of patients to medical specialists. The early implementation of these recommendations will benefit both patients and medical practitioners. Recommendation 26 concerning financial assistance to rural Australians for travel and accommodation costs incurred while seeking in-vitro fertilisation treatment at IVF centres in capital cities has already been implemented by my department. Financial assistance is currently provided to patients in these circumstances through the isolated patients travel and accommodation assistance scheme IPTAAS. I am also sympathic to the recommendations of the Committee on improving the format and structure of the medical benefits schedule book. My department is engaging a printing consultant to advise on these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Medicare Benefits Review Committee is now proceeding with its second report which addresses item 1 of the terms of reference, that is, consideration of the extension of the Medicare arrangements to provide benefits for certain paramedical services. Following receipt of that report, the Government will be in a position to consider in detail the total package of recommendations. I commend the first report of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee to honourable members.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Barker)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) said that the Medicare Benefits Review Committee was set up in July 1984. The Minister had hoped that he would get a report from the Committee which would give him some justification to cut funding for medical benefits. The report in fact does not provide him with that support. Rather, it proposes a number of changes to the structure of the medical benefits schedule which, according to the Minister, will have significant financial implications. As a result of the Government's policy to encourage universal bulk billing, there has been an explosion in the cost of health care delivery in this country and, in particular, in medical benefits. The Budget indicates that this year medical benefits expenditure will increase by over 11 per cent and will involve an expenditure of some $2,250m. The forward estimates indicate that next year the rate of growth in expenditure will increase further to 14.8 per cent. The increase this September quarter compared with the previous September quarter was 16 per cent. So we can see that the rate of growth of expenditure on medical benefits has been very great under this Government's Medicare package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The very great degree of growth in medical benefits expenditure has meant that the Government has had to cut expenditure in other areas. It has had to cut public hospital funding to the great disadvantage of all of those who are now reliant on Medicare and have to join a queue to get into public hospitals. The Opposition is concerned about the way in which the Government will implement the propositions contained in the report. The Government is concerned about the significant financial implications of the report. The Minister said that the Government would have to take account of the continuing need for reasonable restraint in government expenditure. He went on to say that the Government will be looking at other offsetting reductions in medical benefits expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> Only this weekend members of the Press started to pick up the Government's concern, based on the forward estimates, about the growing expenditure on medical benefits. It was suggested at the weekend that the Government may well reconsider the option which was presented by Senator Walsh in the lead up to this year's Budget-that is, a reduction in the 85 per cent payment for items on the medical benefits schedule. In other words, it was suggested that there be a further reduction by the Government in payments for services rendered by doctors from 85 per cent to Senator Walsh's proposal of, I think, 75 per cent. It is quite clear that that is one of the issues that are now under consideration by the Minister for Health, and that is of real concern to us, the medical profession and Australians generally.</PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time today we heard about the concern that is being expressed by South Australian country doctors who are very worried about the cuts they have suffered in their salaries as a result of Medicare. They now have to take 85 per cent of the cost of items on the medical benefits schedule instead of 100 per cent which they used to get. This has happened because people have given up private insurance as they were encouraged to do by the Minister for Health under his Medicare arrangements. Dr Blewett now comes into this place and says: `Why should they not take a 15 per cent cut in their salaries? We expect them to do so under Medicare and if John Olsen, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, is going to reimburse them for that cut in their salaries, he should not come to the Federal Government for the money to pay for that reimbursement.' This is a classical example of the Minister's socialist ideas. He believes that people such as doctors ought to take cuts in salaries for doing the work that they have always undertaken. He sees no reason why they should not have a cut in salary. In fact, he would prefer that they be employed by the Government on a salary.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the continuing growth in medical benefits expenditure is of concern to the Government which is going to look at ways in which that expenditure can be reduced. The Opposition, the Australian public and especially, of course, the medical profession, believe that an 85 per cent cut in the reimbursement rate is totally unreasonable if the Government is going to maintain Medicare and not allow people to take out gap insurance. Such an arrangement will not be acceptable to the Australian community or the Opposition. The Government has to look at alternatives to the current Medicare arrangements. We will get a satisfactory health delivery system in this country only if a fundamental review of Medicare is undertaken. It is quite clear that the hospital system is on the verge of collapse. There is now more industrial strife in the hospital system and amongst the medical profession than there ever has been. Nurses are on strike and are resigning. Medical practitioners in New South Wales are threatening to once again withdraw their services. All of this has occurred as a result of Medicare; there is no other cause for the problems within the health profession at the moment. Those problems will continue and in fact will grow unless fundamental changes are made to Medicare. The people being disadvantaged by these problems are those seeking medical attention, especially welfare recipients, pensioners and others who cannot get into public hospital beds because of the queues that are being generated under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of time constraints, I will draw my speech to a conclusion. However, a number of very serious concerns have been raised by the report of a committee appointed by the Minister himself. Page 221 of the report points up the inconsistencies of the approach by the Government and the Minister to the medical benefits schedule. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The committee considers that the Government leaves itself open to accusations that its policy on Medicare benefit payments lacks consistency.</PARA>
<PARA>It certainly does lack consistency. The Minister has been totally inconsistent in the application of the medical benefits schedule and the extension of the schedule to a number of medical benefits items. However, I will not go into detail on that. I highlight the fact that the report criticises the Minister's carriage of his portfolio. It is a matter of real concern to the Opposition that this Government is not implementing a policy which ensures the provision of adequate health services to all Australians. We believe that there should be fundamental changes to Medicare.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will modify amendments of the water conservation and conveyance provisions of the income tax law proposed by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1985. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1985 was passed by this House last week and has been transmitted to another place. That Bill contains measures to put in place some of the proposals announced in the 19 September 1985 statement on reform of the Australian taxation system, one of which was to replace, with write-off over five years, the immediate income tax deductibility of capital expenditure incurred by primary producers on conserving or conveying water.</PARA>
<PARA> After further consideration, and as a result of consultations with the Australian Democrats, the Government has decided that such expenditure, where incurred under a contract entered into after 19 September 1985, should instead be deductible in three equal annual instalments, the first in the year in which the expenditure is incurred and a further instalment in each of the next two years. The revenue forgone as a consequence of this change is estimated at $5m in 1986-87 and $7m in 1987-88. I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>These amendments were moved on behalf of the Government in another place. Following further consideration of the tax reform package, including consultations with the Australian Democrats, the Government has agreed to make two changes to the sales tax measures contained in this Bill. Under those changes, solar panels for domestic hot water systems and school atlases are to continue to be exempt from sales tax. The most important of the other amendments will provide a sales tax exemption in respect of satellite earth stations designed to receive the homestead and community broadcasting satellite service that is to be transmitted by the Aussat satellite. This service will enable many Australians living in country areas to enjoy, for the first time, television and radio services long taken for granted by city dwellers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention in introducing this exemption is to make earth stations available at affordable prices to individuals and communities. The exemption will not however be available to persons acquiring earth stations for business use.</PARA>
<PARA> A possible unintended effect of the Bill will be corrected by an amendment that clarifies that raw nuts and seeds of a kind used as food ingredients will not be subject to sales tax as savoury snacks. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) foreshadowed this amendment in a Press release on 21 October 1985. Other amendments will make minor drafting changes to the Bill. Under the sales tax law manufacturers are generally not liable to pay tax on their aids to manufacture. This exemption will be extended under the amendments to retailers who manufacture taxable savoury snacks on their retail premises. The Bill as introduced would have had the unintended effect of exempting bicarbonate of soda marketed for non-culinary uses. A further amendment will ensure that bicarbonate of soda marketed for such uses, mainly as a swimming pool chemical, will continue to be subject to sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> A supplementary explanatory memorandum containing detailed explanations of technical aspects of the amendments, other than those relating to solar panels and school atlases, is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</PARA>

Backroom deals have been made hurriedly in this last week and now, on the very last afternoon of the Parliament, there is simply no time for the Opposition to consider these matters. I have only just this minute seen these provisions. We have had no chance to look at them properly. The whole thing is an absolute disgrace.

We believe that it is an absolute disgrace that they were brought in in this way without adequate notice and are being rammed through Parliament in a most unseemly way. These matters have been gone through in the Senate but, as I say, as a result of this backroom dealing with the Democrats, and as it is part of an overall deal, there are many aspects about which we have the greatest concern. We do not in this chamber oppose the provisions changing the sales tax laws. We understand, insofar as we have been able to examine these measures, that the ameliorations that are made may well be satisfactory, but at the same time we make the strongest protest at the way in which the whole matter has been handled by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) modifies amendments of the conservation and conveyance provisions of the income tax law proposed in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). The Bill was passed last week by the House and transmitted to the Senate. This particular provision was to replace with write-offs over five years the immediate income tax deductibility of capital expenditure incurred by primary producers in conserving or conveying water. The Opposition opposed the clause in the Bill giving effect to this provision because we believed that it was totally counter-productive to remove the complete write-off of water conservation or conveyance measures implemented by private enterprise, in effect on behalf of the nation. In a number of cases throughout the country works which would otherwise be required at public expense could be carried out by private enterprise with a suitable tax deduction. My colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) made this clear, as did other speakers. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in particular had an interest in this in relation to the River Murray, where the public costs of carrying out the necessary works are substantially increased without these taxation deductions being available to landowners. What the Government has done as part of its grubby little deal with the Australian Democrats is modify its proposals and replace its proposed five-year write-off with a three-year write-off. Of course, the Opposition is not going to object to that amelioration of circumstances but I would like to make it absolutely clear-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I point out that the total concessions given as a result of the tax deal done with the Australian Democrats, of which so much has been made by the Democrats and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), amounted to a miserable $7m out of the $800m additional income or revenue expected next year from the proposals. In the year beyond that, when $1.4 billion extra revenue is to be gained by the measures, the total concessions allowed will be less than $50m. One of the concessions that have been quantified is the concession on water conservation. The revenue forgone as a result of this change is estimated at $5m in 1986-87 and $7m in 1987-88. But the total concessions got by the Democrats in their much vaunted humbling, they thought, of the Government, amounted to less than $50m out of $1.4 billion.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period of operation of the amendments to the standard of proof which were passed by the Parliament in May this year. The Bill will extend the period of operation for a further six months from 6 December 1985. The need for the introduction of this legislation arises from the obstruction and intransigence of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate in relation to the Veterans' Entitlements Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government greatly regrets that it is being placed in the position where it is necessary to introduce this legislation. Without it, the previous standard of proof which applied to determining pension claims would again apply. This could have the effect of requiring that nearly all pensions claims must be accepted. This is a situation which the Government, the Opposition and the veteran community have regarded as unacceptable. I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Unfortunately, the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs has not been able to get back to the House at this hour and therefore I rise on his behalf. The Opposition does not accept the proposal of the Government. As we understand the position, the Government has accepted the amendments relating to the definition of allied veterans and the matter relating to acquired immune deficiency syndrome and therefore only one narrow part of the proposal is outstanding. In those circumstances the Opposition does not accept that it is proper for there to be a six-month extension to the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Act. We believe that it would be preferable for these matters to be resolved. The nature of the hiatus in veterans' entitlements is not one that can be happily condoned. Many people are uncertain in many areas relating to Government changes. Uncertainty is as bad as the consequences of adverse legislation and in this area we think it would be far preferable if the matter could be resolved. We therefore oppose the extension of six months and it is our intention that the matters be further discussed in the Senate between the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Gietzelt) and the shadow representatives.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 in accordance with heads of agreement negotiated recently by the Commonwealth with the Australian Gas Light Co.-AGL-in relation to haulage of gas on the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, construction of a northern lateral pipeline to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow and related matters. For some years the Commonwealth has been attempting to renegotiate the principal contract between the Pipeline Authority-TPA-and AGL-the 1974 haulage agreement-to overcome its lack of provision for recovery by the Pipeline Authority of unanticipated losses. These losses result from the Australian Gas Light Co.'s past and continuing inability to market gas at the levels it had nominated in the schedules to the agreement. At the end of 1984, the losses stood at $59m. Because of the structure of the agreement, this is an unserviced debt which by the end of the contract period, 31 December 2006, would exceed $1,000m and, depending on what assumptions are made about inflation, interest rates and volumes taken, could reach $2,000m in dollars of the day.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite extensive negotiations and exchanges between the Commonwealth, AGL and the New South Wales Government for over seven years, and especially since April 1983, no real progress was made until late last year. But a settlement has now been reached between the three parties under which AGL and the New South Wales Government can receive the benefits they seek, while the Commonwealth will achieve full recovery by 2006 of all past and future costs of construction and operation of the Moomba-Sydney trunk pipeline, the existing lateral pipelines to Wagga Wagga and Canberra, and the proposed lateral to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. A revised formula for haulage tariffs over the next 20 years will-without increasing the real costs to New South Wales consumers-enable the Commonwealth to recover all of its past and future costs, provide compressors required along the trunk pipeline and extend a lateral pipeline to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. After 2006, haulage tariffs will cover costs of service, which costs will include a profit component.</PARA>
<PARA> Extension of natural gas supplies to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow will be a most important outcome of the new arrangements. Construction of the $35m pipeline from Young to the three cities will employ a substantial work force, both directly and indirectly, and should result in a major industrial expansion in this important area of Australia. Natural gas supply will offer security to existing industries and opportunities for establishment of new undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the new agreement, AGL will assume control of existing gas undertakings in the three cities and embark on a $20m expansion and refurbishing program of supply facilities. Rights and conditions of employees of existing undertakings will be fully protected. The retail price of gas to households in each centre will be no more than 10 per cent above that in Sydney and will be uniform throughout the supply area. When these arrangements come into force on 1 January 1988, it is expected that future increases in the haulage tariff will never exceed increases in the consumer price index and will most probably be considerably lower.</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary that in future TPA and AGL work together co-operatively on the task of carrying gas to New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory consumers. Both parties need to use their best endeavours to ensure that gas is carried safely, economically and without supply failure, and that a viable natural gas market is maintained. To assist towards this objective, the Commonwealth has agreed to AGL's participation in the decision making of the Pipeline Authority by having a representative on the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to section 6 of the Act will permit this to be done. The appointment of an AGL nominee will permit closer co-operation and mutual support in the planning and operational activities of the two bodies, each of which has much to offer by way of experience and expertise, not only in pipeline operations but also in other aspects of the natural gas industry. TPA and AGL already have a close commercial relationship through what is virtually a sole supplier-sole purchaser situation. Like other part time members of the Authority, the AGL nominee will of course be bound by all of the provisions of the Act affecting such members including the conflict of interest provisions of section 9.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 15 removes the present requirement for the passage of specific legislation before construction of any new pipeline can be undertaken by the Authority. This amendment is sought for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Section 15 appears to require prior legislative approval for such essential elements of pipeline construction as route surveys, plan preparation and property and easement surveys, but also calls for inclusion in the enabling Bill of a detailed description of the pipeline route-which cannot be adequately prepared without some survey having been undertaken. The present provisions inhibit preparatory works of the kinds mentioned, and also such necessary preliminaries as stockpile site preparation and site office establishment.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) This difficulty will be enhanced when there is a heavy legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) All of the requirements of section 15 are applicable when any new pipeline, no matter how short, is proposed.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Separately from the provisions of this Act, there are adequate financial controls over the Authority through the need for ministerial approval for contracts involving expenditure exceeding $500,000-section 29-as well as Treasurer's approval for larger off-budget borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The Authority's accounts are subject to the Auditor-General's and Senate Estimates committee scrutiny, which, as honourable members know, can be acute.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Technical matters are properly the responsibility of the Authority which Parliament has established for that very purpose, and which possesses the necessary expertise. It is considered unnecessary and inappropriate for the Parliament to consider such matters as detailed descriptions of proposed pipeline routes and the limits of deviation, as is required by section 15 at present.</PARA>
<PARA>Passage of the amendment to section 15 will permit the Authority to initiate preliminary work on the lateral pipeline project, including the ordering of pipe, valves and associated equipment to ensure timely commencement of construction, and so meet the construction target date of late 1987 for supply of natural gas to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. Industrial and domestic consumers and local government authorities throughout the central west area-as well as the State Government-are all anxious to ensure that this target date is met.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislative provision for nomination of an AGL representative on the Pipeline Authority, and early commencement of the lateral pipeline to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow, are essential Commonwealth contributions towards a renegotiation of the 1974 haulage agreement from which the Commonwealth stands to gain substantial financial benefits. I commend the Bill to honourable members.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill represents the clear difference between the philosophies of this Labor Government and the coalition parties. On the one hand, the Government, through the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, seeks to implement the old Rex Connor line of the 1970s in having the Government control and own the farm. The Bill itself is a project of the Rex Connor era. It was following this Connor experience that the previous coalition Government amended the Pipeline Authority Act to require legislative approval of pipeline construction proposals. On the other hand, the Opposition believes that the Pipeline Authority would be better operated through private enterprise. We also believe that the Authority should be subject to full parliamentary review. The statutory requirement to report to Parliament should remain. The amending Bill removes pipeline construction proposals from prior legislative approval. The Authority's accounts scrutiny, by the Auditor-General and Senate Estimates committee, does not provide any safeguard against ministerial approval, and divorcement from that legislative approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This amendment to remove pipeline construction proposals from parliamentary authorisation would remove potentially significant financial outlays from prior parliamentary scrutiny and veto. The accumulated losses of $59m at the end of 1984, due to the Australian Gas Light Company's past and continuing inability to market gas at the levels it had nominated in the schedules, should be concern enough of the Authority's inability to perform. The fact that under the agreement, this loss by the year ended 31 December, 2006, would exceed $1,000m is frightening in itself and evidence of the failure of government enterprise to perform.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned by the Government's refusal to recognise the potential benefits from the privatisation of the Pipeline Authority. The Minister claims the revised pricing formula will allow the Commonwealth to recover past and future costs by the year 2006, and future price increases will never exceed increases in the consumer price index and will most probably be considerably lower. However, he qualifies this claim with the words, `it is expected'. On the performance of this Government, the Opposition has considerable doubt that the expectation will be realised. Consumers may rightly claim compensation if this commitment cannot be fulfilled. The end result may well be a considerable drain on government revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The success of the agreement depends on factors that are absolutely critical, such as the inflation rate, interest rates, costs, sales and currency valuation. The Australian Gas Light Co. is given a security of supply at a low price for 20-odd years in advance and, in fact, could have its expectation of greater profits realised under the agreement. It is disquieting to understand that the Minister, Senator Evans, is renewing the Whitlam years philosophy of Federal Government's ownership and control of resources. More recent decisions of the Government on cash bonus bidding, resource rental royalties, sanctions against uranium mining, further regulation, export controls and increased taxes, are all evidence of a Minister who wants to control all resource development, including gas pipelines and electricity generation.</PARA>
<PARA> Consumers or taxpayers, or both, invariably pay the cost of Government interference in an area where it has no responsibility. Such is the case in regard to TPA. Recovery of the past losses of $59m is evidence of higher tariffs to customers or a recovery from the tax purse in the future. The Opposition feels that this will be the inevitable result of the new arrangement. Future governments could well look into this arrangement, with opportunities to allow private ownership, restricted through the participation by the AGL representative. Unfortunately, it may limit the choice in private ownership to AGL alone.</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, the Opposition's decision to oppose this Bill was fully outlined in the Senate by Senator Durack and it is not intended to repeat all those reasons here. I am sure honourable members will be pleased to hear that. We have no confidence in the claims made by the Minister. Honourable members opposite will be equally pleased to hear that. Only the passage of time will confirm that lack of confidence. The Opposition opposes the amendments and the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House authorises the broadcasting and rebroadcasting on Australian radio and television stations of a sound record of excerpts of its proceedings during 1986, subject to the conditions determined for this purpose by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might not have heard as much of the broadcasting as have people outside this place. But those of us who have had the occasion to hear it, think it is a successful way of communicating with the public. By the broadcasting of direct excerpts of parliamentary proceedings people are able to hear outstanding speeches by members such as the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Townsville has never had such a great member as the member who now represents it. Some of his contributions this year have been nothing short of outstanding. It is a pleasure to visit his electorate in Townsville and to see what he has done. I was there recently for the opening of the massive new Commonwealth Centre. I must say that I am looking forward to going back there. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is most regrettable that the Leader of the House (Mr Young) has introduced sordid politics into this discussion this afternoon. He referred to one of the lesser lights from Queensland who is rarely heard in this place. There are other members of this Parliament-I find it hard to reflect on all of those-from the Liberal and National parties who have made an outstanding contribution. The Opposition does not oppose the passage of this motion. We think that the use of parliamentary debate by way of excerpts on the media has been beneficial. Most of us see some anomalies in the degree to which, in regard to the presentation of television images, we see and hear words used which supposedly relate to a film taken on another occasion. The film may have been taken when the member was talking about an entirely different event. But I think things are improving. The process of using excerpts has worked out well. I commend the practice that you, Mr Speaker, introduced of monitoring the degree to which there is some balance in the use of those excerpts. It is a practice which enables people at least to hear some extracts of proceedings of this place instead of listening only to the proceedings of the House of Commons in London. Frankly, that seemed to me to be an anomalous process. It is for that reason that I think this is a very worthwhile development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Mr Speaker, as I mentioned to you the other night, I trust that the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings will consider the matter to which you referred and allow the adjournment debate to be similarly broadcast, as are other parts of this Parliament's proceedings. When that happens it will be to the benefit of most of the electorate. Often those adjournment debates are very relevant to the concerns of individual Australians. I think it would be far better if an opportunity were provided for those excerpts to be similarly broadcast, as is the case in regard to other parts of the day's proceedings. Of course, they can be used as excerpts. But I think it would be better if they were broadcast in the normal way. The Opposition does not oppose this measure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to thank all those who have served this House during the year. Although I had the opportunity to thank many of them at a function in the courtyard last night there are perhaps a couple of special references which should be made here, and which I would like to make, at this point. I give special thanks to Alan Browning in his first session as Clerk of the House. He has, as we all expected and knew he would, performed his duties with great distinction. I thank Lyn Symons who has completed her first session as the first female Sergeant-at-Arms of this House. Again, to you, Lyn, go our congratulations and our thanks. Mr Speaker, I mention also Miss Phoebe Stoney, a Hansard reporter, who has just set a new Australian shorthand speed record. Our congratulations go to her. Finally, in mentioning particular people, our thanks go to our friend Mr Greg Rule, who is retiring after 21 years as an attendant to members of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also I would like to give special thanks to the Press Gallery, the members of which I believe have had a rich and fertile year; although not always an easy one. For example, I know they suffered considerable privation and, in some cases, severe sunburn to cover the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the Bahamas. However, with the fortitude we have come to associate with this intrepid band, they soldiered on through the rigours of the Bahamas. As some of those members of the Press Gallery go off to prepare their end of term reports on Ministers I would like to get in first and say that although their reporting has been up and down during the year they seem to have got on to the right track in the last few days.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, may I conclude by extending to you, to all honourable members and to all those who serve and who are associated with this House and to all their families our best wishes for Christmas and for what will certainly be a prosperous New Year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in extending thanks to those many people who make the Parliament work-Mr Speaker, to you, and to the Clerks and to the various attendants and officers of the House who are unfailingly polite and courteous, often under severely strained conditions. I take the opportunity, as the Prime Minister did, of wishing all of them and all members of the House a very relaxing Christmas holiday and an opportunity, as one does at Christmas time, to spend a little more time with one's family than the rigours of parliamentary life normally enable many of us to do. I hope that all members of the House have that opportunity and as a consequence their enthusiasm for the life is renewed over that holiday period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also would like to say something about the contribution of the Press Gallery. I think the Prime Minister is right when he says that members of the Press Gallery have had their ups and downs. They have not always got it right; they were wrong on one or two very celebrated occasions during the year. However, I will not be uncharitable about that. They do contribute to the working of the system and however much on occasions we might individually take issue with their respective judgments they do contribute. I am looking forward to the opportunity that a team drawn from members and affiliates of the Opposition-with some appropriate ring-in to match the Prime Minister's ring-in-will provide to join the Press Gallery in a game of cricket early in the New Year.</PARA>
<PARA> Very warmly and sincerely, Mr Speaker, to you and to all your colleagues and to my friends on both sides of the House, I hope all of you have a very happy and enjoyable Christmas and that it is a time-whatever one's views are on religious beliefs-of reflection, a time to spend with family and a time to renew associations with old friends.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). There are many who serve this place whose faces we see but whose names are not necessarily recorded. Because they have not all been mentioned, I mention a few of them in addition to extending, on behalf of myself and my Party, best wishes to all the members of this place. Alan Browning, Lyn Barlin and those who sit at this table have been mentioned. I pay particular tribute to Alan. It has been an interesting year for him. Assuming the mantle of Clerk of the House is a very senior responsibility within the Westminster system. I congratulate you, Alan, on the way in which you have exercised your functions. To you, Lyn, and to all the others of the team at the table, we are all indebted. Without you, I am afraid this place could really develop into mayhem-which view I do not doubt you, Mr Speaker, on occasions would more than endorse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are, however, outside this place a number of people to whom I want to refer. There is, of course, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, Mr J. M. Campbell. We have in both Mr Campbell and his staff quite outstanding talents. The Prime Minister mentioned Miss Phoebe Stoney. I do not know whether many people in Australia realise that she set an Australian shorthand record at a speed of an incredible 280 words per minute. It is a pace which few people, I think, would set in their normal speech. It is a record which I think is to be commended, and not just because she was able to achieve it. The fact that she was able to do so must make one apprehensive in case any of the words that are said by mistake in this place are thought not to have been recorded. Quite obviously, with standards of that speed there is little chance of any word being mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the head librarian and members of the staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. I think all of us have been indebted to Mr MacLean and those who work in the various sections of the Library. In opposition, I have found particularly notable the way in which those in the different sections of the Library can provide an enormously worthwhile input into areas where in government one is able to turn to departments. I know that I have found staff working in the defence section of tremendous value. They have an ability both to aggregate material and to pursue inquiries in a way which is beneficial to the working of the Parliament. Therefore, I commend Mr MacLean and each of those in the Library.</PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the Principal Attendant, Mr Neville Gathercole, and to all attendants. The Prime Minister referred to Mr Greg Rule, who is retiring after 21 years as a parliamentary attendant. To Greg we wish a long life and, for him and his family, good health as he goes about his task away from the occasional mayhem that is this place. To all the attendants, we thank you for the role you play. I extend my thanks also to the police who sit up in the gallery, who move around the Parliament, and who are an enormously important part of the security of the establishment.</PARA>
<PARA> I extend thanks to the Bills and Papers Office, to the Dining Room, to Carol and Jan and all those who play an important role there, to the Members Bar and to Bob and his other colleagues whom we all know so well. My thanks go to the drivers, to those outside this place who service our respective parties, to our respective secretariats and, of course to our staff, who render an enormous contribution to our cause and without whom we would be in a hopeless state.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been some observations made about members of the Press Gallery. I do not know whether all of us necessarily see the media in the same light at times. We do depend on them however, and much as this particular forum is seen by them as a fishbowl, I assure them that we, on occasions, look at them in not a dissimilar light. We look at their movements and their actions and interactions and wonder whether they are for real. Many in the community contribute to the well-being of the Parliament. I say thanks from all of us and wish them well for the Christmas season.</PARA>
<PARA> In thinking of one person to whom the Prime Minister made reference, Lyn Symons, I think it worth while to mention a story that was told to me; it might appeal to Mick in his Irish way. It is the story of two lunatics who came into this place and sat up in the gallery-</PARA>

They felt more and more at home, particularly in the rather raucous ways that prevail, Mr Speaker, on occasions during Question Time. They felt even more at home when Ms Symons led one of the members away after you decided you would give in to your ire, Mr Speaker, and to expel him from service of the House. Suddenly the bells began to ring and members began to mill around, as we are apt to in the course of divisions, and one lunatic turned to the other and said: `Ah, one of them has escaped'. I thought this might be an alternative: We are all about to escape, and in that vein we all look forward to a rather relaxed Christmas and New Year period. I wish all members of this place, and all those who have made this Parliament such a worthwhile venue in its way, all the best. For all that we are appalled at some aspects of the Government's management of the economy, there is nonetheless a bonhomie that exists that is worth while. We all know each other to a degree as individuals and in that respect I believe the Westminster system has much to commend it and that it is certainly something that deserves to endure.

As some people would know, Leader of the House is not the most popular of jobs from time to time during the year.

Those who were elected at the last election certainly brought some characters with them.</PARA>

Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity of extending to you, to all the members of the staff around Parliament House, to the people in Canberra who put up with us from one year's end to the other and to all those who give us great assistance in this place all the best for Christmas and the New Year.</PARA>

I thank the honourable members who have spoken for the good wishes they have conveyed. Of course, I reciprocate them. I will convey the good wishes of all members to the staff of all the parliamentary departments. I will do as I have done for the past two years at the end of the year and perambulate the departments and see all the employees and convey the good wishes to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to convey my thanks to the Clerks and their staff, particularly Alan Browning, who has taken over from Doug Blake and has settled in. We are fast getting a very good rapport. I also must mention that there has been the change with our first female Sergeant-at-Arms. I thought that the Leader of the National Party of Australia was going to tell a different story about one Opposition member who was suspended and who threatened to struggle when the Sergeant-at-Arms was going to remove him from the House. We have also had the first female attendants in the chamber this year. So, we believe that there is some affirmative action going on.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank Mrs Child, the Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker, and the temporary chairmen. I do not think the House realises how well served members are. People forget that this chair has to be occupied by someone to allow the proceedings to go on. I think you would all agree that that process has been smoothly carried out. I thank Mrs Child for having taken that under control.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank my personal staff-and I will not mention them by name-who serve the members well in the contact they have with them. They certainly give me a loyalty, devotion and service that I appreciate very much, as do those in my electorate office. Some honourable members might like to know that my senior private secretary, Mr Morrie Adamson, is retiring on 6 January. Morrie has been around this Parliament for a very long time. Some of the older members who have served on committees will well remember the contact they have had with him in the committee system. I first struck him on the Wildlife Conservation Committee. He has been a good friend and servant to honourable members and he has done a mighty job for this Parliament. I am sorry to lose him, and I wish him well in his retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of the media. So far, I have no complaint except for the occasional matters of privilege that I have to rule on, but they are outside my control. Some advances have been made. We have allowed filming which backs the news services, and the televising of the Budget speeches. We now allow excerpts of proceedings to be broadcast, and I believe that the media have shown a great degree of responsibility in using these tools that we have given them to give better exposure of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I guess that it is no secret that I am not particularly satisfied with behaviour in the House. I hope that the Standing Committee on Procedure will give us some assistance in the recommendations that it will bring forth and that there will be more guidance to honourable members, and even more guidance to the Speaker, who often has to decide whether in applying the sanction the very business of the day may not go on. That is one of the difficult decisions that I have to face.</PARA>
<PARA> I thank members of the House for the trust they have shown in me in the number of them who come into my office to ask for advice on parliamentary matters and respect the fact that I preserve their confidences. I also thank honourable members on both sides of the House for the friendship that they show to my wife and me. We appreciate that very much.

<PARA> I did state on 9 March 1985, in a press conference in Bangkok-and again in slightly different terms on 13 March following my return to Australia from a visit to several South East Asian countries-that the Heng Samrin administration is improving its administration and acceptability all the time. In my statement of 9 March, I also noted that the question of the improvememt in the administration and acceptability of the Heng Samrin administration was one of relativity, that is, it was `fairly dreadful by the standards we prefer but it's much superior to what it was'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to monitor closely conditions inside Cambodia. At present there is no major evidence available to us which would alter the general assessment contained in my statement of 9 March concerning the improvement in the administration and acceptability of the Heng Samrin administration. This assessment is based on evidence from a number of sources, including media reports and the accounts of people who go into Cambodia on behalf of non-governmental agencies and multilateral agencies, and others, including some members of a Joint Australian Parliamentary Delegation which visited Cambodia in 1984.</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Government has been unable to find sufficient evidence to support the proposition that Vietnam is pursuing a deliberate policy of migration to Cambodia or of changing the ethnic balance there. The Government accepts that some movement of ethnic Vietnamese into Cambodia has taken place in recent years. Many would appear to be Vietnamese who had been resident in Cambodia prior to the Pol Pot years. Cambodia had a Vietnamese minority which numbered about 500,000 before the exoduses of the 1970s.

<PARA> Ethiopia's worsening drought and food distribution problems have given added importance to an Australian presence in the country. This presence has allowed us to monitor events there closely since the mission opened in December 1984. Australia's increasing aid commitment in humanitarian and development areas in the Horn of Africa and in East Africa has required the upgrading of our representation in Addis Ababa. A Third Secretary (Development Assistance) has been appointed and will begin work in November this year.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Brunei- The Australian High Commission was established in Brunei in anticipation of its membership of Association of South East Asian Nations, and its independence, declared in January 1984. Our ASEAN neighbours are of great importance in determining Australia's foreign policy. As well, we accord high priority to regional Commonwealth countries, such as Brunei. These were the primary reasons for the establishment of an Australian mission in Brunei.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Budapest-Hungary is a significant country in East Europe. For many years, we have had a fruitful exchange on issues such as disarmament, East-West relations, non-proliferation and Comecon.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, Hungary is a model of national self management in the Warsaw Pact. Its attempts at economic and social reform, which have brought about greater emphasis on the importance of market forces, deserve greater diplomatic support.</PARA>
<PARA> The potential for boosting and diversifying Australian trade with Hungary had existed for a long time. Prior to the establishment of our Embassy in Budapest, Hungary's foreign trade exceeded one-third of its gross domestic product, and more than half of that was trade with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.</PARA>
<PARA> The early 1980's saw a closer relationship developing between Australia and Hungary. This created a heavy administrative burden on our diplomatic mission in Vienna, which was then accredited to Hungary. In the three years to February 1984, the Australian Ambassador made some twenty five trips to Hungary. As well, we were receiving constant complaints from Hungarian officials in Australia about the lengthy delays in issuing Australian visas to Hungarians on official business. Both these examples indicate a workload which required the establishment of a resident Australian mission in Hungary.</PARA>
<PARA> The Hungarian Government had maintained an Embassy in Canberra for many years prior to 1984. This factor and the large Hungarian community in Australia provided further impetus for the establishment of an Australian mission in Hungary.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Geneva Disarmament-Strictly speaking, the appointment of an Ambassador for Disarmament in May 1983 did not require establishment of a new mission. It simply led to an increase of two in the staffing level at the Australian Embassy in Geneva, with the post providing common services. Australia's increasingly active participation in disarmament and arms control efforts reflects the Government's strong commitment to balanced and verifiable arms control and disarmament measures both nuclear and conventional.</PARA>
<PARA> Our Government's contribution to disarmament has been enhanced significantly by the appointment of an Ambassador for Disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Kathmandu-There were two main reasons for the establishment of a resident Australian diplomatic mission in Nepal. Firstly, there was a need to improve the efficiency of consular services for the very large number of Australians visiting Nepal which, prior to the opening of the embassy in Kathmandu, the British were conducting on our behalf. The volume of work put British consular services in Nepal under strain and there were frequent requests by the British that we rectify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> A second reason for the establishment of a resident Australian mission in Nepal was that it would facilitate the administration of the Australian aid program to Nepal.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Port Louis-The reasons which led us to establish an Australian mission in Port Louis are strategic, political and economic. The Australian Government recognises the strategic importance of peace and stability in the Indian Ocean, and it recognises the need for Australia to strengthen its relations and promote its views amongst the Indian Ocean Island States. The newly established mission in Port Louis is therefore dually accredited in the Comores and the Seychelles. Accreditation in Madagascar has been sought. The mission provides a central focus for the conduct of the broad range of Australian interests in the Indian Ocean.</PARA>
<PARA> Of all the Indian Ocean states, it is Mauritius that has established a close economic relationship with Australia. In 1983-4 Australian exports to Mauritius equalled total Australian exports to black African nations. As well, the Government of Mauritius established a diplomatic mission in Australia in 1977, and was becoming increasingly concerned that we had not reciprocated and established a resident mission in Port Louis. Prior to its establishment, the High Commissioner in Dar Es Salaam was accredited to Mauritius pending agreement from the Madagascar Government for the transfer of accreditation to Port Louis. Our High Commission in Tanzania remains responsible for Australia's relations with Madagascar.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, a large Mauritian community in Australia made the establishment of an Australian diplomatic presence in Port Louis even more important.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Riyadh-The Australian Embassy in Riyadh was relocated from Jeddah due to Saudi Government policy which required all missions in the country to relocate in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh.</PARA>
<PARA> Saudi Arabia is of great importance to Australia, by virtue of its geographical location between two important sea routes, and as an important source of oil for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the establishment of the Australian Embassy in Jeddah, Australia has become recognised by Saudi Arabia as a reliable trading partner and is increasingly looked upon as a source of advice and training in a number of fields of economic and social development. The Embassy is primarily concerned with maintaining a healthy bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and the Yemens, to which our Ambassador in Saudi Arabia is accredited. This means advancing our politicial and economic interests, particularly in relation to our access to future oil supplies and trade.</PARA>
<PARA> With the transfer of our Embassy to Riyadh, the post in Jeddah became a Consulate-General, staffed solely by Department of Trade personnel.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) Shanghai-In 1978 the Australian Government indicated its intention to open a Consulate-General in Shanghai in an Exchange of Notes. Since that time, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and Britian, and various non-Western nations have recognised the importance of establishing Consulates-General in Shanghai. The need to expand our representation was seen as essential for effectively representing our interests in China. The establishment of a Consulate-General in Shanghai was an ideal location for both political and economic reasons. Trade opportunities between Australia and China should be maximised through the establishment of a mission in the industrial heartland. As well, Shanghai has an important political role in China. During this century political movements in Shanghai have been a major determinant of the direction of Chinese politics.</PARA>

<PARA> Footnote: The 1983-4 figures do not include officers on Secondment elsewhere (32) and those on maternity leave, extended sick leave or long service leave (42). In 1984-5 a new system of collecting data on staff numbers, Human Resource Budgeting, was introduced for all Commonwealth Departments. The 1984-5 figures do not include inoperatives, nor part time staff (71). Experts (120 in 1985) and Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (23 in 1985) staff, employed by Australian Development Assistance Bureau are not included.</PARA>
<PARA>(2). Overall, the total increase of staff employed by my Department over the period 1979 to 1985 is 1.3 per cent (59). This figure is distorted somewhat by the drastic drop in ADAB's staffing figures, especially during the 1979-1983/84 period. With ADAB figures removed, the increase still comes to the modest figure of 2.6 per cent (109).</PARA>
<PARA>The increases in Foreign Affairs staff levels can be largely attributed to three factors: changing Government priorities in the formulation of foreign policy, new policy initiatives on the domestic front and large increases in workload for particular important functions of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Changing government priorities in formulating foreign policy has led to the establishment of 15 new missions overseas, and closure of 7 in the period 1979 to 1985. This results in a net increase of 9 in Australia's overseas missions.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the fifteen newly established missions, twelve required Executive Council appointments for the head of mission position. Three, (Bali, Shanghai and Houston) were Consulates-General requiring appointment of the head of mission at official level, by the Secretary of the Department. This led to a direct increase in Executive Council appointments of eight.</PARA>
<PARA>One further appointment at Executive Council level was required when our consulate at Nicosia, Cyprus was upgraded to a diplomatic mission in January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>This increase of 11% in the Executive Council appointments reflects a reasonably constant level of increase across all streams of the Department. The FAO stream recorded an increase of 15 per cent (64) with the Consular and Administrative stream, and the Keyboards and Technical stream increasing by 11.9 per cent (108) and 14.9 per cent (81) respectively. The increase in Australia-based staff is to be expected when there is such an increase in the number of missions. The impact of these increases has been largely offset by a decrease of 7 per cent (153) in locally engaged staff in the period.</PARA>
<PARA>The location of these new missions is a reflection of the changing priorities of Australian foreign policy in the 1980's. Of the fifteen new posts opened, six are in the Pacific and Asian regions, four are in Africa. Only one post, Geneva Disarmament, has been established in West Europe. This special mission concentrates on pursuing Australia's arms control and disarmament policies particularly, but not exclusively in the multilateral field. It is indicative of a new high priority in Australia's foreign policy set by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The changed priorities of the Government has led to the creation of two new branches and four new sections in the Department. A Disarmament and Arms Control Branch and a Treaties Branch was established in 1983. As well, an International Year of Peace (IYP) Secretariat and three new Sections dealing with chemical weapons, nuclear non-proliferation and human rights, have been established.</PARA>
<PARA>The Governments' domestic policy initiatives, EEO, industrial democracy, and FOI have all contributed to an increasing workload for the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>The third factor which has led to some staff increases is the increased activity for certain Departmental functions. This is especially so of the communications network, which experienced a 23 per cent increase in the 1983-4 period alone, and the passports function.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most important, and public functions of the Department is the issue of Australian passports. As a result of the Stewart Royal Commission, forty extra positions were created, by Mr Street, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs in December 1982 to upgrade security arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1982, passport applications have increased by 24 per cent. Without a further increase in staff of 24 positions (12.5 per cent) the Department's passports processing time and workload would have been intolerable.</PARA>
<PARA>Levels of staff employed by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau have declined since 1979 by 10.9 per cent. As the figures revealed, the decline is the result of the previous Government's policy which gave extremely low priority to aid administration. In the period 1979 to 1983-4 the number of ADAB staff declined by 17.9 per cent. The present government has attempted to redress this decline, with an increase of 7.8 per cent in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA>In the future, as the Jackson Committee recommendations for upgrading ADAB functions and administration are implemented, ADAB will be better equipped to administer our aid program.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several authoritative Western public sources give figures for the number of submarines in the Soviet Pacific Fleet which agree closely with those quoted in the question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Jane's Fighting Ships 1984-1985 lists 24 SSBN, 7 SSB and 96 other submarines;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Soviet Military Power 1985 lists 31 SSBN/SSB and 103 other submarines;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Military Balance 1984-1985 lists 25 SSBN, 6 SSB and 102 other submarines.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no reason to question the broad accuracy of these assessments: see, for example, the answer to question on notice No. 803.</PARA>
<PARA> The terms SSBN and SSB refer to nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines and conventionally powered ballistic missile submarines respectively. The term `strategic', in this context, has traditionally been taken as referring to submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles and accountable under the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I Interim Agreement. This category of submarines comprises all modern ballistic missile submarines operational or under construction on the date of signature of the SALT I Interim Agreement (26 May 1972) and any older submarines converted to carry new missiles after the date of signature of the Interim Agreement. For the Soviet Union (and for the United States) only SSBNs are `strategic' submarines in the sense of being SALT-accountable: 13 older Soviet submarines carrying a total of 39 shorter-range ballistic missiles and including the SSBS assigned to the Pacific Fleet are considered to be assigned to theatre roles (Soviet Military Power, page 31). I might add that the ability to fire nuclear weapons is not limited to ballistic missile submarines alone. Other classes of submarines are also nuclear-capable: see e.g. pp 95-97 of Soviet Military Power 1985.</PARA>

Other information made public about the agreement is that licence fee for one year's fishing by Soviet vessels is some $A2.4m; that the agreement allows Soviet vessels to fish in Kiribati's exclusive economic zone for 12 months; and that Kiribati has not granted the Soviet Union access to shore based facilities on Kiribati.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Government understands that the operational anti-ballistic missile complex centred on Moscow employs interceptor missiles with nuclear warheads.

<PARA> (3) The Government is deeply concerned about the probable consequences of the pursuit of strategic defences for strategic stability and the prospects for reductions in the nuclear arsenals. It is more concerned to see the full integrity of the ABM Treaty preserved than to support its demise through non-nuclear rather than nuclear means. The Government has stated that it endorses neither the SDI nor what it accepts to be-despite Soviet denials-a comparable Soviet program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Yes. (b) The United States economic embargo against Nicaragua was a unilateral action which did not receive significant international support and was not joined by any other country. As also pointed out in my statement of 2 May, the embargo was also unhelpful to the Contadora process. It was the Government's assessment that in these circumstances, the embargo was a severe step which would not succeed in bringing about changes in the attitude of the Nicaraguan Government desired by the United States. The Government's belief that the action was likely to increase the resolve of the Nicaraguan Government to resist United States pressure has in fact proved to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The situation in South Africa and the international community's response to it is not analogous to that of Nicaragua. The Government takes the view that concerted international economic and other measures are important and effective means of exerting pressure on South Africa to encourage peaceful change. This approach is in keeping with the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Nassau where the Government committed itself to encourage an effective process of change and reform in South Africa. The main elements of the Government's approach is the implementation of a range of measures to be introduced in a graduated way and the establishment of mechanisms for dialogue through a group of eminent persons.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not seek to impose sanctions measures for their own sake. We seek rather to play a constructive role in developing proposals to assist the peaceful transition of South Africa to a non-racial society based on universal adult suffrage.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The figures available on the number of anti-Government Nicaraguan Contras in Nicaragua, and in neighbouring countries, vary according to source. The Contras themselves have claimed that they have more than 16,000 men under arms. The Nicaraguan Government, on the other hand, puts their numbers at about 12,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The vast majority of Contra troops are believed to be peasants, but there are also numbers of Miskito Indians and members of other indigenous groups, and officers and men of the National Guard of former dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. There have been reports that young men fleeing the draft in Nicaragua and deserters from the Sandinist Popular Army have joined the Contras. Other reports allege forcible recruitment of peasants and draft evaders by Contras both in Nicaragua and among displaced Nicaraguans in neighbouring countries. Most of the Contra senior command are former members of the National Guard of Somoza.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) `Democratic Resistance' is a term used by the United States Government to describe the external opposition and in particular the armed insurgent groups who are collectively known as Contras. The political arm of the major Contra groups is the recently formed Unified Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO). UNO's political program includes calls for:</PARA>
<PARA> national reconciliation based on amnesty and total pardon for political and related crimes applicable to all Nicaraguans without exception;</PARA>
<PARA> development of a democratic political and judicial system.</PARA>
<PARA> Arturo Cruz, Alfonso Robelo and Adolfo Calero are members of the 12-man Council of UNO. All three are businessmen who participated to varying degrees in opposition to the regime of Anastasio Somza.</PARA>
<PARA> Before breaking with the Sandinistas in 1981, Arturo Cruz served as Director of Nicaragua's Central Bank, a member of the Governing Junta for National Reconstruction, and then as Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United States. Cruz was a presidential candidate for the Nicaraguan opposition grouping, the Coordinadora Democratica, before the group withdrew from the November 1984 elections.</PARA>
<PARA> Alfonso Robelo founded the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (MDN) in 1978. The MDN later joined the Broad Opposition Front (FAO), which unsuccessfully sought to negotiate a settlement with the Somoza regime in 1978-79. Robelo served briefly on the governing Junta which initially replaced Somoza. He was leader of the political wing of the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance (ARDE), a Contra group operating from Cost Rica which split in 1984. Robelo's faction then joined the main Contra group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN).</PARA>
<PARA> Adolfo Calero is political head of the FDN. He was leader of the Conservative Democratic Party in Nicaragua and later became a member of the FAO. Calero left Nicaragua in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The three persons mentioned all espouse democratic principles but their influence (particularly that of Cruz and Robelo) over the military arm of the UNO, which is essentially the FDN, is believed to be minimal. The military commanders of the FDN are mainly former Somoza National Guardsmen, who could not be regarded as `committed democrats'. It is a common assessment that the formation of UNO and the presence within it of persons such as Cruz and Robelo is intended to provide some international respectability to the Contras.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government has expressed concern at the erosion of pluralism and civil liberties in Nicaragua on a number of occasions and will continue to do so where appropriate. Most recently, I said in a speech delivered to the Australian Human Rights Congress on Central America on 21 July 1985, that the human rights record of the Sandinistas' since the revolution has not been immaculate and that it would be a tragedy, after what the Nicaraguans have been through, if they trampled human rights in the rush to the barricades. At the same time, the Government has made clear that it believes the human rights record of the Nicaraguan Government to be considerably better than those of some other Central American Governments. The human rights record of the Contras is atrocious.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1 (a) and (b) various reports on Eastern bloc military assistance to Nicaragua are available to the Government, including the United States State Department/Defense Department booklet on which these questions are based. While trends are clear, it is often difficult to be certain about details. Some earlier reports which made categorical claims about Soviet assistance were later shown to be in error. Eastern bloc assistance has been applied to a variety of purposes, the total value of which would be in excess of $US70m. The assistance includes provision of military equipment and training, civil aid and provision of civilian technical advisers.</PARA>
<PARA> Nicaragua also receives aid from Western countries (though no longer from the United States). However, its parlous econonic situation and the ongoing conflict with the Contras has resulted in increasing reliance on the Eastern bloc. As the Nicaraguan Government considers that its national sovereignty is under threat, it is to be expected that much of the aid is channelled into military areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Nicaragua's infrastructural needs are great. Facilities constructed with Eastern bloc assistance could presumably be used for military purposes if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> 2 (a) There are other runways of this length at Goloson International Airport, Honduras, El Salvador International Airport, General Torrijos Herrera Airport, Panama, and Santa Elena Peten Airport in Guatemala, which could be used for military purposes if required. (b) It is the Government's understanding that Punta Huete will be a military airfied. The Government has not seen a text of the reported admission by the Nicaraguan Air Force Commander to this effect. (c) Yes. (d) There is considerable debate over what constitutes the `regional military balance'. This issue is one of the sticking points in the present Contadora negotiations. The Nicaraguan army is larger and better equipped than those of any of its Central American neighbours. However, the Nicaraguan air force inventory of fixed-wing aircraft is obsolete and inferior to that of each of Honduras and El Salvador. In addition, Nicaraguan public statements express fears of US invasion. Nicaragua's armed forces expansion is undoubtedly based partly on these fears. The Nicaraguan concept of `balance' then is quite different to that of other Central American countries, which are unwilling to accept a situation of Nicaraguan superiority over them, individually or collectively.</PARA>
<PARA> There could also be debate over the term `jet aircraft', which might refer to anything from a trainer to a sophisticated high performance fighter. Any judgement about the significance of acquiring jet aircraft would obviously depend on the type and quantity of aircraft involved. The United States has indicated that it would regard the acquisition of `sophisticated fighter aircraft' as a provocative development.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has consistently taken the view that military action will not solve the problems of Central America. Irrespective of the various concepts of `balance', a Central American arms race would be a wasteful diversion of resources, likely only to exacerbate tensions and to hinder the search for a peaceful, negotiated settlement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) In early 1985, an economic adviser to the Nicaraguan Government estimated that Government's participation in various sectors of the economy as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Agriculture...25 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Mining...100 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Construction and Energy...Majority participation</PARA>
<PARA> (Other) industry...30 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Expropriation has been selective. Confiscation of the property of the family of the deposed dictator, Anastasio Somoza, itself had a marked impact on the public/private sector profile. Most estimates suggest that properties and businesses owned by the Somoza family and close associates accounted for approximately 40% of the country's economic resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Media censorship has been in force in Nicaragua continuously since March 1982, when a State of Emergency was declared in response to an intensification of anti-Government Contra activity. All media outlets are subject to prior censorship, including the independent daily newspaper La Prensa. Press items on military matters are specifically prohibited, and in the case of La Prensa, articles critical of the Government have often, but not always, been censored.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Sandinista Defence Committees originated as neighbourhood self-defence groups during the campaign to overthrow the Somoza regime. They function as municipal authorities and their responsibilities include the distribution of ration cards, organising neighbourhood groups to attend rallies, issuing of letters of recommendation for the issue of licences, loans, business permits, etc., involvement in mass vaccination campaigns, and patrolling of neighbourhoods at night. These functions entail a degree of social control and there exists the potential for abuse of such powers by individuals and by the Nicaraguan Government. At a recent National Congress of Sandinista Defence Committees, participants acknowledged that many abuses had occurred and adopted measures aimed at eliminating them.</PARA>

<PARA> `The Government accepts the recommendation. Australia will participate in international activities on supplier guidelines as a proponent of stricter controls and procedures, particularly in relation to supply to non-NPT countries.

<PARA> Australia's supply policies require non-nuclear weapon state customers to be members of the NPT and to have IAEA safeguards applied to all their nuclear facilities at all times.</PARA>

Australia does not consider this approach satisfactory. Permitting non-nuclear weapon States which have not made binding non-proliferation commitments to acquire nuclear items on less stringent conditions than countries which have made such commitments lessens the incentive to join the NPT.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. To elaborate, President Reagan said on 10 June 1985 that the United States would continue to not undercut the expired Strategic Arms Limitations Talks I agreement or the unratified SALT II agreement as long as the Soviet Union exercised equal restraint. He also said that where Soviet violations are irreversible the United States reserved the right to respond in a proportionate manner at the appropriate time. With regard to the ABM Treaty, Secretary of State Shultz said in a speech on 24 October 1985 that `our research program is and will continue to be consistent with the ABM Treaty' and `our SDI research program has been structured and, as the President reaffirmed last Friday, will continue to be conducted in accordance with a restrictive interpretation of the Treaty's obligations'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Since the expiry of the SALT I interim agreement on offensive weapons in 1977 and since 1981 when the Reagan Administration made clear its intention not to ratify the SALT II agreement the Soviet Union has joined the United States in a series of political commitments to refrain from actions that would undercut these agreements. In an authorative booklet, Star Wars: Dangers and Delusions (1985) it was stated that `the USSR abides rigidly by the provisions of the permanent ABM Treaty signed in 1972'. In bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union on arms control and disarmament issues the Government has urged full compliance with the provisions of existing treaties.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The Soviet Union has not made such information publicly available, but United States Government publications and statements indicate that the Soviet Union has deployed a total of 818 `fourth generation' (a US term) ICBMs since the signing of the SALT I Interim Agreement in 1972, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> SS17 (US designation) 150</PARA>
<PARA> SS18 (US designation) 308</PARA>
<PARA> SS19 (US designation) 360</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Soviet Union has also retired a large number of older ICBMs since the signing of the SALT I Interim Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The United States believes the Soviet Union has flight tested two new ICBMs, which it designated the SS-X-24 and the SS-X-25 (now redesignated the SS25). The Soviet Union denies that the SS25 is a new ICBM and has said that it is a modernisation of an existing ICBM, the SS13.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It is assumed that the question relates to deployment of ballistic missiles over the period since the signing of the SALT I Interim Agreement in May 1972, when the United States estimated that the Soviet Union had a total of 1618 ICBM and 740 SLBM launchers either operational or under construction. The Statement of Data on the Numbers of Strategic Offensive Arms as of the Date of Signature of the Treaty made by the Soviet Union when signing the Salt II Treaty on 18 June 1979 indicates that the Soviet Union possessed 1398 ICBM launchers at that time, a reduction of 230 on the number of ICBM launchers either under construction or operational at the signing of Salt I, and 950 launchers of SLBMs (as permitted under the SALT I Interim Agreement), an increase of 210. The figure for ICBM launchers remains the same today. The number of SLBM launchers fluctuates from time to time as new systems are introduced and older ones retired, but remains in the vicinity of the 950 limit specified in the SALT I Interim Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of `fourth generation' Soviet ICBMs deployed since the signing of SALT I is given in (a) above. In addition the Government has noted recent Statements by the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Weinberger, that the Soviet Union recently commenced deployment of the first of its `fifth generation' ICBMs, the SS25.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Soviet Union does not make such information available, it is not possible to be precise as to the number of new Soviet ballistic missile warheads deployed since 1972. Most authoritative Western public sources estimate that the numbers of Soviet ICBM warheads rose from around 1500 in 1972 to around 6300 today and that Soviet SLBM warheads increased over the same period from around 450 to around 2150 today.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) In 1972 the United States had 1054 ICBMs and 656 SLBMs, compared with around 1025 ICBMs and 648 SLBMs today. In the same period United States ICBM warheads rose from around 1500 to around 2125, and SLBM warheads from around 2400 to around 5750.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Public sources of such information differ on this point. For example the SIPRI Yearbooks for 1980 and 1984 indicate this to be the case: but graphs which appear on pages 30 and 33 of the United States Defense Department publication `Soviet Military Power 1985' appear to give a contrary indication.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Calculations of the quantity known as `hard target kill potential' depend on a number of factors and assumptions relating to the number of attacking warheads and their estimated accuracy and explosive power. The trend since 1979 towards deployment by the Soviet Union of more accurate missiles with multiple warheads has significantly increased Soviet hard target kill potential: but in view of the uncertainties associated with information in the public record on the increase in the number of Soviet ballistic missile warheads since 1979 (see (e) above), it is not possible to state with certainty by how much.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. In his Parliamentary Statement of 10 May 1984 about the publication in the National Times of purported extracts from a Defence Department Document entitled: `The Strategic Basis of Australian Defence Policy 1983', Senator Gareth Evans made clear that such documents represent the outcome of periodic reviews designed to advise Government on how threats to Australia may arise and on the implications for our security. As the name implies the documents offer advice on the basis for defence policy and do not purport to provide a specific plan for future defence actions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty contributes to regional security through its objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In particular, the provisions of the Treaty prohibiting the acquisition of nuclear explosive devices and their stationing or testing on the territory of Parties are in the security interests of the region and help to preserve the South West Pacific as a region free of superpower rivalry. These objectives are further reinforced by the draft Protocols to the Treaty which invite France, the United Kingdom and the United States to apply key provisions of the Treaty to their territories within the Zone and which invite the five nuclear weapon States to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Parties to the Treaty and not to test nuclear explosive devices anywhere within the Zone. At the same time the Treaty and its draft Protocols in no way cut across Australia's obligations under the ANZUS Treaty and the broader defence relationship between Australia and the United States which, in the Government's view, continues to be fundamental to Australian security and to contribute to the stability of the region as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) As to the general thesis of the question, the Government is of the view there is broad parity between the military power of the superpowers, although it acknowledges that significant asymmetries exist at particular levels in the forces of both sides: and ICBMs, though important, are not the sole indices of strategic nuclear power.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also of the view that the need to maintain broad parity between the superpowers is of fundamental importance to all countries, including Australia. It would greatly prefer that this were done by a mutual and verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons testing production and development followed by negotiations which aim for deep cuts in the high stockpiles of nuclear weapons through equitable and verifiable arms control agreements. The immediate goal must be the most stable possible balance at the lowest possible level of nuclear weapons: the ultimate goal must remain their complete elimination. For this reason it has not endorsed the strategic modernisation programs of either superpower.</PARA>

<PARA> The question of whether the definition of stationing contained in Article 1(d) of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty should include a time element to cover, for example, the duration or pattern of port visits was considered by the South Pacific Forum's Working Group which drafted the Treaty. It was noted that the principles on a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone adopted by Forum Heads of Government at their meeting in Tuvalu in August 1984 had explicitly stated that the sovereign right of a country to decide on port access was unqualified. Moreover, the utility of such a time frame was questioned since circumstances of port visits varied considerably. It was also noted that should any Party to the Treaty have doubts or questions concerning the duration or pattern of port visits it would be open to it to invoke the consultation provisions of the Treaty (Article 10) in order to seek clarification.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Government has allocated in the 1985-86 official development assistance budget $140.283m in support of education and training programs, most of which will be conducted in Australia. A major component is the contribution by the Commonwealth towards the education in Australia of sponsored and private students from developing countries at the post-secondary level. This is estimated at $97.398m for 1985-86:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The estimated educational contribution for sponsored students is $8.984m. The Government also meets the overseas student charge, fares and living expenses for all sponsored students.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The estimated support for the education of private overseas students is $88.414m. For private students from Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries the Australian Government also meets the overseas student charge.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Official development assistance (ODA) in 1985-86 is estimated at 0.45 per cent of the Gross National Product (GNP). If the cost of the educational support for private overseas students (estimated at $88.414m in 1985-86) is excluded from the calculation, the ODA/GNP ratio is estimated at 0.41 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA> I have nothing further to add to the answer provided by Senator Gareth Evans to a question without notice in the Senate on 16 September. In his answer, Senator Evans said that the Government is not giving any formal consideration at this stage to the concept of a Government hydro-carbon corporation to operate in the Timor Gap. Such a corporation is one possible method of organising development on the Australian side in a possible joint development zone with Indonesia. There are many different ways in which the Australian interests could be represented and mobilised in the context of that proposed joint development zone. The hydro-carbon corporation or the notion of some governmental agency as the administering authority, no doubt in conjunction with private enterprise, is just one of a number of possible options and certainly should not generate any concern on the part of the oil industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The bulk of evidence produced in support of allegations that Soviet troops in Afghanistan have used lethal chemical and toxin weapons consists of refugee and defector reports, and chemical analysis by scientists in the United States of fragments of two Soviet gas masks acquired in Afghanistan in 1981: see for example the relevant sections of the United States' State Department Special Reports No. 98 `Chemical Warfare in South East Asia and Afghanistan' of March 1982 and No. 104 `Chemical Warfare in South East Asia and Afghanistan-An Update', of November 1982. Further details regarding the analysis of the gas masks were made public at an on-the-record State Department media briefing on 29 November 1982. Examples of refugee reports of alleged use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan may also be found in the Report of the Group of Experts to investigate Reports of the Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons sent to the United Nations Secretary General on 26 November 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Government has taken careful note of the allegations by the United States that the Soviet Union has used lethal chemical and toxin agents in Afghanistan, and of Soviet statements dismissing these allegations. It has also noted the inconclusive nature of much of the evidence (see e.g. the United Nations report cited above). Nevertheless the Government views these reports and allegations with considerable concern. There appears to be a case to answer and the Government hopes the Soviet Union will take appropriate steps to demonstrate its compliance with the relevant arms control agreements: in this case the 1925 Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating Poisonous or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> This particular issue has not been raised with the Soviet Union. The Government has, however, stressed on a number of occasions to the Soviet Union the importance it places on full adherence by all parties to the terms of arms control treaties. It has also emphasised the importance it places on the urgent need for a comprehensive chemical weapons Convention which would outlaw the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The Soviet Union has also been made aware of Australian concerns over the number of reports of use of chemical weapons over the past few years and of Australia's firm view that all such reports should be promptly and thoroughly investigated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. On the basis of information available to the Government, I stated in public on 8 July 1984 that between 2,000 and 4,000 people had been shot without trial by so-called `death squads' in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There have been reports from time to time of `mysterious killings' in Jakata and other centres. In the absence of reliable information about the extent of the killings, it is difficult to determine their present level. At the same time, the number of victims of such killings appears to have substantially declined over the past eighteen months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am not aware of any firm evidence to show that there is a connection between these reported mysterious killings and the Indonesian authorities. If the Indonesian authorities have sanctioned the executions, as alleged in press reports, it would be a matter of deep concern to the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I raised this matter with relevant Indonesian authorities during my visit to Jakarta for the Association of South East Asian Nations Plus Ministerial Consultations in July 1984. The position of the Indonesian Government has been that the killings are the result of fighting between rival criminal gangs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government believes that summary executions are a clear contravention of the fundamental human rights embodied in the universal declaration on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights. The Government has consistently taken the view that Australia has a strong interest in seeing internationally accepted human rights observed and respected, especially in our region, and believes that in all situations the due process of law should be followed. Our representations to the Indonesian authorities are in keeping with this interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United States has charged that the Soviet Union has violated the relevant provision of the SALT II Treaty (Article IV.9) which prohibits each side from flight testing and deploying more than one new type of light ICBM.</PARA>
<PARA> According to United States sources the Soviet Union advised the United States that a new multiple-warhead ICBM it began flight-testing in late 1982, designated the SS-X-24 by the United States, was its one new type of light ICBM permitted under the Treaty. Subsequently the Soviet Union began testing another ICBM, designated the SS-X-25 by the United States. In response to United States queries the Soviet Union claimed that this ICBM was only a modification of an existing ICBM, the SS13, first deployed in 1969. The United States does not accept this assertion. It believes the ICBM in question to be a second new type of ICBM and thus prohibited under SALT II.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of whether the SS25 is a new ICBM as defined by the SALT II Treaty involves complex technical and legal issues. The Government believes that the complex of issues surrounding the SS25 raises legitimate questions concerning Soviet compliance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty. There appears to be a case to answer and it hopes the Soviet Union will take appropriate steps to respond to United States concerns and demonstrate clearly its compliance with the relevant provisions of SALT II.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government regards the existing agreements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as important to all countries because the interests of all are engaged. It attaches great importance to full compliance by both parties with all their agreements, and has made this point to both of them.</PARA>

In explaining the issues discussed and agreed with our Treaty partners at the ANZUS Council meeting in Washington in July 1983, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> `. . . we cannot assume military support from our Treaty partners in every contingency; we should therefore develop a self-defence capability in case in a particular contingency we need to rely on our own resources. By definition, therefore, it would not be prudent to base the development of our Defence Force structure on the assumption that our forces will necessarily be part of a superpower deployment in the event of any form of hostilities in which we are involved. It is more prudent and proper to elaborate these force structures on the basis of a self-defence capability within our regional context.</PARA>
<PARA> I hasten to add for clarity of record that our threat assessment is as it was for the previous Government, that is, that in the foreseeable future we are not confronted by any likely regional threat.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, agreement was explicitly reached as to Australia's prime defence role, namely, as one of building our self-defence capability within our regional context, rather than as a presumed global role as some sort of appendix of a superpower.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In May 1984, the report of the Australian Science and Technology Council's inquiry into Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle was tabled in Parliament. As noted at that time, the Government considered it to be important that there should be an independent and objective audit of policies and practices in regard to Australia's uranium exports to ensure that they contributed to and strengthened Australia's pursuit of its disarmament and non-proliferation objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to the Australian Science and Technology Council report indicated the manner in which it is addressing the wide range of issues examined in the inquiry.

<PARA> On 30 July 1955, the then Minister for External Affairs issued a general invitation, in the form of a press statement, welcoming the interest of other countries in the coming International Geophysical Year (1957-58) and offering to provide assistance to anyone desiring to carry out scientific research in the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Available statistics indicate that about 28,000 units of used or reconditioned petrol car engines were imported into Australia over the period January to August this year. Figures prior to this period are unavailable as imports of used car engines were not recorded separately. The question of assistance to the automotive engine reconditioning industry was referred to the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) on 19 September in response to a request for assistance by the Engine Reconditioner's Association of Australia. The IAC has been requested to submit its final report by 18 September 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian engine reconditioning industry has claimed that used engines exported from Japan no longer meet Japanese pollution standards. My Department is seeking further information on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department has no responsibility for ensuring that imported motors meet Australian standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Motor Vehicle Certification Board, comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, States and Territories administers a national certification system for new vehicles to ensure that they comply with appropriate safety and environmental standards.

<PARA> (1) This information is not collected by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission.</PARA>

The figures exclude indirect or overhead costs such as those associated with research only staff, library facilities, central administration and student services. If an imputed value for such items were added, based on the average for the system, the total recurrent cost per medical student (WSU) would be in the range $11,000-$13,000 for 1983 (Est.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As the Commissioner of Taxation is responsible for the administration of the income tax law, his advice was sought as to the ships that have attracted, or will attract, the special taxation concessions available for Australian trading ships. The Commissioner has advised that, because the income tax secrecy provisions prohibit the divulging of information about a person's taxation affairs, he is unable to provide the specific advice sought. My Department's records show that, up to the end of October 1985, manning notices have been issued for 13 ships.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner of Taxation advises that if all the ships in respect of which manning notices have been issued to that date were to qualify for the special taxation concessions, the estimated total cost to the revenue of the special concessions, for the period 1983-84 to 1988-89, would be $70m. Of this amount, $48m would be in respect of depreciation deductions and $22m in respect of investment allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The legislation requires a manning notice to specify the manning level required to enable a ship to be operated in a safe and efficient manner. In issuing a manning notice, the Secretary to the Department of Transport pays regard to the following criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> A ship is considered to be operated in a safe manner if, in his view, there are sufficient numbers of qualified officers and crew to allow the vessel to meet the safety requirements of the Navigation Act and to comply with the provisions of the relevant international conventions, particularly the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping.</PARA>
<PARA> A ship is considered to be operating efficiently if its manning level is such as to ensure commercial efficiency, including economy of operation. In reaching a judgement on this, the Secretary takes into account</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the current training and experience level of available Australian crews</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the present state in development of modern shipboard practices among Australian crews</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the details of the ship and its trade</PARA>
<PARA> (d) crewing levels on efficient, comparable, foreign flag ships.</PARA>
<PARA> The determination of a safe and efficient manning level is undertaken on a ship by ship basis and varies according to ship type, trade and equipment on board. Of the five manning notices issued, for new dry bulk carriers, four were for levels of 26 and one for 27. Comparable bulk carriers in operation under the Australian flag have crews in the range of 31-35. Many of these vessels have been in service for a number of years and do not incorporate the level of technology available on modern vessels.</PARA>
<PARA> A survey of North European and Japanese flag dry bulk carriers built since 1980 that have called at Australian ports shows that the average crew on the North European ships is 23.5 and on Japanese ships 20.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. In 1973 and 1974 the Materials Research Laboratories (MRL) conducted tests on fuel air explosives in canisters at the Puckapunyal Army Range. To describe the work as a development might suggest that the technology breakthrough was Australian. The technology already existed overseas and it was applied here to ensure that our defence scientists understood the technology sufficiently well to be able to provide soundly based advice to the Minister and to the Services in case these weapons emerged as options for Australian Defence. It should be emphasised that these were research tests and not weapon developments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The issue of fuel air explosives (FAE) was the subject of a resolution introduced in 1978 by Sweden and Mexico at the first preparatory committee meeting of the United Nations Conference on Prohibitions or Restrictions of Use of certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurous or to have Indiscriminate Effects (commonly know as the Inhumane Weapons Conference). The resolution called for the banning of FAE for anti-personnel use. The question of FAE was not discussed in any depth at either the preparatory committee meetings or at the conference itself and accordingly was not covered in the draft convention and protocols adopted by the conference.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. I am not able to say whether President Carter refused to authorise the sale of US FAE weapons to Israel, though such was widely alleged in news reports at that time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of any United States proposal on a chemical weapons ban for consideration at the forthcoming Summit between President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev. Australia would strongly support discussion of a chemical weapons ban at the Summit.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) On 18 April 1984 the United States Vice President, Mr George Bush, tabled in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva a draft Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The objective of the United States draft Convention was to ban the production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons. The draft Convention also included prohibitions on preparations for the use of chemical weapons and assistance to anyone to develop stockpiles or use chemical weapons, and provided for the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities. The basic prohibitions in the draft Convention met all major Australian requirements and was welcomed at the time by the Australian delegation to the Conference on Disarmament. Since then Australia has worked to ensure that the draft receives full consideration by all countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States draft Convention contained unprecedented verification measures including the `open invitation' principle, whereby all military and government-owned or controlled facilities can be subject to mandatory international on-site inspection upon request to ensure that there are no hidden stocks or undeclared production of chemical weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Soviet Union has strongly criticised the verification provisions of the United States draft Convention. It has claimed that the references to government-owned or controlled facilities in the United States draft Convention discriminates against socialist systems where all facilities are government-controlled. The United States has replied that no discrimination was intended and it is prepared to negotiate the point. Australia is concerned to ensure that the verification provisions in a future CW Convention apply consistently to both private and government-controlled facilities so that the international community is reassured that there is no diversion from commercial use to the production of chemical weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been active in urging all concerned to seek negotiated solutions to such problems and has welcomed United States assurances that its draft has not been presented on a `take-it-or-leave-it' basis and that the United States is prepared to negotiate on its contents. To date, however, the Soviet Union has not been prepared to offer alternatives to the United States provisions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The Defence Force uses its Macchi jet aircraft solely in the training role for which they were designed. As part of this function, a small number of Macchi aircraft has been modified to train newly graduated pilots in ground attack skills prior to their progressing to fighter and strike aircraft. The Macchi aircraft in Defence Force service could be modified to perform limited ground attack tasks.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Dedicated ground attack aircraft were considered by my Department in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of the new Tactical Fighter Force considerations. It was recognised then that the new-generation multi-role fighter aircraft, with the capacity to perform not only the standard fighter roles but also ground attack tasks, had distinct advantages in Australia's strategic circumstances. In consequence, the decision was made in 1982 to procure 75 F/A18s, which possess very substantial ground attack capabilities. Dedicated attack aircraft tend to be specialised and not necessarily appropriate to Australia's strategic priorities. For example, the A-10 Thunderbolt is designed primarily as an anti-tank aircraft employing its armour-piercing gun capability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Commonwealth payments to Queensland in the three years 1982-83 to 1984-85 comprised general revenue payments-largely tax sharing grants-a range of Commonwealth specific purpose payments including general revenue assistance for on-passing to local government authorities, and Queensland's share of the State Governments' Loan Council `borrowing' program which includes a capital grant component under the Financial Agreement. Local government authorities in Queensland also receive some limited assistance paid directly from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> Table 1 provides a summary of funds made available to the Queensland Government in 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85 under these arrangements. Table 2 provides figures on Commonwealth specific purpose payments to the Queensland Government in the fields of education, health and welfare. These figures do not, of course, include Commonwealth payments direct to Queensland residents for these purposes. More details about these funds and arrangements governing their allocation are provided in the 1985-86 issue of the Budget Paper No. 7 titled `Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Comparisons of expenditures in specific areas from State budgets are not reliable due to the differences in the coverage of the State budgets. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) collects data which are comparable across the Commonwealth and State/Territory levels of Government. Table 3 provides ABS estimates of expenditures on health, welfare and education by Queensland, the five other States, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory for 1982-83 (the latest year for which comparable figures are available).</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (6) The Accounting Standards Review Board has indicated to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities its concern over criticisms in the media and elsewhere as to the delay in producing approved accounting standards. The main reasons for the delay have been identified by the Board as being the need to resolve with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the Australian Society of Accountants (the `joint accounting bodies') a number of difficult and complex threshold issues which affected the drafting style, content and copyright ownership of all future standards. However, following extensive consultations by the Board with the joint accounting bodies, and involving my Department and the National Companies and Securities Commission, the Board now believes that these fundamental issues have been substantially resolved. Hence, on 17 September 1985 the Board approved two accounting standards submitted by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation (AARF) as, respectively, `ASRB 1001 Accounting Policies-Disclosure' and `ASRB 1002 Events Occurring After Balance Date'. Nevertheless the Board accepts the need for the production of approved standards to be accelerated considerably in the future. On 18 October 1985 the Board announced that AARF has advised that it will be submitting four further proposed standards for approval by the Board. The Board said that it welcomed comments from the public on the suitability of the proposed accounting standards. The topics dealt with by each proposed standard are, respectively, `Disclosure of Revenue', `Accounting for Leases', `Accounting for Interests in Joint Ventures' and `Foreign Currency Translation'.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Proposed accounting standards have been submitted to the Board by the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Australian Shareholders' Association. The standard submitted by the NCSC was approved on 27 September 1985 as `ASRB 1003 Foreign Currency Translation-Disclosure'. In the case of the proposed standard on Consolidation submitted by the Australian Shareholders' Association, the Board has advised the Association that it requires additional material as set down in its Procedures. The Board will commence its review of that proposed standard as soon as this material is made available by the Association.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Banks are not required by statute to retain any documents relating to financial transactions involving their customers. Nevertheless, in 1978, at the request of the then Treasurer, banks agreed voluntarily to retain current account vouchers (paid cheques, deposit slips, other debit and credit vouchers) for a minimum period of four years. Depending on their own commercial requirements and practices, some banks and non-bank financial institutions do retain these records for periods longer than four years and do, of course, retain other documents for varying periods.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (5) Several Royal Commissioners and Special Prosecutors have reported that the current minimum four year period for the retention of records observed by banks has created difficulties for law enforcement and taxation authorities and have recommended an extension of this period. The Government currently has this matter under review in the context of formulating its response to the recommendations in this and related areas of the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, headed by Mr Costigan, QC.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that the Commonwealth generally has the constitutional power to enact legislation requiring the retention of records by banks and other financial institutions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Government decided to grant a $3 a day increase in the maximum rate of Commonwealth nursing home benefit payable in respect of patients accommodated in non-government nursing homes in South Australia and the Northern Territory with effect from 14 November 1985. This increase reflects the additional costs arising from the introduction of a 38 hour working week in the nursing home industry in April 1985.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4124" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DAWSON">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Departmental files and papers may be referred to the Australian Federal Police in connection with possible offences against the Social Security Act or in connection with the fraudulent negotiation of cheques.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of files and papers held by the Australian Federal Police at the end of July 1985 in connection with possible offences against the Social Security Act was 1166.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics are not maintained for the number of fraudulently negotiated cheques with AFP at any one time but on average 1400 cases a month were reported to AFP during 1984/85.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Cases referred to the AFP for investigation of possible offences against the Social Security Act include those referred for investigation of the extent of possible offences. Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate the amount involved until it has been established that the reference involves an offence and the extent of the offence has been established.</PARA>
<PARA> For fraudulent negotiation of cheques details of the amounts involved in cases referred to the AFP at any particular time are not maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Special Minister of State has advised that he has been informed by the AFP that during the 6 month period from February to July 1985 a total of 2687 referrals were investigated or were under investigation by the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Section 7 of the Social Security Act places responsibility for the administration of that Act upon the Secretary of the Department. The Secretary or his delegates may refer cases involving suspected offences against the Social Security Act to the AFP where the circumstances suggest that investigation by Departmental officers would not be appropriate. Examples include instances where multiple claims have been made or complex investigations are likely to be involved or where there is a perceived threat to the personal safety of staff if departmental officers were to undertake the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as fraudulent negotiation of cheques is concerned, all Australian Government Departments are required by the Department of Finance to advise AFP of these occurrences where they relate to negotiation of cheques drawn on an official bank account.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Special Minister of State has advised that he has been informed by the AFP that deployment of staff to more pressing tasks and in areas of greater priority designated by the Government has prevented the AFP from investigating all matters referred by my Department. The Government is addressing the problem of AFP resources by the provision of additional funds during this and the next two financial years for the recruitment of a stronger AFP. Further, officers of my Department and the AFP are at the preliminary stages of negotiating working arrangements/guidelines for the investigation of social security fraud which will streamline referral/investigative procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also pointed out that the incidence of fraudulently negotiated cheques has, and will continue, to fall as payment by cheque is increasingly superseded by direct credit payments to the clients of the Department of Social Security. As at June 1985, 86 per cent of all pensions, 84 per cent of all unemployment and sickness benefits and 90 per cent of all family allowance payments were made by direct credit to a bank, building society or credit union.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr Milton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 11 September 1985:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Australian on 23 July 1985 reporting that a preliminary Congressional study of chemical risks has suggested a link between high rates of respiratory cancer and the sites of petrochemical plants in the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Can he state whether any similar studies have been conducted in Australia; if so, what are the details.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If no studies of this kind have been conducted, will he take steps to establish a monitoring body in his Department to conduct such studies on a national basis.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4138" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="LA TROBE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department is not aware of any studies of populations located in the vicinity of any petro-chemical plants in Australia. However a health surveillance program of the Australian petroleum industry, titled `Health Watch' is currently being undertaken by a team of researchers based in the University of Melbourne. This program is monitoring the health status of those currently employed at such plants and maintains contact with resigned and retired employees. It is specifically designed to detect health problems in those exposed to long hours to emissions from these plants.</PARA>
<PARA> Initial findings concerning the incidence of cancer, released in the `Health Watch' fourth Annual Report 1984, suggest that workers in the industry as a whole are not at any greater risk of premature death than the Australian population in general. Future investigations will attempt to classify broad categories of jobs in terms of exposure and potential exposure to chemical substances and thus begin to narrow the focus onto particular jobs and categories.</PARA>
<PARA> I shall make a copy of the report available to the honourable member if he so desires.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is generally accepted that workers in petrochemical plants would usually have higher exposures to materials and pollutants from those plants than the general community. In view of the on-going nature of the `Health Watch' Study and its findings to date, I am advised that there are no indications for the Government to initiate additional studies at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his Department or any authority under his control installed new security or alarm systems during 1984-85; if so, what was the cost of the equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is the installation of new security equipment proposed in 1985-86; if so what is the estimated cost of the equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does the installation of this equipment incur additional monitoring costs; if so, what are they.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Yes-$271,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes-$2,550 estimated for 1985-86.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the above figures represent only those systems installed and funded by the Department of Social Security.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Sugar Industry Working Party Report recommended a price support level for the 1985 season of $220 per tonne. Based on the 1984 costs of production figures this would cover cash operating costs including growers' own labour for around 43 per cent of growers. However, this estimate does not necessarily reflect the overall viability of cane growers as the survey takes no account of non-cane income and other off-farm income available to the grower. Hence the proportion of growers at risk is nowhere near 57 per cent and is generally considered to be no more than about 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Federal Government announced on 23 September 1985 an assistance package for the sugar industry totalling $150m over three years to cover price support, adjustment assistance and research funding. The levels of support to No. 1 Pool are $230 in 1985, $225 in 1986 and $220 in 1987. This is a more generous offer than that recommended by the Savage Committee and, if accepted, would mean more direct cash grants to sugar growers than any Government has given to a particular primary industry for many years. The Commonwealth offer is conditional both on State participation in the price support scheme and a preparedness on the part of the industry to accept a degree of deregulation sufficient to achieve a level of cost reduction necessary to compete at future price levels. The New South Wales Government is prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government but the Queensland Government Government is not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) In May 1984 industrial action in the computer section of the Department of Health and Social Security (`DHSS') Newcastle-upon-Tyne, delayed payments to British pensioners residing in Australia. There were no computer issued payments are 11 May 1984 until after the strike concluded in January 1985. However, emergency procedures were put in place by DHSS and the British High Commission in Australia whereby British pensioners were able to write to DHSS to obtain manual payment of their pensions. These arrangements were made in June 1984 with the assistance of my Department which was able to inform pensioners of the arrangements and assist in communications between pensioners, the High Commission and DHSS.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Advice to my Department from DHSS was that, by November 1984, all British pensioners in Australia were receiving their British pensions regularly through the manual arrangements. When the strike ended normal payment by computer was resumed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) United Kingdom pensions are paid 4-weekly or quarterly. Under the manual arrangements for the payment of United Kingdom pensions lump sum arrears were paid during the period June 1984 to November 1984 but, at most, only one extra payment of UK pension would have been paid to 30 June 1985. Because of the difference between the pensioner tax threshold and the maximum Australian pension rate, it is unlikely that the DHSS strike would have caused any pensioner to rise above the tax threshold for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Under the Social Security Act 1947 income is taken into account when it is `earned, derived or received'. Although some United Kingdom pensioners were not actually receiving their United Kingdom pension for a time, income was derived and was taken into account in the usual way to calculate the rate of Australian pension payable. A lump sum payment received later would therefore not have led to a reduction in Australian pension and averaging is not considered necessary.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Can he indicate whether Tasmania comes under the south-eastern footprint of the Aussat satellite; if so what programs will be able to be received by Tasmanian television viewers?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What effect is Aussat programming expected to have on Tasmanian regional (a) Australian Broadcasting Corporation and (b) commercial programs?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4164" SPEAKER="Duffy The Hon M.J." NAMEID="6G4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="LYONS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-ABC-is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Tasmania will come under the south-eastern footprint of the Aussat satellite. Services available for direct reception from the satellite will be the ABC Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service-HACBSS 1-due to be inaugurated on 26 January 1986; this will be followed sometime later by the Remote Commercial Television Service-RCTS-on HACBSS 2.</PARA>
<PARA> The HACBSS 1 ABC television program will be identical to that transmitted throughout the south-eastern footprint, which covers New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> It is to be noted, however, that the great majority of residents in Tasmania will continue to be served from conventional terrestrial transmitters, programmed from the ABC's television studios in Tasmania. Apart from the existing transmission system, my Department is continuing to expand the network of television transmitters throughout Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The availability of Aussat will have little direct effect on programming to the present ABC television retransmission facilities in Tasmanian regional areas. However, use of the satellite for closed-circuit-non-broadcast-interchange of material between studio centres by the ABC, will enable wider and more immediate coverage of news and current events throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Three ABC radio programs will be beamed over the entire state; regional listeners will be able to receive these radio services by installing the appropriate satellite equipment. Over time, the ABC intends extending three radio services to all regional areas by conventional transmitter, but the satellite will allow listeners to receive them sooner. The HACBSS radio programs include national radio services, Radio 2 and Stereo FM; Regional Radio 1 will also be available.</PARA>
<PARA> Regional Radio 1 is a new country radio service specially developed by the ABC for its satellite services and will consist of news, current affairs, discussion and music based around the interests of the entire south-eastern footprint.</PARA>
<PARA> Radio 2 is essentially a national spoken word radio network, with a percentage of transmission time devoted to state-based programmes.</PARA>
<PARA> Stereo FM is a national stereo radio service presented from Adelaide, but with contributions from around Australia. It features the best in performing arts, particularly music and drama.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) Once the satellite is fully operational, commercial operators could have the capacity to deliver programs to all commercial television stations in Australia. This would increase the choice of programming available to the regional stations. Outside the service areas of existing regional commercial television stations, primarily remote areas, commercial programming will be available via direct reception from the satellite, of the RCTS service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Australia has been seeking to ensure that EEC subsidies have the minimum possible impact on our markets. The objective through the Andriessen agreement was to restrict the use of subsidies as much as possible. A large number of countries including Hong Kong were considered by Australia in the run-up to negotiations with the EEC for inclusion in an agreement limiting the use of subsidies. Following negotiations, the agreement finally reached relates to a list of countries which did not include Hong Kong and some others. However, Australia's central objective was to ensure EEC subsidised beef was excluded from our major markets. Leaving aside the United States of America and Canada where reliance is being placed on other mechanisms to contain EEC competition, the Andriessen agreement covers almost 85 per cent of Australia's export markets for beef and veal.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Official Hong Kong statistics show imports of beef and veal from EEC countries from the beginning of February 1985 to the end of September as 208 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to say precisely how much of this trade has been subsidised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) State and Federal legislation in the primary industry area overlaps only in the sense that provisions of State and Federal laws might apply to the same products or to the same activity. Because of constitutional and other constraints, however, there is no overlap in the legal sense-Federal legislation relates to international and interstate trade elements; State legislation relates to intra-State elements such as production, land use, pricing and transport.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of these divisions of power, it is often necessary for the States and the Commonwealth to pass complementary legislation to implement an agreed program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) See (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As part of the Government's program of business deregulation, all Commonwealth primary industry legislation is being reviewed on a continuing basis.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, where it has been found that the practical implementation of complementary State and Federal legislation is imposing unnecessary costs, the Commonwealth has moved to remedy that situation by seeking the States' agreement to refer to the Commonwealth their powers on the issues concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation in conjunction with Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australia) Limited and W. Angliss and Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd., on 19 April 1984, lodged a formal complaint with the United States Court of International Trade seeking a judgment that under the Meat Import Act 1979 and the Agricultural Act 1956, the Meat Import Act's minimum access floor of 1.25 billion pounds for meat imports acts as an absolute minimum limit on aggregate US Meat Imports.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States Meat Import Law requires the administration to impose quotas on supplying countries when estimated imports exceed a trigger level. The trigger level is calculated by a formula specified in the legislation. The United States Government was able to avoid imposing quotas in 1983 by the negotiation of voluntary restraint agreements with major suppliers including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1984 the Court of International Trade refused to grant an injunction to prevent the United States Government negotiating voluntary restraint agreements with supplying countries which limit US imports to less than the minimum access floor of 1.25 billion pounds annually. It was found that the 1979 Act did not restrict the President from negotiating voluntary restraint levels below the 1.25 billion pound minimum. The court did find that the United States action of restricting imports below the guaranteed floor level did cause material injury to the Australian Industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The AMLC sought clarification of the judgment to determine whether the President has the discretion to negotiate voluntary restraint levels to the minimum access floor level even where the trigger level was below that floor. The court however declined to offer a judgment on the question as it was considered to be hypothetical at that time. The AMLC and the two exporters were invited to bring the matter before the court if the circumstances should actually arise.</PARA>
<PARA> To date these circumstances have not arisen and accordingly the matter is in abeyance.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Department is currently undertaking a review of the role, powers and functions of the Australian Honey Board.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Defence has sourced approximately 314 munitions items from overseas suppliers during the past decade and is currently procuring an additional 97 such items. These items are predominantly special ammunition types or components which cannot be produced in Australia with due economy. Defence currently makes no significant purchases of finished ammunition products from commercial sources in Australia although there are many local suppliers of the raw and processed materials used for the production of such items.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 May 1985:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister's Department, or any statutory authority or organisation for which the Minister is responsible, employed consultants since March 1983; if so, (a) who has been employed, (b) for what purpose, (c) what working plan was given to them, (d) what was the cost of their services, (e) when did their services commence and finish, and (f) was any fee in excess of the initial quote; if so, by what amount.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4191" SPEAKER="Morris The Hon P.F." NAMEID="HI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RICHMOND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr Peter Morris</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Department of Transport</PARA>
<PARA> (a), (b), (d) and (e) Relevant information has been provided in the answer to question No. 445 asked by Mr Ruddock on 26 March 1985. Details have been forwarded to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) and (f) It is the practice to send a commissioning letter to all consultants defining and framing the task to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> The general practice is that consultancies are subject to fixed fee arrangements. Requests for price variations submitted by consultants will only be approved for demonstrated direct cost increases which are reasonably regarded as beyond the control of the consultant and also beyond normal commercial risks. Where the Department alters the scope of work any additional cost must likewise be demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that substantial departmental resources would need to be diverted from normal duties to provide the more detailed information sought by the honourable member in relation to individual consultancy arrangements. I am therefore not prepared to authorise diversion of resources for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Authorities</PARA>
<PARA> As Minister for Transport I am responsible for two statutory authorities-the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) and the Australian Shipping Commission (ANL).</PARA>
<PARA> Both AN and ANL are required by legislation to operate as commercial undertakings. I am therefore not prepared to provide information which may prejudice their commercial operations, nor am I prepared to direct them to incur the substantial expenditure involved in collating the detailed information sought by the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA>Inter-State Commission</PARA>
<PARA> I am also responsible for administration of the Inter-State Commission Act 1975 which provides for the operation of the Inter-State Commission (ISC), an authority established by the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to consultants engaged by the Inter-State Commission, I am advised as follows:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr Hurford</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department does not provide local call access to clients to Regional or Area Offices, nor is it proposed to install 008 telephone numbers for this purpose in the immediate future.</PARA>
<PARA> By its very nature, my Department is in daily contact with a wide variety and vast numbers of clients of different backgrounds with whom it has dealings over a range of issues (e.g. migration, sponsorship, citizenship, residence, departure tax, passports (Darwin), post-arrival services etc).</PARA>
<PARA> However, Departmental activities which come closest to being community support services are the post-arrival programs and services provided to migrants and refugees. By definition these are services which are directed towards an identified group rather than the whole community. At the last Census, in 1981, some 80% of all migrants (including refugees) were resident in a capital city or in a major urban centre where my Department has a Regional Office (e.g. Sydney, Melbourne, etc.) or an Area Office (e.g. Albury/Wodonga, Wollongong, Townsville, etc.). This is true of an even larger percentage of migrants who have been in Australia for less than five years, and who are likely to have more need of specialised post-arrival services than migrants of longer residence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given serious consideration to the introduction of a toll-free (008) telephone service by which all migrants, irrespective of their place of residence, could contact my Department's Telephone Interpreter Service (TIS) for assistance with interpreters or for information and referral. Already, automatic call diverters and tie-lines link nine areas of significant migrant population with TIS in the nearest capital city for the cost of a local call. Other priorities, such as the purchase of new telephone equipment and the development of a community resource index, both intended to enhance the quality of service by TIS, have meant that the provision of the toll-free facility covering the whole of Australia has had to be deferred.</PARA>
<PARA> Only a small proportion of my Department's clientele is in the position of not having access either in person or by telephone to a local office of my Department. This, together with financial and practical considerations (including the real possibility that the provision of the 008 facility might tend to encourage unnecessary calls thus disrupting workflows and service to other clients) militate against the provision of the 008 facility to individuals at the taxpayers expense.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report from the Interim Committee for the Australian Sports Commission makes no reference whatsoever to any intention to make the organisations mentioned in the question subservient to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Although it is not clear in the question, I assume that the honourable member has drawn his wholly erroneous inferences from those sections of the report which emphasise that, so far as recommending and overseeing funding from the Commonwealth Government for sports development is concerned, the Commission should be the pre-eminent authority. In performing that role, which is entirely appropriate and necessary, the Commission in no way seeks to influence or undermine the status and authority of individual associations. That has already been substantially recognised by the sporting community itself. At the most recent annual meeting of the Australian Olympic Federation, an organisation cited by the honourable member in his question, the role and potential of the Commission was endorsed and supported in the strongest terms.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would draw the honourable member's attention to a key paragraph on page 9 of the Interim Report in the section entitled `The report: An Overview'. The Interim Committee states quite unequivocally:</PARA>
<PARA> This report emphasises that the establishment of the Sports Commission will not reduce the autonomy or independence of sports organisations, umbrella groups or Governments. The Interim Committee believes that such independence is vital to the development of sport, and indeed, is enshrined in the constitution of bodies such as the Australian Olympic Federation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 November 1985:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that (a) the Defence Force Service Awards were instituted in May 1980 and (b) there are many thousands of serving members of the Defence Forces, both permanent and Reserve, who although qualified for these awards have yet to be gazetted.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Are the delays from gazettal to issue of the Defence Force Service Awards in excess of 18 months; if so, has he discussed with the Minister for Administrative Services what action can be taken to stop such delays occuring.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is it a fact that the percentage of Air Force Service Awards issued to the Reserve and ex-permanent members serving in the Reserve is significantly less than the Reserve percentages in the other 2 services.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) No. The Defence Force Service Awards were formally instituted by Her Majesty The Queen on 20 April 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, medal entitlements are generally despatched within 3-5 months from gazettal. There have been infrequent occasions however, where, due to such difficulties as locating members the medal entitlement has been delayed beyond 12 months. It would be a most unlikely situation where the despatch of the medal was delayed by 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No it is not a fact that the percentage of Air Force Service Awards issued to Reserves is significantly less than the other two Services. The Air Force figure is slightly under 2 percent as in Navy's. The figure for Army is in the order of 24 per cent which reflects a higher proportion of Reserves as a part of the total Army force.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As the 1982 amendments to the National Medal Regulations removed members of the Defence Force from the categories of persons eligible to qualify for the Medal, the question is not applicable.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) It is a normal part of my Department's operations that alternative means of meeting capability requirements are assessed. Alternatives are generally assessed for their contributions to Australia's particular strategic situation and could include changes to existing equipment or other resources if other more appropriate approaches are identified. An important element of such investigations is the financial implications, without which a judgment on relative priorities would be deficient.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department employs external consultants to provide technical advice on many issues; eg. environmental issues, detailed design, technology or production questions. Details of the broader investigations being undertaken by Messrs Dibb and Cooksey are provided below.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the very large number of capability analyses undertaken by my Department and the level of security classification attached to most studies of this type, I am not in a position to provide the full range of details sought.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) Aside from the Departmental consultants mentioned above, two consultants have been appointed by the Government to address major policy matters that may be relevant in the context of the honourable member's questions-Mr Paul Dibb and Mr Robert Cooksey.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dibb is conducting a review of Australia's defence capabilities. His salary is $63,972 per annum plus an expense of office allowance of $1,900.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Robert Cooksey is conducting reviews of Australia's defence co-operation program and policy on the export of defence equipment. His salary is $50,504 per annum plus an expenses of office allowance of $815.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has asked identical questions of both the Attorney-General and me, as indicated by the above question numbers. With the concurrence of the Attorney-General, I provide the following answer to the honourable member's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The labelling of pharmaceutical products has been of concern to my Department for a number of years. As a result an Order entitled `General Requirements for Labels for Therapeutic Goods' has been developed by the Therapeutic Goods Standards Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The draft Order specifies the information to be included on labels applied to containers and primary packs of a wide range of pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA> The labelling requirements address, amongst others, the points raised in the honourable member's question under-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the generic name;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the nature and uses of the product;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) dosage and administration guides and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) storage life and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> Limitations of available space on labels preclude the inclusion of information under-</PARA>
<PARA> (d) unwanted effects and contraindications;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) multi-lingual explanations and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) mandatory explanations of side effects,</PARA>
<PARA>and this information is normally included in product literature which may accompany the product or can be found in product reference books.</PARA>
<PARA> A final draft of the Order which has involved extensive consultation with industry, Government and user groups will be considered for adoption under the Therapeutic Goods Act by the Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event that the Order is acceptable to the Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee the requirements will become mandatory for all goods covered by the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Act. The individual States and Territories have agreed, in principle, to draft complementary legislation to ensure the requirements are uniformly applied throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department has not been able to determine the point of difference between French and Australian policy regarding disclosure of efficacy.</PARA>
<PARA> The detailed data submitted by a company to the Australian Government are regarded as confidential. Claims of efficacy are subjected to careful assessment by my Department and the independent Australian Drug Evaluation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department reviews promotional claims by companies against these assessments. The Australian mechanism for drug evaluation has worked well and is regarded internationally as one of the best.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4201" SPEAKER="Bowen The Hon L.F." NAMEID="ZE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="JAGAJAGA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I do not propose to provide detailed information on the specific matters raised. The work involved in answering in detail would exceed what is customarily accepted for answers to parliamentary questions and I am not prepared to divert the resources of my Department for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am not able to provide a detailed break up in response to this question, but the following material was reasonably accessible and is provided in partial answer. The Attorney-General's Department receives information from agencies subject to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act on their costs of operating under the Act for the purpose of publication in the Attorney-General's Annual Report to Parliament on the operation of the Act. The Annual Report for 1983-84 reported that fees paid to legal counsel amounted to $24,897. The 1984-85 Annual Report reports that fees paid to legal counsel amounted to $107,865. Specific records on the cost of defending appeals in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), and the Federal Court have not been maintained. No FOI case has yet been heard by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) My Department gives legal advice on the FOI Act to Commonwealth bodies in the normal performance of its functions. In addition the FOI Act recognises the role of the Attorney-General's Department in assisting agencies to comply with their obligations under the Act. It requires that the Annual Report on the Act describe the relevant activities undertaken by the Department: see Chapter 3 of the 1982-83 Annual Report and Chapter 5 of both the 1983-84 Annual Report and the 1984-85 Annual Report. In addition to the work undertaken by the FOI Branch of my Department, the Australian Government Solicitor represents many agencies in relation to proceedings under the FOI Act as in any other situation. Some statutory bodies receive legal advice on FOI matters from legal advisors in their own staff or from private legal practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Attorney-General's Department provides legal advice or assistance on request to all agencies in respect of the Act or proceedings thereunder and the Australian Government Solicitor represents agencies in appeal proceedings on instruction. It is a matter for each agency to consider whether it will seek legal advice or assistance on FOI matters, except where proceedings in a Court are involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There are no special guidelines limiting expenditure on legal assistance in respect of the Freedom of Information Act or proceedings brought under the Act. However, pursuant to Finance Direction 13/7 and 13/8, claims for payment of legal costs shall not be certified in accordance with section 34 (2) of the Audit Act 1901 unless they have been endorsed fair and reasonable by the Secretary, Attorney-General's Department or a Director of Legal Services or an officer appointed by him. Also, where the Australian Government Solicitor acts for a Department or agency, the Australian Government Solicitor has a role in determining whether counsel should be engaged and, if counsel is to be engaged, has the final responsibility for the selection of counsel.</PARA>
<PARA> On 14 June 1985 it was announced that the Government has decided that agencies should reimburse the Australian Government Solicitor in defending FOI cases in the AAT and the Federal Court. This is consistent with the provisions of section 29/1 of the Finance Directions.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Measures have been taken to avoid any difficulties resulting from the performance of the dual responsibilities. For example, my Department in its role as the Department responsible for administering the Act might advise an agency not to contest an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a decision made by the agency under the Act and, if the agency was not dissuaded from contesting the appeal, my Department would bring the matter to my notice. It has been arranged, however, that in such circumstances the Australian Government Solicitor would continue to act in the ordinary way as solicitor on the instructions of the client agency. Also, measures have been taken within my Department with a view to ensuring co-ordination of advice as to prospects of resisting an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and advice generally under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) There have been three recommendations in accordance with sub-section 66 (1). Decisions in respect of each have yet to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) This matter could be considered in the context of a general review of the FOI Act which is expected next year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) At the time the Government announced that the tourism industry was to be excluded from the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme, effective from 20 May 1985, it indicated that the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism would be bringing forward separate proposals for providing assistance to the industry. Subsequently, on 19 June 1985, the Acting Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, the Hon Peter Morris, announced the introduction of the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme, effective from 20 May 1985.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 August 1985:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that (a) certain provisions of the Companies Code concern defaulting and/or fraudulent company directors, (b) the courts have applied strict interpretations in dealing with the component of fraud in fraudulent transactions and (c) s.556(1) of the Code and its associated provisions could be a major weapon in the armoury against misfeasance.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has his attention been drawn to (a) the statements by Mr James Farmer in his publication `Creditor and Debtor Law' which hailed s.556(3) of the Code as a boon to liquidators stating that they would not have to wait for convictions before bringing in funds under ss.556(1) and (3) and (b) the judgment of Young J. in the New South Wales Supreme Court Ross, McConnel Kitchen &amp;Co. Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Ross and Ors (1985) 3ACLC 326, 329) which held that only creditors could bring actions under s.556(3).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are s.556(3) proceedings available to creditors only and not liquidators who are able to assess whether or not s.556(1) applies; if so (a) why and (b) will the provisions be amended to make Parliament's intention clear.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is it a fact that (a) s.557(1) allows the court to make a declaration of personal liability where a director has been found guilty of reckless trading and (b) a recovery from a director by the creditor will result in a reduction of the amount of indebtedness of a company; if so, why is the `prescribed person' not given standing under s.557(1) to apply for a declaration of liability.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is it a fact that ss.557(1) and 556(3) restrict the court in the order it may wish to make in that it must make an order or give judgment in favour of the creditor; if so, will he amend the legislation to give the courts a broader discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Is it a fact that s.556(1) substantially re-enacts the provisions of s.374C, UCA, in that a controlling director of a company can say that he is prepared to support the company at the time the debt is incurred and then later refuse that support and not pay, leaving the company with no means of paying the creditor; if so, will he take urgent steps to amend the provision to outlaw or discourage this behaviour; if not, why not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) In certain circumstances ss.556 and 557 of the Companies Code impose civil and criminal liability on company directors for the debts or fraudulent conduct of a company.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Similar provisions dealing with fraud in earlier legislation have been interpreted by the courts as requiring proof of actual dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Section 556(1) may render the directors and persons involved in the management of a company civilly and criminally liable for a debt of the company if immediately before the debt was incurred there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts as they fell due. The section is an important element in the scheme of creditor protection adopted by the Code.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3), (4) and (5) The recent decision of Young J. in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Ross McConnel Kitchen &amp;Co. Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v. Ross &amp;Ors (1985) 3 ACLC 326 was that proceedings for the recovery of a debt under sub-section 556(1) are available to creditors only and not to liquidators.</PARA>
<PARA> Similary, sub-section 557(1) allows the court to make a declaration of personal liability to a creditor where a person has been convicted of an offence under s.556(1). This is quite different from s.557(2) which allows the court, on the application of a `prescribed person' as defined by s.557(3), to make a declaration of personal liability to the company where a person has been convicted of an offence under s.556(5). There seems little point in allowing a `prescribed person', such as a liquidator, to apply in his representative capacity for a declaration under sub-section 557(1) when the benefit will only accrue to an individual creditor. On the other hand, under sub-section 557(2) the liquidator is quite appropriately seeking a declaration of liability for the benefit of the company as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) While s.556(1) is based on s.347C(1), UCA, it has been restructured to place greater responsibility on directors and persons involved in the management of a company at the time when unreasonable debts are incurred. A significant difference relates to the burden of proof. It was an element of the offence under s.347C(1) that the defendant had no reasonable or probable grounds to expect that the company would be able to pay its debts. This placed the burden of proof on the prosecution, making conviction difficult in the case of a director who claimed that at the time the debt was incurred he was prepared to support the company. Under s.556(1) it need only be proved that there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would be unable to pay its debts. The defendant would then have a defence under s.556(2) only if he were able to prove that the debt was incurred without his authority or consent or that he did not have reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) While no statistics are available, it is considered that claims for personal injuries would amount to approximately 3 per cent, and defence of debt recovery actions would amount to approximately 3 to 4 per cent, of the total grants of aid.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The relevant available statistical information distinguishes, for the most part, only between applications for legal aid arising in family law and general law matters. The latter broad category includes civil and criminal matters such as those described in parts (b), (c) and (d) of question (2).</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The number of matters shown as grants in criminal law matters relates only to those applications involving State laws. Figures relating to grants of aid in Commonwealth criminal law matters have not been separately recorded (see note (b) above).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no specific information available as to the average delay between the receipt and the making of a determination on applications. However, I understand that at the present time, unless an application for aid is seen clearly to be urgent (see answer to question (5) below), the time taken to determine an application for aid from its receipt until a letter notifying the decision is despatched is, on average, 7 days.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) Where an application for aid is made to the office that is seen clearly to be urgent, for instance it may have been hand-delivered or preceded by a telephone enquiry, it will be immediately directed for consideration. The usual practice is for the applicant or his or her solicitor to be informed of the decision by telephone before formal notification of the decision is made in writing.</PARA>
<PARA> The office will also consider applications for aid in urgent cases that are made by telephone. If time permits, the solicitor making such a request is asked to submit an application in the usual manner. If it is not possible in the time available for the solicitor to obtain a completed application form from the client the solicitor may be able to submit a letter containing the relevant facts. However, if the matter is of such urgency that an application form cannot be obtained and the solicitor cannot forward a letter regarding the matter, consideration can be given to the application on the facts obtained by telephone. A careful note of the relevant facts is made when the matter is being discussed with the solicitor, including the full name and address of the client, and the solicitor is advised to submit a proper application without delay. If the facts stated in the application confirm the information furnished by telephone the grant of aid will backdate to the date of the telephone conversation. On occasions, aid is granted over the telephone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 11 September 1985:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Minister's Department provide local call access to clients to the district or regional offices of the Department; if not, will the Department consider installing a 008 telephone number so that clients currently without local call access can have equal opportunity to contact the Department for assistance.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4218" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MALLEE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No, there has been no evidence seen by my Department that there could be an appreciable level of demand for such a service or that the usage would justify the cost that the Department would incur.</PARA>
<PARA> The Offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service are located throughout the country, and this should allow for the greater majority of call traffic to be at local rates. Experience has shown that the incidence of STD calls from clients is small.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department does, however, operate arrangements where reverse charge calls from clients concerning services and programs are accepted by State and local offices of the CES. Where there is a likelihood that a client will need to contact the Department from some distance such a client would be advised of this procedure and invited to use it.</PARA>
<PARA> While such instances are not common they do occur in cases concerning the Relocation Assistance Program and in rural locations where CES Offices cover large geographical areas.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the foregoing, the Department does not consider that it is necessary or desirable at this time to introduce toll free calls into its operating system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated above, the honourable member asked identical questions of all Ministers. As Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Industrial Matters, I am responding on behalf of all Ministers, with their concurrence. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In its statutory role as the authority responsible for determining salary and terms and conditions of employment for Public Service Act staff, and consistent with the current industrial co-ordination arrangements, the Public Service Board monitors industrial activity only for those Departments and Authorities in statutory relationship with the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> As the collection and collation of the full range of information sought by the honourable member would impose an unreasonable burden on the resources of departments and authorities, the scope of this answer is limited to such information as is certainly recorded by the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> The information provided to the honourable member covers the period from March 1983 to mid-October 1985. Since 1 June 1984, when the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator was subsumed within Division 1A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, the Board has been advised of industrial disputes in Departments and Authorities in statutory relationship with the Board when a dispute has been formally notified to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. In the case of those disputes that do not reach the stage of formal notification, the Board relies on formal and informal advice from Departments and Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, information is maintained on all industrial disputes in Departments and Authorities in statutory relationship with the Board. This information, in response to the honourable member's question, generally covers the timing and duration of disputes, the types of staff involved, the unions involved, the reasons for the form and location of each dispute and their effects. Given the various forms that industrial disputation can take, it is often not possible precisely to ascertain the numbers of persons involved; for this reason, statistics are not maintained to this level of detail.</PARA>
<PARA> The information is as set out in the following schedule.</PARA>
<PARA> Further to the specific information requested by the honourable member, I would also add that there has been a considerable improvement in industrial relations since this government came to power. During our term of Government, the number of working days lost due to industrial disputes has fallen dramatically to, and remained at, its lowest level for 17 years. This improvement has been assisted by several Government initiatives and, given the honourable member's interest in the Commonwealth public sector, I shall mention those initiatives taken by the Government with respect to its own employees. Arbitration and protection rights have been restored through repeal of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Protection) Act and the `no work as directed, no pay' provisions. Payroll deductions of union dues has been re-instituted and staff-management consultation on, and co-ordination of, occupational health and safety initiatives have been facilitated by the establishment of the Committee on Occupational Health and Safety in Australian Government Employment. In addition, as part of the general reform of the Australian Public Service, provision was made for introduction of industrial democracy and implementation of Equal Employment opportunity programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The basis of eligibility to apply for legal aid from all major legal aid agencies in Australia, that is, State legal aid commissions and the Australian Legal Aid Office, is involvement in a matter arising under Australian law and not nationality or residence. Therefore, as the Parliament has enacted laws which provide legal mechanisms, which include proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia, whereby persons alleged to be prohibited non-citizens can have decisions regarding, or arising out of, their status reviewed, such persons can obtain legal aid for the purpose of exercising their rights under those laws, provided they are eligible under the criteria relating to means and merit applied by the legal aid agency in question and subject to the appropriate conditions imposed by the legal aid agency in question according to the circumstances of the case.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This information is not available, because statistics currently kept by the legal aid agencies and collected by the Commonwealth do not enable matters involving residency status to be specifically identified. However, the Attorney-General's Department has recently asked all major legal aid agencies to participate in a survey, to be undertaken in respect of a defined period in the near future, of legal aid applications from persons alleged to be prohibited non-citizens in respect of matters concerning their status. This survey is designed to provide the Department with statistical information regarding the numbers, nature and cost of matters in which legal aid is granted for such cases. However, it should be emphasised that, in view of both the legislative protection of the confidentiality of information regarding individual clients of State legal aid commissions and the policy of protecting confidentiality in relation to clients of the Australian Legal Aid Office, the survey will provide information for statistical purposes only and will not involve identification of individual cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Apart from minor exceptions in relation to family allowance and family income supplement, citizenship is not a prerequisite for any form of social security. However, all forms of assistance other than special benefits have as a prerequisite specified conditions of residence in Australia (or corresponding residence under a reciprocal agreement). Legal advice has indicated that `residence' for the purpose of the Social Security Act means legal residence, so that prohibited non-citizens (persons without authority to remain in Australia) are not generally entitled to receive social security assistance. However, in certain unusual circumstances special benefit may be paid, eg. where a prohibited non-citizen has applied for regularisation of residence status and is in hardship.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, there are differences between the policies of the UDF and Inkatha. While both are working towards the dismantling of apartheid, the means by which each group seeks to achieve this objective is different. Inkatha has chosen participation in the South African government-created system of homelands. On the other hand, the UDF, which was specifically founded to oppose the new South African constitution, is opposed to any participation in the apartheid system. Inkatha opposes the use of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa, whereas the UDF has repeatedly called for their introduction.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Government has not adopted a specific policy towards the objectives of the Inkatha.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4248" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RICHMOND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, the assets test will apply to people who become eligible for Australian social security benefits under any new reciprocal social security agreement in the same way as it now applies to people who become eligible under the existing agreements and under the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The procedures used to calculate, verify and review the value of pensioners' assets held overseas will be the same as those which apply for pensioners who have assets in Australia. However, a typical reciprocal agreement does include provisions for administrative assistance and it may be possible that some future agreement countries would be prepared to assist in the application of the Australian assets test. This would be a matter for negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Overseas assets, like overseas income are generally valued in the currency of the country concerned and social security agreements frequently include provisions governing the method for valuing one currency in terms of the currency of another. Where there are no such provisions, the relevant exchange rate is used which applies at the time the entitlement is determined or reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) It is not possible to estimate accurately the total number of people who will benefit under reciprocal agreements. In the future, the number of agreements Australia might enter into, the number of people who chose to leave Australia to live abroad and the number of people who might be selected for migration to Australia will all have a bearing on the number of people who might benefit once a network of agreements is in place.</PARA>
<PARA> However, all those people now in Australia who spent part of their lives overseas and contributed to foreign social security systems, and those people who spent part of their working life in Australia and are now overseas, are potential beneficiaries under reciprocity arrangements. My Department estimates this would be well over a million people.</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to estimate the number of people who will benefit under a specific agreement while it is being negotiated. Such estimates are essential to the negotiation process to enable each Government to assess the cost implications of the agreement concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Contracts Review Act 1980 (New South Wales) was assented to on 15 April 1980 and commenced operation on 24 April 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) In February 1984 a Green Paper entitled `The Trade Practices Act-Proposals for Change' was released by the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Cohen, and the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Willis. The Green Paper included a proposal to insert a provision in the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to a contract or proposed contract. Public comment on the Green Paper was invited.</PARA>
<PARA> On 9 October 1985 I introduced into the House of Representatives the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1985, which included many of the proposals contained in the Green Paper, including the `unconscionable conduct' provision (proposed new section 52A of the Trade Practices Act). In the light of public comment received on the Green Paper proposal, the Government decided to restrict the application of the new provision to unconscionable conduct in respect of consumer transactions. As the proposed new section 52A stands, it will protect consumers from unconscionable conduct in their dealings with corporations. The section is designed to cover conduct which, while it may not be false or misleading, is nevertheless unconscionable in all the circumstances. The Office of Consumer Affairs in my Department will be monitoring the operation of the provision to see if it is having the desired effect.</PARA>
<PARA> There are some differences between the New South Wales Contracts Review Act and the new section 52A, though generally speaking they cover the same type of conduct. Section 7 of the Contracts Review Act provides that, where the Court finds a contract or provision of a contract to have been unjust, the Court may grant relief. However, by virtue of section 6, relief can only be granted in respect of non-business contracts made by the complainant or to contracts made for the purpose of a farming undertaking, and in any case relief cannot be granted to a corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of constitutional limitations, Part V of the Trade Practices Act is generally limited to the conduct of corporations. Section 52A will prohibit corporations engaging in unconscionable conduct in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person. The section is not limited to unjust provisions in contracts, but extends to any conduct in connection with a supply or possible supply. Further, relief can be granted to anyone (including corporations), but only in respect of the supply or possible supply of consumer-type goods or services, ie goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use.</PARA>
<PARA> The types of remedies available under the Contracts Review Act and section 52A are basically the same. However, if the Trade Practices Amendment Bill is passed, the Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of aggrieved consumers for breaches of Part V of the Act, including section 52A, rather than consumers having to institute individual actions to obtain redress.</PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Amendment Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 19 November 1985.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 October 1985 (Hansard, page 2144) Mr Ronald Edwards asked the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Attorney-General in his capacity as Minister responsible for consumer affairs. My question relates to an article in yesterday's edition of the Canberra Times, headed `Tarago now safer'. The article states that Toyota is upgrading the safety standards of Toyota Tarago vans. The question at stake is whether previous Toyota Tarago editions may not have been safe in terms of their passenger safety. I note also that there is such a vehicle in the Commonwealth car fleet. Can the Minister advise the House on the current state of discussions in this respect?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Road Safety in the Department of Transport has advised that until 1985, the Toyota Tarago, like most other models of passenger vans, was classified for vehicle certification purposes as a multi-purpose passenger vehicle. The Australian Design Rules (ADRs) applicable to this category of vehicle reflected the commercial vehicle origins of these vans and were, in some areas, less stringent than the requirements for conventional passenger cars.</PARA>
<PARA> Following evidence of an increase in the use of these vehicles as a means of family transport, Ministers of the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) requested a review of the design rules applicable to them. Subsequently, in February 1984, ATAC endorsed a package of safety measures aimed at bringing the present level of safety provided by these vehicles up to the same general level provided by passenger cars. This package introduced a new category of forward-control passenger vehicles and, over the next few years, an increasing number of passenger car ADRs will be applied to this category. However the differences in design between vans and passenger cars is such that not all passenger car rules will be directly applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that work is under way to develop new standards for these vehicles in the areas of braking and frontal impact protection. A test program is currently being carried out by the Office of Road Safety to determine which standards for frontal impact protection will be most effective in improving occupant safety.</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of Road Safety has advised that until the results of its test program have been analysed, it will not be in a position to determine whether passenger car barrier crash test requirements are the most effective means of preventing injuries in forward control vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> The Toyota Tarago, and all other passenger vans, meet the safety standards applying at the time they were manufactured. The press statement `Tarago now safer' is a reference to the manufacturer's claim that the frontal impact performance of the Tarago passes a passenger car barrier crash test, which is in excess of the requirement for vans. I understand that this information is correct.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4256" SPEAKER="Hayden The Hon W.G." NAMEID="RK4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CURTIN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1975 the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation adopted the so-called `Lima Declaration'. In that Declaration the Conference outlined new programs of work for the organisation and expressed the view that to achieve its new goals the scope and functions of UNIDO needed to be extended and its organisational machinery strengthened. Hence the Conference recommended to the United Nations General Assembly that UNIDO should be converted into a specialised agency. Australia participated in the Lima Conference and supported the `Lima Declaration', albeit with a number of reservations.</PARA>
<PARA> A major benefit of the conversion to specialised agency status is that UNIDO's new constitutional arrangements will allow closer direct supervision and scrutiny of the Organisation's activities by member countries. Such closer scrutiny will include UNIDO's budget and programs, both of particular interest to Australia. The new arrangements are expected to improve the efficiency of UNIDO's program delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since its creation in 1967, UNIDO's regular budget has been funded by the United Nations. Accordingly, Australia has not contributed directly to UNIDO's regular budget but has, instead, contributed indirectly through contributions to the United Nations. During this period the Australian contribution to the UN has varied considerably but has tended to be between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of the UN's regular budget.</PARA>
<PARA> When, on 1 January 1986, UNIDO ceases to exist as an organ of the UN General Assembly it will no longer be funded by the United Nations. UNIDO's regular budget for the biennium 1986-87 is expected to be about US$94m and Australia's assessed share of this is presently expected to be 1.66 per cent, i.e. about US$780,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Apart from regular budgetary support, Australia has contributed to the United Nations Industrial Development Fund (UNIDF) since its establishment in 1981. Our contributions to the UNIDF have been:</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-82... $350,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1982-83... $385,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84... $150,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1984-85... $200,000</PARA>
<PARA> 1985-86... $200,000</PARA>
<PARA> By virtue of this contribution, Australia has been involved in a wide range of UNIDF projects since 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> seven workshops have been held: cement and concrete products; building materials; waste heat recovery; timber engineering; solar desalination; selective solar absorbing surfaces technology; and energy management. These workshops have been attended by over 130 overseas participants from some 40 countries, mainly from the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA> other UNIDF projects have included the establishment of a mini-hydro plant in the Solomons; the development of a compost management plant in China; the preparation of a manual on rice husk ash cement; and research into the blending of alcohols with diesel fuel.</PARA>
<PARA> The selection of all projects funded by Australia's contributions to the UNIDF has been subject to Australian approval.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Australia is not, at present, a member of UNIDO's Program and Budget Committee. Australia is, however, a member of the Industrial Development Board and participates in UNIDO's General Conference. Through these and other UNIDO forums Australia is able to express its views on all issues affecting UNIDO, including budgetary questions.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Under the Constitution of UNIDO as a specialised agency, member countries are able more carefully to scrutinise UNIDO's programs and budgets and to determine its activities and priorities. Accordingly, it is expected that Australia will have a greater influence over UNIDO's budget than has been the case in the past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The executive development scheme is a management development program of 12 months' duration conducted by the Public Service Board for senior clerical administrative and professional staff in the Australian Public Service. The executive development scheme provides an integrated program of coursework and work placement experience. While the majority of work placements are arranged within the APS, some EDS participants undertake placements in the private sector or in state or local government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The salaries and placement costs of an executive development scheme participant are met by that participant's home department.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. Ms Butler, a Government architect, is a participant in the 1985 intake of the executive development scheme and is currently on a work placement as a personal assistant to Ms Ita Buttrose.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Under the executive development scheme, participants are sometimes placed as personal assistants to senior public and private sector executives. Such placements have proved valuable in providing them with insights into senior management styles and the issues confronting executives in organisations different from those with which they are familiar. Ms Buttrose was approached by an officer of the Public Service Board in her capacity as a leading executive in the communications industry and asked to accept and supervise Ms Butler as her personal assistant during a work placement. This request was independent of Ms Buttrose's involvement with any particular company. At the time the placement was negotiated, Ms Buttrose was not in fact with radio station 2KY.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Ms Butler's public service classification is Project Manager Class 2. The salary range for this designation is $35,759-$38,009.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) The ranking of 2KY is not immediately available, and is not relevant in view of (1), (3) and (4) above; (b) Yes. 2KY is owned by the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) Ms Butler's work placement with Ms Buttrose under the executive development scheme is not intended to develop her existing architectural skills but rather her management capabilities, as discussed in (b) below; (b) The aim of the executive development scheme is to equip potential senior public servants with the knowledge, experience and skills necessary to help them meet the challenges of senior management in the Australian Public Service. Ms Butler's placement is providing her with a greater understanding of the role of the media, experience in dealing with issues of direct community concern, exposure to executive decision-making in the private sector and research experience in assisting Ms Buttrose in her work with the AIDS Advisory Committee. These experiences are expected to enhance her future performance as a public servant.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr Barry Jones</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) (i) The Government currently has no plans to decommission the HIFAR reactor at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) Research Establishment at Lucas Heights. HIFAR has operated with an excellent safety record since it was commissioned in the late 1950s and is currently undergoing a program of refurbishment to ensure its continued safe operation into the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) In recognition of the fact that in the longer term there will be a limit to HIFAR's operational life, the AAEC has been examining options for the eventual replacement of HIFAR. However, the Government has made no decision on the possible replacement of HIFAR or the location of any replacement reactor.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The possible establishment of a cyclotron to produce medical radioisotopes for use in Australia has been the subject of several studies over the last two decades. In September 1984, the Minister for Health established a Medical Cyclotron Committee to examine the need for a national medical cyclotron facility. This Committee recently presented its report, and the Government will now consider the issue further. Both the Medical Cyclotron Committee and the National Health and Medical Research Council have recommended that the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney would be the appropriate location for a national cyclotron facility in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that in general cyclotrons produce neutron-deficient radioisotopes which complement the neutron-rich radioisotopes produced in nuclear reactors. If a cyclotron were to be established in Australia, it would ensure the availability of short-lived cyclotron-produced radioisotopes which cannot be imported. It would not make the HIFAR reactor redundant as both a cyclotron and reactor would be required to ensure availability of the complete range of radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine.</PARA>

<PARA> The Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment is based in Canberra and, with the exception of the Australian Archives which has a network of State offices, has only two small specialised offices in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department does not routinely make special arrangements for telephone access for the public. On a number of occasions where special provisions have been considered necessary the Department has provided toll free (008) telephone access for specific services: for example, a service is currently available for people wishing to make enquiries on procedures for nominating chemical substances for the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances being compiled by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> While toll free telephone access in cases of this sort is appropriate and cost effective, I consider that provision of such a service by my Department for general enquiry purposes would not be warranted.</PARA>

<PARA> Yes. The United Nations Association of Australia wrote to me on 30 August 1985 seeking support for its proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For Federal funding purposes roads are classified as National, arterial or local under both the Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program and the Australian Land Transport Program (ALTP).</PARA>
<PARA> The principal controls exercised by the Federal Government over each road category under both programs are-</PARA>
<PARA> National (comprising National Highways and Developmental Roads)</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has accepted full responsibility for funding approved works on national roads. The Minister for Transport determines the priority for carrying out works after consultation with the State. The Minister for Transport has power to transfer funds, where a State proposes, from the arterial (and also under ALTP from the local) category to national roads and/or road safety and land transport research.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport may request particulars of projects or programs that he considers should be submitted in accordance with the request.</PARA>
<PARA> Arterial (Rural and Urban)</PARA>
<PARA> Each State Government determines its priorities of individual projects for both programs. These priorities are then submitted to the Minister for Transport for approval. Projects are assessed against the Federal Government's objectives for arterial roads. Under ABRD States are also able to propose a transfer of funds between rural and urban arterial categories.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport may request particulars of projects or programs that he considers should be submitted in accordance with the request.</PARA>
<PARA> Local</PARA>
<PARA> State Ministers are required to submit principles for the distribution of local roads funds between local government bodies and government authorities. The Minister for Transport may approve those principles, vary those principles or determine principles where the State Minister has not proposed principles.</PARA>
<PARA> In practice the Minister for Transport looks to State Ministers to establish those principles in consultation with its local government association. Under ABRD local government nominates projects which the State Government may submit for the approval of the Minister for Transport.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. I would say, however, that I am fully aware of the very important role played, on the one hand, by reconnaissance satellites in strengthening the stability of the global military balance and in the verification of arms control agreements and, on the other hand, by a generally distinct group of satellites, in performing civil functions of the kind mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government considers greater transparency with regard to military activities to be very important to the prospects for arms control over the longer term both for its general confidence building effects and, more particularly, to allow assured and effective verification of compliance with progressively more ambitious arms control and disarmament agreements. For these reasons, the Government attaches particular importance to protecting satellites (and their ground stations) from attack and to the principle enshrined in the SALT I accords (and elsewhere) of non-interference with national technical means of verification which is the contemporary equivalent of the `open skies' proposal. Similarly, the Government supports the concept of an international satellite monitoring agency (ISMA) as a desirable, longer term arms control measure, particularly as one component of a more comprehensive international arms control verification regime that would command the confidence of the major powers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this concept will have to be further developed in a number of important ways before the Government would be in a position to consider whether any of the Australia-United States joint defence facilities could have a role in the concept.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) the recent fourth meeting of the Commission established by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), held in Hobart in September, continued progress towards conserving the living resources of the Antarctic. Last year's meeting had prohibited fishing in waters adjacent to the island of South Georgia for other than scientific purposes. This year's meeting adopted a further binding conservation measure prohibiting any directed fishing for the depleted species of Antarctic Cod (Notothenia Rossii) in the South Georgia area. Members of the Commission were also requested to limit the by-catch or incidential catch of Antarctic Cod in fishing operations directed at other species in the South Georgia area to 300 tonnes, and to refrain from directed fishing for Antarctic Cod in the Antarcric Peninsula, South Orkneys and Kerguelen areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia played a leading role at the meeting proposing total closure of the fishing around South Georgia, and in areas adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkeys, pending detailed analysis of the state of the fishing stocks in these areas. Australia also proposed a species closure for Antartic Cod in the Kerguelen and Heard Island areas. These closures were resisted by a number of major fishing nations operating in the area. These countries took the view that closure of fisheries should only occur once data establishing the threat to fish stocks was clearly available. Ways of obtaining accurate data are still being developed by the Commission. Australia has taken the view that, in the absence of data, the fisheries should be closed so as to minimise the threat to depleted fish stocks.</PARA>
<PARA> The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources clearly establishes the need for a conservationist approach to the marine living resources of the Antarctic. That approach is based on an a unique conservation principle of protection for the entire ecosystem and not just a single species.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's policy in CCAMLR has been concerned to ensure that conservation measures adopted by the Commission reflect the ecosystem approach. To this end Australia has formally placed on the agenda for next year's meeting (Hobart, September) a major item structured towards defining a conservation and management strategy for Antarctic marine living resources. We consider this kind of discussion essential to guarantee an effective CCAMLR regime.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ambassador and counsellors in Australia's Permanent Delegation to UNESCO have taken an active part in the proceedings of the Information Group, comprising the OECD members in UNESCO. Throughout 1984 and 1985 the group has discussed reform proposals for UNESCO, usually at weekly meetings. The meetings are held in private and it is not customary for governments to state publicly what their representatives have said in such meetings.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's Permanent Delegation also dicusses UNESCO's budget, administration, and the cost-effectiveness of UNESCO programs in the Geneva Group, comprising the OECD members which contribute more than one per cent of the budget. In April 1984 Australia was chosen as a member of a sub-committee of the Geneva Group which set out to avoid the disputes and divisions described in the budget section of the report of the Australian Delegation to the General Conference in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the UNESCO conference unanimously endorsed Executive Board decisions in favour of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) zero real growth in the budget for 1986-87,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) no increase in member states' contributions as a result of the withdrawal of the United States, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) greater clarity in presentation of the budget,</PARA>
<PARA>all of which have been major preoccupations of the Geneva Group and member states which have criticised UNESCO.</PARA>
<PARA> In a public address to the General Council of the United Nations Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in London on 13 April 1985, Ambassador Whitlam made suggestions, in the context of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations, to rejuvenate the four largest specialised agencies-ILO, UNESCO, WHO and FAO. He noted specifically reducing the size of their executive bodies, limiting the tenure of their directors-general, revising their financial regulations and holding their conferences at their established headquarters. The address has had a wide circulation and was available to members of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the Australian Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons in preparing their reports on UNESCO. The Department of Foreign Affairs is actively pursuing Ambassador Whitlam's proposals on the tenure of directors-general and the location of the conferences of the specialised agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> During consultation in Canberra in January 1985 Ambassador Whitlam urged the Department of Finance to increase the efficiency of the specialised agencies and to set an example to other major contributors by paying Australia's assessed contributions promptly and in full at the beginning of the calendar year for which they are due. The budget in August 1985 implemented this suggestion. Further detail was provided in the answer of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to Question No. 2138.</PARA>
<PARA> In his speech in the general policy debate at the General Conference of UNESCO in Sofia in October, the Ambassador commended the regulations of ITU, which charges interest on late contributions. As a result the conference augmented its stock appeal for prompt payment by requesting the Director-General `to study the feasibility of providing positive incentives to member states to pay their contributions promptly as well as possible measures to achieve such a policy objective, including where appropriate amendments to the financial regulations'.</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1985 Ambassador Whitlam persuaded the Executive Board of UNESCO to recommend to the General Conference that the number of board seats for Group I (Western Europe and North America) should be reduced from ten to nine and the number of board seats for Group IV (Asia and the Pacific) should be increased from eight to nine. The conference adopted the recommendation in October. The equalisation of seats will take effect at the General Conference in 1987, when Australia and New Zealand will be transferred from Group I to Group IV.</PARA>
<PARA> Ambassador Whitlam has been particularly active in mobilising support among the representatives of Commonwealth countries in Paris and London for the rejuvenation and universality of UNESCO. The Canadian Minister for External Affairs asked him to undertake a speaking tour in the first week of September 1985 and estimates that he reached two million readers and listeners.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia was elected to the Executive Board of UNESCO in the person of Ambassador Whitlam at Sofia. At the first meeting of the reconstituted Board the Ambassador was elected as a member of an 18-member special committee established to pursue reforms in UNESCO. Australia and Mr Whitlam will therefore remain closely involved in the reform process underway in UNESCO.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The AAT Board has no formal proposal from the United Kingdom Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) on this matter. The Board did, however, discuss the decision of the SERC to reduce the funds allocated to all southern hemisphere astronomy activities by more than 50 per cent. The SERC has been forced into this position by overall budget constraints.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Board operates the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Mountain under the authority of the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement, 1969. The Governments of Australia and the United Kingdom equally share the telescope's operational expenses and astronomers from the two countries share the telescope's observing time. Neither of the contracting parties to the inter-governmental agreement, which remains in force until at least 1996, can unilaterally withdraw from it.</PARA>
<PARA> The United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope is a separate British facility on Siding Spring Mountain operated by the Royal Observatory Edinburgh on behalf of the SERC.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The SERC can make recommendations and proposals to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who has not yet taken a position on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If the United Kingdom Government were to reduce its funding to the Anglo-Australian Telescope, the Australian astronomy program would be adversely affected. If funds were reduced to a level where the telescope could not operate effectively, Australian astronomers would lose access to one of the best 4-metre class telescopes in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Board wrote to the SERC Chairman on 27 September 1985 and expressed its concern at the SERC decision. It drew his attention to the fact that the Board is collectively responsible to two Governments and that the AAT Agreement requires the costs of operating the telescope to be agreed by the Board and shared equally by Australia and the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board does not advocate a reduction of the telescope's current level of funding and has advised the SERC accordingly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government supports the concept of an International Satellite Monitoring Agency (ISMA) which was first proposed by France in 1978 at the first special session on disarmament of the General Assembly. The Government considers the concept of an ISMA a desirable arms control measure in terms of its potential confidence-building, verification and transparency objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the concept, Australia voted in favour of the resolution at the 1978 United Nations General Assembly which requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to obtain the views of Member States on the question and appoint a group of qualified governmental experts to study the technical, legal and financial implications of establishing such an agency.</PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to the resolution the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session a report containing the conclusions of the group of experts. A subsequent resolution was adopted which requested the Secretary-General to carry out an in-depth study on the subject and to submit thereon a comprehensive report in time for the 1982 General Assembly. Australia supported this resolution also.</PARA>
<PARA> At the 1982 Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Australia voted in favour of a resolution tabled by France which took note of the Secretary-General's report and study on the technical, legal and financial implications of establishing an international satellite monitoring agency, sought the publication of the study as a United Nations document and requested the Secretary-General to report to the 1983 United Nations General Assembly session on the practical modalities for implementing the conclusions of the report.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the Secretary-General tabled in the General Assembly this third report on the proposal of an ISMA.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no further movement within the United Nations towards the establishment of an ISMA and the subject was not on the Agenda for this year's General Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> As it is doubtful that an effective ISMA could be established in the near future, some caution is required at this stage in the terms and level of Australian support. It is clear that there is considerable room for more work to be done in refining the scope of the proposals, reviewing the feasibility and potential contribution of the proposed technical and organisational systems, assessing the likely requirements including manpower and equipment costs that would be involved in establishing a comprehensive international verification system, incorporating a satellite monitoring capability and addressing the political issues which are raised.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia considers effective verification to be crucial to the monitoring of arms control agreements and implementation of disarmament measures. The Government will continue to follow closely and aim to support the developments of an ISMA which could lead to the establishment of a reliable and effective satellite monitoring system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The IAEA safeguards system and inspection schedules, including frequency of inspection, have been carefully developed, taking into account the nature, number and operating patterns of nuclear facilities in a particular country and the nature and quantities of material covered under each safeguards agreement and facility attachment, so as to enable timely detection of any diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material covered under the agreements. So-called bulk handling facilities, such as enrichment and reprocessing plants, require a greater inspection effort, as much of the nuclear material is normally moved and processed in the form of liquids, gases, powders or in large numbers of identical items such as pellets. These items require a continuous inspection effort. The IAEA does not necessarily consider however that continuous stationing of inspectors at all facilities is necessary to achieve its inspection goals and the objective of timely detection of diversion.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the number of facilities in Canada and Japan, the IAEA has established field inspection offices in those countries to assist in attaining inspection goals. The proximity of the numerous European facilities to the IAEA headquarters in Vienna does not necessitate similar arrangements in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At the Third NPT Review Conference, the Australian Delegation pressed for the intensification of IAEA safeguards coverage in both non-nuclear weapon States and in nuclear weapon States. It also drew attention to the need for safeguarding techniques to be updated to take account of technological developments, and for the Agency to meet its safeguards responsibilities. At the Review Conference, and within the IAEA, Australia has argued for the IAEA to be provided with the necessary financial, manpower and technical resources to meet these responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Third NPT Review Conference urged all non-nuclear-weapon States not party to the Treaty to make an international legally-binding commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and to accept IAEA safeguards on all their peaceful nuclear activities, both current and future, to verify that commitment. The Conference further urged all States in their international nuclear cooperation and in their nuclear export policies and, specifically as a necessary basis for the transfer of relevant nuclear supplies to non-nuclear-weapon States, to take effective steps towards achieving such a commitment to non-proliferation and acceptance of such safeguards by those States. The Conference also expressed the view that accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty is the best way to achieve that objective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government attaches major importance to the prevention of an arms race in outer space and has consistently advocated both in multilateral forums such as the Conference on Disarmament (CD) and bilaterally with the United Sates and the Soviet Union the negotiation of an appropriate agreement or agreements to this end. For example, in August 1984 the Minister for Foreign Affairs proposed to the (CD) that it look into the possibility of protecting from attack all satelites and associated ground stations that contribute to strategic stability. In this context, the Government welcomed the fact that the prevention of an arms race in outer space was one of the objectives agreed to by Messrs Shultz and Gromyko in January 1985 for the bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on space and nuclear arms. Moreover, President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev reaffirmed this objective at their recent summit in Geneva. The Honourable member will also be aware that the Government has stated that it does not endorse the American Strategic Defence Initiative or the counterpart research program in the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> While progress in negotiations on measures to prevent an arms race in outer space has been disappointingly slow it is important that this is now a clearly stated objective in both bilateral and multilateral forums. The Government will continue to urge the superpowers to take concrete steps to prevent an arms race in space and to make the most effective contribution it can to complementary efforts in the CD.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, for the Honourable Member's information, I would point out that the testing and deployment of space-based ballistic missile defences is already prohibited under Article V.I. of the ABM Treaty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government supports the case by case approach adopted by the International Monetary Fund to the problems of all indebted developing nations, including those in Latin America.</PARA>
<PARA> We are sensitive to the problems of those developing countries which are going through the necessary process of economic adjustment while in many cases also attempting to rebuild democratic institutions, sometimes after long periods of authoritarian rule. I have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the need for care in the exercise of conditionality to ensure that economic recovery and political stability are not jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerns of this type are broadly shared in the international community and the International Monetary Fund, through its case by case approach, is able to take these sensitivities into acount. We will maintain an active interest in developments in the indebted developing countries, including those in Latin America.</PARA>
