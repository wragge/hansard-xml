In the event of permission being granted to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to appear by counsel, I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the' Government will enable other parties, who may not be in a position to find the funds to be represented at the meetings of the Commission, to be so represented. I desire to say, in explanation, that I understand there are five interests to be considered by the Commission - the planters, the workers, the millers, the refiners, and the general public or consumers. </para>

                                <para>- I understood that the honorable member a few minutes ago was making certain remarks the effect of which was to make it appear -I may have been wrong - that the Royal Commission referred to had been appointed in a way that was not creditable to the Government or to any one else connected with it. It was under those circumstances that I called the honorable member to order. If he chooses to give notice of a question to me such as he has indicated, I shall be pleased to look into the matter and to give an answer at a later stage. At the present time I am not in a position to give a direct answer. It appeared to me, however, that a Royal Commission, situated as is the Commission to which reference has been made, stands in very much the same position as if it were a court of law dealing with a case. I trust that honorable members will not say anything derogatory to any Commission appointed by this House - or rather by the Government - except by way of a specific motion. </para>

I ask the question merely for the sake of elucidation. Your statement was that a Royal Commission stands in the same position as a judicial authority. I should like to ask you whether that consideration would not be affected by the nature of the Royal Commission's commission?. I do not know of anything which enables us to say that this Royal Commission can be regarded as an entirely judicial body. Would it not then be competent for an honorable member, without submitting a special motion, and so taking up the time of the House, to point out, and prove from the nature of the Commission of Inquiry, that it is by no means a Commission of an impartial character? </para>

                    <para>In regard to a question asked by the honorable member for Herbert relative to the method of entry to the Royal Military College of Australia, I desire to point out that the paragraph on the subject he quoted from the report on the first entrance examination is a quotation from Lord Kitchener's memorandum on the Defence of Australia, and it does not indicate the method which has been adopted by the Department. </para>
                    <para>If the honorable member will read the paragraph immediately following that which he quoted he will see that it was decided to abandon the method proposed by Lord Kitchener, and to adopt the principle of a competitive examination, open without restriction to all candidates within the prescribed ages. </para>

In forty-eight cases the Department has objected to the importation of foods con-' taining ingredients deleterious to infants unless such foods have been marked in a prominent manner as " not suitable for children " under a specified age which is regulated by the class or properties of the food. In the case of many infants' foods formerly reported with advertisements containing misleading and extravagant claims, such advertisements have been prohibited admission. In numerous cases infants' powders, soothing syrups, &amp;c, have been found to contain drugs, more or less injurious, although advertised as containing " nothing injurious to a tender babe," &amp;c. Where preparations containing injurious drugs, or where statements are false, importation has been prohibited. In cases, however, where the contained drugs are not injurious, unless taken in excess, prohibition has not been enforced, but manufacturers have been compelled to revise the advertisements and mark prominently the percentage of deleterious drugs contained, or to exclude such drugs from their preparations. </para>

                        <para>.- May I, by way of introduction, pay deference to the utterances of the honorable member for Darling Downs and the honorable member for Flinders? We cannot but appreciate the lucidity, the" logic, and the keen and careful attention which these honorable members do, from time to time, give to various propositions which are submitted to the House. I pay my deference to them for the very lucid explanation which they gave from their standpoint of this measure, though at the same time I feel myself in opposition to the main points of their contention. I have no legal knowledge, and therefore I speak subject to the professional opinions of legal members on the Opposition side and of the Attorney -General , and such other legal gentlemen as we have on this side. There was one question put by the honorable member for Flinders, and the honorable member for Darling Downs, which appeals to me in a. most pronounced way, and I confess that I cannot see my way out of the difficulty, and that is in con-' nexion with the additional powers, which are sought for the Arbitration Court. It is sought by amendment to provide that no award or order of the Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, called in question, or be subject to prohibition or mandamus in any Court on any account whatever. The power to review, quash, and so forth, such orders is undoubtedly given by section 73 of the Constitution. While a High </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Court is established as an appellate Court its powers are limited, and cannot be exercised in the way of reviewing or quashing any decision in connexion with arbitration. On the other hand, section 75 of the Constitution, which, I understand, deals with the original jurisdiction of the High Court, provides tha' the power of prohibition, mandamus, or injunction does lie in the Court ; and I fail to see how by the mere addition of the words proposed we can go beyond the limitation expressed in the Constitution itself. If it can be shown that this may be done, I shall be very pleased ; and, therefore, though much against my own judgment, I take it that the Attorney-General, in conjunction with the draftsman, can see a way which is not apparent to me as a layman. Nevertheless, I view the .situation with much alarm, and shall be agreeably surprised if they get over the difficulty. Further, I fail, to see how the honorable member for Darling Downs, the honorable member for Flinders, and many others, can vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Ballarat, which is distinctly at variance with the contentions of those gentlemen. The amendment of the honorable member for Ballarat declares that no amendment of the Act, the effect of which would be to concentrate in any one person the control of all the conditions of carrying on all the industries on the continent can be other than impracticable and fraught with danger to the whole community. The contention of these honorable gentlemen is that the power sought does not, and cannot, exist constitutionally, and, therefore, cannot be exercised by Parliament. If that be true, then the honorable members I have named cannot vote for the amendment. It has been said, however, that there is a possibility that such power may lie in the administration - that the interpretation placed on the clause by the Opposition may not be correct - and that it is possible by the means proposed to attain what we desire. It is further contended that to place this power in the hands of the Judge of the Arbitration Court is wrong. We are asked what will be the result if we invest the Judge with this enormous power ; and there is no doubt that honorable members opposite have made much of this point. It is contended that the Judge of the Arbitration Court is subsidiary to the High Court, -or should be, and that, if he be invested, with these powers, he .will be no longer subsidiary-; and the High Court, having no longer any control over him, he will become a Judge supreme in himself, with a power and authority not only judicial, but legislative - that, by his interpretation of the Act, he will decide for himself what the legislation shall be. I admit that there is a great deal of force in the contention; and it is for that very reason I am going to oppose the amendment of the honorable member for Ballarat. I absolutely fail to see how, under any aspect of Federation, it is possible to prevent some legislative power lying with those who have the final determination of the interpretation of the Act.. A day or two ago, when the honorable member for Flinders was speaking, I interjected that in the High Court the final determination was by the judgment of one man; and the only retort from the learned gentleman was that, while we are a democratic community, questions must be decided by majority rule. I fail to see, in connexion with such an issue as that with which we are now dealing, that any greater benefit is to be obtained by leaving the. legislative power in a Federal Court of five Judges, rather than in an Arbitration Court with one Judge. Ever since the Constitution was established, and an appellate High Court has been existent, I have looked with amazement, and sometimes with amusement, at the differences that arise in reference to decisions of the Supreme Courts of the various States. I do not know that the Judges of the High Court are intellectually superior to the Judges of the State Supreme Courts. They may be; but that is a matter no one can determine. We have the fact that, time and again, decisions of Supreme Courts, which, in the absence of a High Court, would have expressed the laws of the States, have been upset, not by unanimous determinations, or the common recognition of what the State law is, but oy a determination in which, in many cases, two Judges were on one side, and three, by chance, on the other. Without disrespect to the High Court, I cannot refrain from commenting on the fact that there is invariably seen, more especially in arbitration matters, Judges like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Connor, or, if not the latter, certainly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs on one side. This seems to me to mark the trend of feeling of those gentlemen - it seems to me not a mere judicial determination, but, - shall I say - law tempered by feelings, emotions,, and tendencies which develop in connexion with their social thought'.  1736 <inline font-style="italic">Conciliation and</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Arbitration Bill.</inline></para>

I believe we are all susceptible to those humane feelings and considerations that make for the benefit of humanity. Nevertheless, this is certainly an aspect of the power of the High Court that has appealed to me in the most pronounced maimer. It has, however, been opposed by many honorable members, who have asserted that the power of interpretation is not the power of legislation. I felt myself on such safe ground that I thought I could not do better than appeal to an authority of some standing ; and I do not think any one will question the status of the writer whom I propose now to quote. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Sidgwick, in the <inline font-style="italic">Elements of Politics</inline> - I am, perhaps, drawing the matter a little, but I do not think unjustly, from its context - writes - </para>

                    <para>The point that I wish to make, and a point which honorable members opposite repudiate, is that this power of one individual, whether it be that of a Judge of the Arbitration Court, whose decisions cannot be quashed or interfered with by the High Court, or that embodied in the High Court, and expressed there finally by a majority decision, is unquestionably, by the terms of interpretation, a power of legislation vested in that Court. That is a power that we do not desire. I fail to see how, in the Federal jurisdiction, we can, get rid of it; but if it is possible to get rid of it, then, I for one, am prepared to do my utmost in this House to do so, or to strive at least to modify it.

                            <para>- I think that the word " supreme " in this relationship merely implies that the Court is the supreme, and therefore the 'highest, Court of the community. It seems to me that the difficulties suggested by honorable members opposite are not tenable. As a matter of fact, whether you place your power in the hands of a Judge who shall exercise it for industrial legislation, or whether you place it in the High Court, finally, it amounts to this : that you vest in the Court a power, not only judicial, but legislative. And the question is whether that legislative power should rest in the hands of the individual who may be termed the Judge in Arbitration, or by a majority decision, in the hands of some individual who may be known as a Justice of the High Court. There is yet another aspect with which I wish to deal, and I am glad that the honorable member for Darling Downs is present. In my opening remarks, I said that I much appreciated the position he took up. The honorable member declared that it was difficult, nay, almost impossible, for a whole body of employers to come together and deal collectively with matters of industrial legislation. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is in regard to this proposed' amendment of the principal Act that the honorable member evidently finds himself"  in some difficulty. Seemingly he cannot understand how employers could by any possibility come together and deal in a collective fashion with men, shall we say, in trade unions or craft unions. It is, therefore, contended by the Opposition that the craft unions and the trade unions must be split up, and that the relationship of the employé must be that of employe1 to employer in what they are pleased to term an " industry " under the old definition - a definition which, whilst satisfactory to the employers, has been most unsatisfactory to trade unionists and craftsmen. But what is the actual position? I received only to-day a typewritten letter, which shows that the employers of the Commonwealth have no difficulty in coming together. Apparently, there is no difficulty of association on their part, since this letter comes from an association phrased as " The Central Council of the Employers of Australia." This is not a council of employers in certain defined industries who, coming together, have segregated themselves from employers in other industries. Not at all. That is not the position as expressed in this letter. It is the Central Council of the Employers of Australia, and their address is given as " Bourke-street, Melbourne." </para>

Do not the employes, as they have done for years, associate themselves on the basis, not of industries, but of crafts? What element of cohesion would there be in any other arrangement? How could you have an association of the employes in a jam factory, where some men are connected with the driving and repairing of machinery, and others engaged in the peeling, cleaning, or boiling of fruit? Members of the Opposition ask for the entire reconstruction of trade unionism. How came we to have industrial legislation? Did it not result from the association of craftsmen, not from the association of employes in particular industries? </para>

                            <para>- He did not, and he stands alone on this side. Industrial legislation is the result of unionism on the craft basis. Engineers must associate with engineers, plumbers with plumbers, carpenters with carpenters, and so on. When an engineer is called upon for his services, he says, " My rate of wages is such and such ; my overtime rate is so much ; my working hours are so long; the conditions of my employment are as specified." He does not vary his demands according to his employment by a draper, a jam maker, or some other person. These living truths are better worth studying than legal subtleties. </para>

                            <para>- I do not find fault with that. Although I would give preference to unionists, the non-unionist has also to be considered in dealing with industrial legislation. But why should we deal with this matter on the lines proposed by the Opposition? We hold that there cannot be collective bargaining except by organizations representing trades and callings. We say that the meaning attached to " industry " in the present law is injurious. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. My organization has been engaged in disputes as wide as the Commonwealth. In England, it includes over  100,000  persons, but it has met every situation that has arisen there for many years past, and done it effectively by trade union methods, without legislation. The efficiency of our methods has been proved, but honorable members opposite wish to adopt something that has not been tested by time, and which, it seems to me, is put forward in the interests of the employing class, and to break up trade unionism by dividing up the members of the different crafts, and distributing them among various industries, so that there can be no cohesion. </para>

I have had experience in arbitration work, because for a number of years I represented my organization. In the main, the New South Wales Act of1901, which recognised the trade union as a basis of industrial association, was more effective in providing for arbitration by a Court than the Industrial Disputes Act of  1908,  which amended it. The definition of " industry " in. the latter Act was this - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Act was amended in  1908,  because the schedule was found to be ineffective, and it is common knowledge that trade unions refused to register under it, because it was felt that the definition of " industry " materially injured them. Ever since there has been strike upon strike, and great loss has been caused to the trade unionists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon, referring to the difficulties created by the schedule, said, "I cannot add to the pack of cards, but I can shuffle it as I please. I can associate one trade or calling with another, and relate it. in some way to an industry." Of what value is it to trade unionism to include under " industry " the Government railway and tramway employes under the control of the Chief Railways Commissioner? How can they all be brought into Court at one time, with a view to determining what should be their rates of pay and conditions of labour? It must be remembered that they comprise permanent-way men, traffic branch men, in both railways and tramways, engineers, carpenters, signalmen, masons, bricklayers, tinsmiths, and many others. But all these varied callings are associated, because they are under an official who, according to the law, controls an " industry." </para>

What would be the result of attempting to refer to a Court or to a Wages Board any dispute affecting all the trades and callings associated with the maintenance and working of railways and tramways. We are every day of our lives in the Courts. There is not a day on which the secretary of a union has not to watch the papers to see what applications are being made to the Court. After the passing of the Act of  1908,  I had, in twelve months, more work to do in going before the Court and raising objections to applications that were being made, than I had during the whole of the previous five or six years. The formation of the Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration and the power to define industry in the terms in which the Opposition desire to define it, have been productive of the most intense and undesirable litigation. </para>

I take it that we are now going to amend the term " industry," so that we may have an amended Conciliation and Arbitration Act, upon the lines which we think will more effectively deal with the situation as we see it. . The honorable member for Cook spoke at length the other night on the lines of what he terms ' ' industrial unionism." I was not present when the speech was made, and if, in my criticism of it, I say anything that does not correspond with the facts of that utterance, I must apologize; but I do not think I shall do the honorable member any injustice. The attitude taken up by the honorable member seems to fit in very exactly with the attitude which the Opposition are taking up on this measure. </para>

The honorable member for Darling Downs said on Friday that the honorable member for Cook expressed the attitude of a worker. True, it is the attitude of a worker, but it is not the attitude of the workers; ind the honorable member for Cook knows that it is opposed by the Sydney Labour Council, has been opposed for two or three years by the Trade Union Congress, and is opposed by my own organization, the engineers, by the traffic association, by the building trades, by the Locomotive Engine Drivers' Association, by the Tramway Union, by the carpenters, and, in fact, by nearly every trade and calling in the railway service. The honorable member's proposition is not recognised in New South Wales, even outside that service. I cannot speak as to the other States; but I can assure honorable members of the Opposition that the attitude which they think most satisfactory on the part of the honorable member for Cook does not, in any way, represent the position of the trade unions or of the craftsmen in my own State. </para>

                            <para>- Even so, the honorable member's attitude by no means represents that of the general workers and the trade unionists of New South Wales. To give an illustration, which may enable honorable members to see the desirability of this amendment of the Arbitration Act - about five years ago I was instrumental in getting an award for the engineering trade under the 1 90 1 Arbitration Act of New South Wales. That award had to last for three years. When the award was about two years old, the Industrial Disputes Act came into operation. The result was that, whereas the employers, from the Railways Commissioners down, had been complying with the award, we suddenly found ourselves face to face, under the new Act, with applications for exemption. The first was by the Railway Commissioners, the next by the Northern Collieries, and we had just spent ,£.250 in prosecuting the colliery-owners for breaches of the award. We are always told how the men break awards by coming out on strike, and will not recognise their duty and their obligations in connexion with legislation ; but I venture to say that, if honorable members opposite were in the Arbitration Courts day after day, and saw the breaches of awards that take place, they would find that, for every body of men that go out on strike, there are 150 employers violating the awards every day of their existence. First, then, we had an application for exemption from the Railways Commissioners, then from the Northern Collieries, and then from the Southern Collieries. Then there was a Coach and Car Builders Board formed. Although we had spent money for some years to get the award, we found all these exemptions suddenly granted under the new Act, and granted under precisely the same terms as members of the Opposition are asking for in this case, with a definition of industry which relates to the employers rather than to the employes. From that day to the present time, New South Wales has simply been seething with disruption and dissatisfaction among the trade unionists, and the Courts have been filled with applications day after day, without any possibility of industrial rest or peace being obtained. It is of no use the Opposition crying for industrial peace on such lines, because they will not get it. They cannot have it. We have built up for ourselves, during a long course of years, a line of action that we  deem essential. We have formed associations that we know to be beneficial to ourselves, and no definition of industry that may emanate from this House will take possession of us, if we find it to be injurious. There is nothing for it but the trade or craft union. The industrial union may have, and I believe will have, its political characteristics ; but, so far as industrial organizations are concerned, only one basis will be satisfactory to us, and that is the craft union. I trust, therefore, that the Opposition will not further oppose the measure. If it be only in a tentative way, if only to give us some opportunity of seeing what results may arise from the operation of an amended Act, I hope they will give us the Act amended in the terms for which we are asking. I think then they will find that if they want industrial peace they will get it; but they will never get industrial peace without it. </para>

                            <para>- No. I shall endeavour to show that the amendments, as proposed in the Bill, will have the effect of destroying the whole basis of arbitration. The amending Act of  1910  had for its main object the settlement of differences before they became active disputes, and also the securing of preference to unionists. The word "industry" remained untouched, except that it was extended to rural industries and domestic servants. The Act as then amended was not given a proper trial before this new amendment was brought before the House, altering the whole basis upon which our scheme of arbitration had formerly been built. These constant amendments in our arbitration laws, before we have any real opportunity of testing their efficiency, or their possibilities for the prevention and settlement of disputes, are calculated to cause irritation in the industrial world, rather than to make for peaceful settlements. </para>

                            <para>- The High Court has defined " industry "in a manner which really upholds instead of destroying the old Act, and preserves, for the future judgments of the Arbitration Court, the true basis of arbitration between employers and employes. We object to these amendments of the Act, because the High Court decision has properly interpreted the word " industry " as we understand it, and as the Legislature originally intended that it should be interpreted. </para>

                            <para>- The High Court decision was a majority decision, as was mentioned by the honorable member for Flinders ; but surely the honorable member for Maribyrnong, who professes to belong to a Democratic party, cannot object to a majority decision, even when it comes from the High Court. The amendment' of last session, including, as it did, rural workers and domestic servants,, was a sufficiently sweeping extension. I believe there was no necessity for the inclusion of those callings as " industries " within the scope of an Arbitration Act. </para>

                            <para>- No; because an industry carried on in large cities like Melbourne and Sydney continues under much more closely approximating conditions than any agricultural industry can possibly do. I know, from the various opinions expressed by the agricultural community throughout my district, representing, as they do, a large proportion of the farmers of Victoria, that the system of arbitration, as amended under the Act of last session, will cause them very grave and serious difficulty. They hardly know how it is possible for them to present their case to the Court ; although certainly the organization of workers in the industry would have no difficulty in presenting their case. If this Bill be passed, we shall find that those difficulties will be accentuated. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any member of this House will arrogate to himself judicial functions by offering definite opinions on this measure. It is the duty of the high Court to interpret the constitutionality of legislation passed by this Parliament. I admit that if* the measure be passed in its present form the cause of unionism in Australia will be strengthened. Unionism in itself is a good thing. If we are to have unionism, we must have organizations of employers and of employed. The more extensive their operations can be made the better. But my complaint is that by passing this Bill we shall throw the whole cause of conciliation and arbitration into the hands of various craft unions, and shall make it extremely difficult for employers and employed in the rural districts to have their cases determined. The difficulty of such persons bringing cases before the Arbitration Court will be accentuated. Thus we shall strengthen the trades organizations existing in the large centres of population. Cases affecting rural interests will be brought before the Court in a partial manner, and reasonable decisions will not be given. </para>

                    <para>I wish to refer to the New Zealand experience. It is constantly being stated in this House that, owing to our constitutional limitations, we are not able to adopt an effective system of arbitration. I believe that there is a direction in which we can improve our system by enabling the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to hear appeals from the various State tribunals. Such a policy would, I think, be indorsed by this House, and if it had been submitted to the people at the last referendum I believe that it would have been sanctioned. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should not only sit to settle Inter-State disputes, but should also hear appeals from State tribunals affecting particular industries. That is the true line of advance for the Federal Legislature. The New Zealand experience, I may remind honorable members, has extended over twice the length of time that arbitration has been in operation in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">New Zealand has had twenty years' of conciliation and arbitration as compared with about seven years' experience under the Commonwealth. Moreover, the New Zealand Court is not hampered in any sense by . constitutional limitations. The Court has full power to arbitrate in whatever sense it may deem arbitration advisable. But the New Zealand Legislature, realizing the multitudinous industries operating in the' Dominion, and knowing how difficult it was for rural representatives to present their claims, divided the Dominion into districts. Separate awards are made in those districts in the same way as awards are made by the various State tribunals throughout Australia. But sometimes, after a district award has been made, the Board, having finished its local work, undertakes the functions of a Court of Appeal. That is to say, on the application of unions of either employers or employes the Court considers what may be called an appeal from particular district decisions. There we have an example that might be followed in Australia. It would be very useful if the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could hear appeals from State tribunals. We have all the machinery that is operating under the Arbitration laws of New Zealand. By adopting this plan, it would not be necessary for the Commonwealth to interfere seriously with the work of the Wages Boards that are being conducted so successfully in different parts of Australia. What is now proposed, however, would, in my opinion, exercise an unwarrantable interference with State tribunals, which could only end in confusion, and. destroy a large part of the benefits which are at present conferred upon those concerned in production in this country. If we are to substitute for industries, as the term is understood under the principal Act, a system of craft organization extending over the whole of Australia, we shall accentuate difficulties that have already made themselves apparent. We shall strike a serious blow at production, and shall, at the same time, destroy the basis upon which the whole scheme of arbitration has been built up. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Hindmarsh is well aware of the importance of our great water ways in the arid centres of this continent. Rural cultivators in those parts of the country are engaged in a great variety of industries. We have fruit-growing, dairying, agricultural work of all kinds, wheat growing, and wool growing. The occupations are so varied that dozens of workmen are employed for different classes of work. In connexion with the pumping schemes along the rivers, for instance, there are engine-drivers who have some knowledge of engineering, and who drive engines for a portion of their time, whilst the rest of their occupation is directed to some other class of labour. If this Bill be passed, and we carry out a system of craft organization instead of the present system  of  industrial organization, we shall undoubtedly strike a serious blow at our great producing industries, which, after all, form the backbone of this country, and without which there can be no strong secondary industries. I know from' experience, in connexion with the application of rural workers for registration, the difficulties that farmers have to encounter at present. I venture to say that the great majority of farmers throughout Australia are quite prepared  to  pay fair and reasonable wages. They are equally prepared to abide by the decisions of equitable tribunals as to the wages they shall pay. The farmers and the dairymen have greater confidence, I venture to say, in the Wages Board system  as  it operates in the States, because they believe that the Boards are composed. in a way which will bring about better results than would the Arbitration Court. The Wages Board system is less costly than the other. The parties have not to go to a Court for a judicial decision, but to men who understand the operations  on  each side, and meet together for the purpose of discussing, in a practical and human way, their differences, in order that they may arrive at a reasonable settlement. When this power was placed in the Constitution Bill by the Federal Convention, it was never anticipated that the work of the Arbitration Court would be directed to every small organization of industry throughout the Commonwealth. It was only intended that the great industries which operate more or less over the continent should be  Supervised  by the Arbitration Court, in order that disputes might be settled by that body  in  a way which could not possibly be undertaken by the State tribunals. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. At the present time, we are not giving an opportunity to the States to develop their various tribunals. Victoria has over  100  Wages Boards ; but the State Legislatures have found, from experience, that  it  is impossible to appoint Boards whose decisions will operate with fairness and equity over even a very small! . territory compared with this great Commonwealth. Even the States have found that Wages Boards operating over the whole of a State cannot do justice to particular industries by reason of varying climatic and: other conditions. They have been compelled, in, some instances, to appoint, not only town Boards, but also country Boards, in order that decisions may be framed in a way that will suit the local conditions and be arrived at by men who understand each other, and have a practical knowledge of the difficulties of an industry. I hope that the House will pause before it places in the hands of one individual the power to control the industrial laws of the Commonwealth. I believe that this measure, if passed, will be fraught with the greatest confusion and the greatest difficulty, and be found to affect very prejudicially industries .throughout, the Commonwealth. It is against the spirit of the Constitution, because it is destructive of that local control, that subdivision of effort, which we know is so valuable in the settlement of industrial disputes. I am sorry to say that there does not seem to be much prospect of carrying the amendment; but I trust that the Opposition will make a strong protest against this attempt to destroy the basis of arbitration, and to place in the hands of one man the control of the industrial affairs of the Commonwealth - a power which will seriously militate against the successful operation of our Wages Boards, and will generally, in my opinion, strike a very heavy blow at the production of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>-- I feel that this measure deals with the most important subject which can be brought before this Parliament; and though honorable members opposite have agreed that the Arbitration Court has proved a failure, and been a clog on the industries of the country, and is unwieldy and unworkable, I would, point out that the success of that Court means , more than the success of any other Court, because it operates under a new piece of legislation. Other Courts, such as the Equity, Divorce, Bankruptcy, and Criminal Courts, are institutions which have been handed down for perhaps hundreds of years; and laws relating to those Courts have been amended year after year until they have reached perfection. We are only experimenting with the Arbitration Court ; but because it has proved a failure in certain respects,  "that is no reason why honorable members opposite should condemn the principle of arbitration, or the decisions of one man. I remember reading the speech with which the Leader of the Opposition introduced the principal Act, and I was struck with the sense of responsibility under which he addressed the House, and I hoped that he would live to see the successful working of the measure. I feel sure that he, like other honorable members, -will not hesitate to give a vote to perfect any measure which will tend to bring about industrial peace, and promote the happiness of the people pf the Commonwealth. The present Government were placed in power by the electors to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act where possible, with a view to bring about .that condition of peace and harmony which we all wish to see prevailing. We may have failed under the existing Acts to achieve our purpose, but we are only human. This Parliament has teen charged by the Judges with not having given any lines of guidance to the Court to go upon. They have said, " You have thrown at us an Act, and told us to carry out the dictates of Parliament, without laying down any lines on which we are to proceed." I admit the charge. It is a serious handicap on a Judge sitting in the Arbitration Court. But I hope that the day is not far distant when the House will give directions to the Judge in many respects. I believe that the time has come when the House should pass a Bill providing that no more than eight hours shall be worked by any man in the Commonwealth. That would be a direction to the Arbitration Court in one respect. The Judges are clamouring for a direction as to hours of labour. They want some guidance from Parliament; and we should not hesitate to provide that the hours of labour should he restricted within certain limits. I also think that a Bill should te passed providing that no person shall be expected to work for wages under a certain standard, that is, laying down a minimum wage. That also would be a guide to the Judge.  His  Honor is quite right in saying that Parliament  throws all responsibility on the Judge, and takes none itself. We are open to that reproach, but I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall give the Judges a lead in various directions. Honorable members on the other side have complained greatly about one-man decisions. Here again I am in accord with some of their criticisms. I believe that the basic principle of the Federal Arbitration Court was wrong. I hold that no one man should dictate the rates of wages, the hours of labour, in fact the whole industrial conditions for the Commonwealth. I consider that the Arbitration Court should be reconstituted, and include a representative of the employers and a representative of the employes. In that way we should strengthen the faith of the people in the Court. At present when a decision is given in the Arbitration Court, the employers say " Although the Judge has the confidence of the people, because he is a. learned lawyer, and has held high positions, still he is not a business man. He has no sympathy in his nature. He is simply a legally-trained man to give a decision on the evidence put before the Court. ' ' The Court is, as I have said, different from all other Courts. It deals with live industries, with humanity ; it does not interpret dead laws, but gives decisions which will affect the whole of the industries in the Commonwealth. The  President  of the Arbitration Court should not be called upon to be guided altogether by his own legal training and knowledge. I believe that in many cases even an employer's representative would give a fair decision when he had a case brought before him as an em:ployer, even though it was to advantage the employes, because he would look at the matter from a business and practical standpoint. He could help the Judge in many directions by the weight of his experience, and guide him in arriving at a judgment. The same thing applies to a representative of the employes. If an award is given by the Judge, the employes are not satisfied to the same extent as they would be if they were represented in the Court. It is necessary to go over the whole of the industrial conditions to explain the conditions of an industry. The Court takes a longer time than otherwise it would to come to a decision, and sometimes, unfortunately, the decisions have not been satisfactory. If we had two laymen to assist the Judge the position would be different. This is not a Court in the strict sense of the word. The persons who go before the Court are not criminals - not men who have broken the law and been brought up to be tried, but men who come and submit to its judgment the conditions on which they are prepared to work in an industry. I agree with the members of the Opposition that no one man should have the power to decide the labour conditions for the whole of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill does not affect that. I believe that the Court would command more respect and confidence if it included representatives of the employers and employes, that is judging by the experience of New Zealand. It was the first country to adopt the principle of arbitration in these matters, and it still adheres to that principle. Its Court is composed of a Judge who is accustomed to discussing points of law, drawing up awards, and giving decisions, and two laymen, representing the employers and the employes. What has been the result of this system? In New Zealand, to-day, the industrial system is proceeding very smoothly. There are fewer strikes there than in any other country in the Southern Hemisphere. The progress of New Zealand has been very satisfactory under the operation of an Arbitration Court. Since the principle has been successful there, I believe that it will be successful here. It has been argued from the other side that if the Arbitration Court is going to deal with the whole of the industrial system, matters must get congested. </para>

                            <para>- No one person could do the work. Under the present Act, the Judge has power to appoint deputies in each State to assist him to carry on the work of the Court. I think it would be justifiable, if necessary, to create a Federal Court to deal with, for instance, the mining, textile, shipping, and coal-mining industries. If that were done, the work of the Arbitration Court would be facilitated and the progress of the Commonwealth assisted. I feel quite sure that honorable members, although they sit in Opposition, would be only too pleased to bring into force a scheme which would secure peace and harmony in the community. I was pleased to follow the honorable and learned member for Flinders when he pointed out the rocks ahead. I believe that he is very near the point. I believe that when we want to get the whole advantages of legislation we sail so closely to the rocks as to involve disaster to the measure. However, we are sent here, as a party, to give, if we can, the best legislation for the industrial class. Great exception has been taken to the word "craft." </para>

                            <para>- No. I said that we were sent here to get the best conditions possible. Since great exception has been taken to the word " craft," let us trace the use of the word, and see how it has worked out. The word "industry" could not cover the whole of the people  or  craft in an industry. Take, for instance, the boot trade. The engine-drivers and firemen  are  employed entirely apart from the place  where  boots are manufactured. Although they are part of the industry, they are not in the industry, but outside of it. They do not touch leather or handle goods. Their whole work is connected with the boilers and the engine, but they are the mainspring of the industry, because they supply the power. Without their co-operation the industry could not exist. ' </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but these men cannot join the Operative Bootmakers Association. When operative bootmakers appeal to their employer for better conditions, or for a conference, the engine-drivers and firemen, being few in number - perhaps three or four - do not count. The employer takes no notice of them, but deals with the large body of men. Consequently, the engine-drivers and firemen have been forced  to  form what is called a craft union. When the Operative Bootmakers Association seeks an award, they do not apply to the Court for any conditions which would benefit the lot of the engine-drivers and firemen. The latter are left completely out of consideration, although they form part of the industry. We cannot separate the craft from the industry - the two work together. </para>

                            <para>- It  must  be done for certain purposes. The engine-drivers and firemen start an hour or  two  before the other men come in, and are at work after the men leave; they live in a different atmosphere compared  With  those employed in  clicking, heeling, lasting-up, and other branches. The manufacture of bread, in most up-to-date factories, is carried on by machinery ; and here, again,  the  men who fire the boilers and drive the engines are entirely outside the bakehouses. Their dirty clothes and greasy hands alone would render them unfit to touch the bread. Although they are an important part of the industrial organization, when _  the  bakers  go  to the Court, the engine-drivers and firemen are never included. The latter are, therefore, forced to join the same union as engine-drivers and firemen employed, for instance, in the boot trade. There is another illustration, in which Inter-State competition arises. In the freezing industry, which deals with beef, mutton, rabbits, and so forth, for export, hundreds of men are employed in the handling and stacking of the food and material; but the engine-drivers and firemen, who look after the machinery that keeps the chambers cool, are really the principal men. If they stopped work, and the temperature was allowed to rise, there would be a loss of thousands of pounds. However, if the storage employes make a demand for increased wages or better conditions, they do not take the engine-drivers or firemen into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- No; it has been decided by the High Court that the Judge of the Arbitration Court cannot add any claim to the case filed. He did so in the Broken Hill case, in regard to Sunday labour; but the High Court held that he had no power to do so. Because the men are not in the union of the industry, but belong to a separate craft union, they would have no claim before the Court. I remember a case in Sydney where the freezers got an award of the Court, and the whole argument against that award, which was one of increased wages, was that there was InterState competition with the shippers in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Queensland; and that, consequently, increased wages to the engine-drivers and firemen would be unjust to the employers in Sydney. To get over the disability these men federated, having got as many Wages Board awards as they could, and still found themselves left out. They got an award from the Federal Arbitration Court, but lost the benefit of it, because the employers' associations in New South Wales and Victoria were separate organizations, and, in order to defeat the Act, they had not registered. On this ground, the Federal Arbitration Court was held to have no jurisdiction, and the engine-drivers were denied justice. Surely it is only fair to so amend the Act as to introduce the word " craft," and thus bring the engine-drivers and firemen within the jurisdiction ? </para>

                    <para class="block">Wages Boards, although, personally, I am against them. The Arbitration Court, with the full powers of a Supreme Court, may send for documents, examine books, and investigate the profits of an industry, and thus be enabled to give an award fair and just to all concerned. With the Judge in the Arbitration Court should be two men paid a decent salary, who would make' it their business to study the conditions of the various industries. These men, after having, as laymen, acted as the representatives of the employes, would not then have to look for work; they would be above that, because, for the time being, their position in the Court would be a professional one, and they should be independent. Under the Wages Board system, however, there is no power to send for documents and books or to investigate as to the capital invested or the profits made. The Board are confined to the evidence laid before them. And how is that evidence obtained ? A union selects one of its members because he is smart, capable, and straightforward ; and, in all probability, he finds himself sitting on the opposite side of the table from his own employer. In the very nature of things, an employe in that position is not a free man, because he knows that, after the work is finished, he must look tor employment. If he puts up a good fight for his fellow men, and obtains a decent award, it has, unfortunately, occurred in some cases, though I hope this is not prevalent, that he has been gradually shunted out of the industry. </para>

                            <para>- There is finality in New South Wales, because the appeal is to Judge Heydon's Court. For the reasons I have given, the workers of New South Wales are not favorably impressed with the Wages Board system. There is another reason why we, on this side, do not raise any serious objection to the decision being left to one man. In New South Wales Judge Heydon settles all the disputes, there being no appeal from the Industrial Disputes Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> amended the Act, so as to make the decision of the Court final ; and I think that Judge Heydon has been very successful, or, at any rate, there have been no protests raised. Under all the circumstances, we may, I think, congratulate the Opposition on their fair criticism. So far this has been a debate by legal members ; and, doubtless, we could all find fault with the measure. It will be to- the interests of this Parliament to concentrate our best efforts upon this work so as to produce a Bill satisfactory to the people of the country. No Court in the civilized world has so much depending on it as an Arbitration Court, which can keep the wheels of industry revolving ; and, as this Bill is an effort to that end, the majority of honorable members ought to support the Government. If we give the engine-drivers and firemen, for instance, no redress, they are in a position to bring about industrial chaos throughout the Commonwealth, seeing that they supply the power to every factory, every gold mine, and every coal mine. If the Federal Arbitration Court does not give them justice, we cannot blame them if they try to obtain it by brute force ; and in the interests of peace and good government I trust the Bill will be passed. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the honorable member is correct. There were no strikes in New South Wales under the old Act until the High Court decisions in the Brown case, and several other cases in the Newcastle district. When the Act was passed, the coal miners of New South Wales were the first to register; and, after occupying the time of the Court for months, they got awards which they  accepted  as satisfactory. The employers, on their part, decided to test the legality of the decisions in certain of the cases. I make the assertion that under the Arbitration Act of New South Wales there were not, so far as I know, any strikes during the first three or four years; at any rate, there were certainly no strikes until the High Court decisions, one of which had reference to the common rule in the Clancy case. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but there was a decision that the union could not lodge a claim on behalf of its members. The men naturally asked what was the good of recognising a Court that would not recognise their union, although the Act was based on the recognition of unions. From that decision came all the disaster ; and, unfortunately, there was a Government in power in New South Wales at the time which was antagonistic to arbitration, and did not amend or renew the Act. This was a temporary measure for six years, and it expired by effluxion of time, the unsympathetic Government making no attempt to improve legislation which we knew was only experimental. The result is that we have had nothing but strikes, locks-out, and general, industrial upheaval. Under the. circumstances, I hope the Commonwealth Parliament will do its best to make the Act acceptable to the people of the country. If the High Court declares the amendments <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and thus completely annihilates the whole principle of arbitration- </para>

                            <para>- In the framing of the principal Act I give the honorable member for Ballarat credit for the best intentions : and we know that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> made strong efforts to procure an effective measure. If he were here to-day, I am sure that he would regret the many failures of the Act as the result of test cases brought before the High Court. Unless we can pass a Bill that will be beneficial and work smoothly we cannot expect either the industrial army of workers or the employers to be content. If we cannot secure arbitration for both sides on reasonable lines we shall have, to return to the old method nf settling disputes. I believe, however, that the position even under the existing law is infinitely better than it was under the old method of determining .industrial differences. Two or- three disputes have been settled even by the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and in that way great industrial upheavals have been averted. For example, the Court, after some years of fighting, has settled the trouble in the boot trade in a way that has given, ' I believe, satisfaction, whilst it has also effected settlements in regard to the pastoral industry and the seamen. In both those cases I believe the decision of the Court has given satisfaction. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Court, while it lasted was very satisfactory. I appreciate the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Angas, the honorable member for Flinders, and others who have dealt with the legal aspects of this measure. I believe that there is a great deal in what they have said. We can, however, only hope for the best. I trust that we shall give this measure a trial, and that when it becomes law, and a case relating to it is brought before the High Court, the Justices will not search section after section to ascertain what was the real intention of its framers, but will take the passing of the Act itself as an instruction that our intention is that crafts shall be recognised as part of an industry. </para>

                    <para class="block">Bill. First of all, the honorable member said it was wrong, and more or less courting disaster, to increase the already overwhelming duties of a one-man Arbitration Court. Then he feared that there were rocks ahead by reason of the constitutional difficulties standing in our way. All these difficulties he fully realized, but he invited us to join with the Government and their supporters in an effort to make the Bill as complete and effective as possible. My honorable friend spoke with a large experience, and the warnings given by him should of themselves be sufficient to induce honorable members to hesitate in their wild rush to pass this Bill. The honorable member for South Sydney realizes to the full the constitutional difficulties in the way, and the Opposition have been persistent in pointing out those difficulties to the Government and their supporters. We have asked them to realize that we are bound within the limits of the Constitution, and that therefore we have to consider the character of the measure that we can pass, having regard to those limitations. The Leader of the Opposition demonstrated the. revolutionary character of the Bill, and he and other honorable members have shown conclusively that the proposed substitution of the craft union for the unit of industry practically means the recasting of the whole of the arbitration laws and amounts to a departure from the fundamental principles of those laws. </para>

                        <para>- It is practically a substitution that is proposed. The honorable member for Flinders ably and forcibly demonstrated that from a constitutional stand-point there are difficulties in the way of applying the craft principle to our present arbitration laws. The essence of the Constitution so far as this matter is concerned is contained in the provision giving us power to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and the Court has already held, as the honorable member for Flinders has pointed out, that " industry " implies the relationship of employer and employed Thus, in this connexion we shall have, on the one hand, a craft union representative of the whole of Australia - for that is the object of this Bill - and, on the other hand, thousands of employers-  without any cohesion and possessing no relatively common interest. Hence, there would not be in the ordinary course of affairs an "industrial dispute" as between the craft union, and the whole of the employers of Australia interested in any particular trade, unless it was artificially brought about, for the purposes of the Act. If there cannot be an " industrial dispute " in that sense there can be no constitutional power to deal with the dispute. </para>

                            <para>- That is, in name, a federation of employers, but, in fact, is representative of only a limited number of the employers of Australia. Thousands of manufacturers and other employers of labour throughout the Commonwealth, have their own individual interests, but there is no common interest  ;is  between the one employer and the other. In these circumstances, therefore, this Bill contemplates a total departure from 'he fundamental principle of the idea of industrial disputes. It is looked upon with some degree of anxiety from this side of the House, because of that fact, and because also we believe that it subverts the Constitution. We believe that it destroys the scheme of the Constitution which gives to the Commonwealth certain arbitration powers in regard to large Inter-State matters, while it reserves full and complete power to the States themselves to deal with their own State industrial affairs. If this Bill is availed of to the fullest extent, by the whole of the crafts of Australia, then the power to deal with industrial matters is thereby transferred to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, what industrial power can remain with the States? If the fullest advantage is taken of this measure, and if there is a craft union in connexion with every trade there will be practically no industrial power left to the States and the various industrial tribunals of the States will be mere obsolete machinery with practically nothing to do. This Bill, in such circumstances, would really subvert the Constitution, and must have the result of defeating the powers that were specifically reserved to the States themselves. It is difficult to see how it will be possible for an industrial dispute to arise as between the whole of the employers of Australia and the whole of the employes cf a particular craft, yet that practically impossible condition of affairs is contemplated by this  Bill.  I am disposed to the view that, even if the Bill is passed, the awards must be confined to, and bind only, those employes who are contestants and parties to the dispute. Even if we assume that such an industrial dispute is technically possible, I am certain that the Bill is doomed to failure by reason of its utterly impracticable character. The Attorney-General stated that one of the objects of the Bill - and he urged this very strongly - was to cause the doors of the Feder.il Conciliation and Arbitration Court to he opened wider and wider so that it would be possible for every trade union to go to the Court at its pleasure. He then went on to argue that as a result there would Le an award of a uniform rate throughout Australia in connexion with those respective trades. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is wrong, because the Attorney-General did not limit it. He was talking of Australian industries in general, and I take him to mean what he says. He said .that a differentiation in the rates paid to men belonging to the same union, but engaged in different industries, was calculated to cause serious discontent, and from that stand-point he urged the payment of a uniform rate. I can quite understand that, from a constitutional standpoint, the Attorney-General would do so. To have uniform rates for the whole of Australia, which is really one of the objects of the Bill, would be outrageously unfair. It would be unjust to fix for engine-drivers, carpenters, plumbers, and others working at Kalgoorlie the same rates as were paid to similar artisans in Victoria or New South Wales, where the cost of living is 30 per cent. less. </para>

Do honorable members consider that there should be discrimination, the Court declaring one rate for Victoria, another for Tasmania, and so on ? </para>

                    <para class="block">It has been found impracticable to impose uniform rates, even for Victoria. Except in a few industries, awards are confined to branches of industries, or to particular localities. In regard to engine-drivers, there have been appointed in Victoria Boards, one relating to gold-mining and coal-mining, and another dealing with all the factories throughout Victoria. It is competent for the last-named Board to determine that an engine-driver in one factory shall be paid a particular rate, and an engine-driver in another factory a particular rate ; but coal-mining engineers and gold-mining engineers are dealt with by a particular Board of their own. In this connexion, a differentiation in the rates takes place, and a higher rate is paid for drivers in charge of winding engines, because they carry human freight. There are two Printers Boards in Victoria, one of which deals with the cities and towns, and the other with the country. We have the same experience with regard to saddlery and saw-milling. The power which the Governor in Council possesses of taking away certain powers given to one Board and transferring them to another, for the purpose of adjustment, has been exercised in two or three cases, such as that of the Carters Board, where quarrymen carters were attached to the Quarryrnen's Board; and pastrycook carters were attached to the Pastrycooks Board. In this State Wages Boards have the power to deal, not only with industries over the whole State, but with the same industries, in detail, in various portions of the State where different conditions exist. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General spoke in high terms of the success of our Arbitration Court. 1 am prepared to say, at once, that any success that has been achieved by the Court has been achieved through the distinguished ability of its  President,  and that the work has been done, as far as he has been able to do it, ably, thoroughly, and conscientiously. The Attorney-General went on to say that "no testimony could be more eloquent as to the value of the Court than that all the unions are trying to get into it." Will my honorable friend think for a moment why this Court has become so remarkably popular? In existing circumstances, we cannot blame the unions for their anxiety to get into it as soon as possible. We cannot ignore the circumstance that the  President  of the Court has seen fit, no doubt in the conscientious discharge of his duty, to make generous awards so far as the workers are concerned, based, of course, on the present highly prosperous condition of Australia. I am not attempting to cavil at what the learned  President  of the Court has done; but the fact remains that, as Artemus Ward once said, there is a great deal of human nature about men ; and consequently, as it has been the universal experience to secure very generous treatment at that Court, there is naturally a great desire to get into the Court. That fact has been brought about by reason of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the  President  of the Court. The Labour party, however, has not been always so anxious to have these cases dealt with by judicial tribunals, nor have these Courts always been so popular. I can refer to an unfortunate experience, so far as the Industrial Appeals Court of Victoria was concerned. In one case, an appeal was made to it from the Artificial Manures Board determination, which awarded  40s.  6d. to certain workmen for a certain class of work. The Court was presided over by one of our leading Judges, and a man equally as conscientious as is the  President  of the Arbitration Court. He saw fit to reduce the award from  40s.  6d. to  36s.  The result was that he was most maliciously attacked in labour circles, and an agitation was started for a repeal of the Act. The Judge threatened to resign his position ; but I believe a compromise was brought about whereby those good things which were enjoyed by him were to be shared in turn by each member of the Supreme Court bench. However, as a consequence, this industrial tribunal became quite an unpopular Court. We, therefore, must not be led away by the passing popu- </para>

If one or two adverse verdicts or awards were given, the probabilities are that the experience of the Victorian Court would be repeated. I say this, because there is always a band of agitators ready to misconstrue what is done, and whose aim in life is to create discontent. While the conception of the Arbitration Court was great, and the anxiety of all of us was to secure a tribunal for the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes, and to put an end, so far as we possibly could, to locks-out and strikes, the experience in connexion with that Court has not been so completely satisfactory as one could wish. In fact, the experience of Arbitration Courts generally has caused us to think very seriously whether our ideal has been realized to the extent that we could have desired.

                            <para>- I propose afterwards, if the honorable member so desires, to deal with our experience of arbitration in Australia. Let me first deal with New Zealand. I regret to have to say that there is a certain section in the community, whom I call political unionists, who are all for arbitration so long as the awards are. in their favour, but so soon as the awards are not in their favour, no one is stronger in condemnation of arbitration than they are. That tendency has gone so far that these tribunals have been ignored, and in a number of cases awards have been defied instead of being generously accepted as it was anticipated under the provisions of the arbitration scheme that they would be. </para>

                            <para>- I have admitted it, but arbitration cannot bind one side and not the other. The idea and scheme of arbitration is to arrive at a peaceful settlement by a determination which both sides are in honour bound to accept, whether it is for or against them. The following interesting extract from the <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand Dominion</inline> of 7th October,  1911,  has come under my notice: - </para>

                        <para>The statement made by the Honorable ]. A. Millar in the House of Representatives yesterday in which he admitted that the Arbitration Court had failed to achieve in full the purpose for which it was intended has caused employers and labour leaders to think more than a little. When the Arbitration Act was first made law, unions crowded one another in their eagerness to register under it, but nowadays, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Millar</inline> admitted, the larger unions were one by one cancelling their registration, until presently there would be none left.  His  opinion was that the cause of the defection was the constitution or the personnel of the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>Unfortunately the Minister has discovered the true position too late. The agitation from the Labour side against existing conditions has now developed until it has become an agitation against arbitration. Primarily it was an agitation against the decisions of the Court. From this it has been an easy transition to the conclusion that arbitration is not as good as the strike, and in view of the fact that the majority of the workers in New Zealand have had no practical experience of the strike for the last twenty years, the new creed is being swallowed. I am satisfied that nothing that is now done by Parliament or by anybody else will stall off the impending disaster of a strike. My own opinion is that it will come about the end of the present year, and that when it does come it will not be among those who have condemned arbitration so much, but among men who have given the present Court several trials. This view as to the early occurrence of the strike is not shared by a good many in the Labour movement. They think it is rather farther away than that - probably five or six months hence. An arrangement has been made to place the decisions of the Trades Conference before the Prime Minister, but, unfortunately, owing to his illness this had to be postponed. I had been entrusted with the task of dealing with the grievances of the unions against the  President  of the Arbitration Court. I felt that the task was an extremely painful one, but still we are all agreed that it is one that has become necessary. </para>
                        <para>What I think is due to happen is a very serious industrial upheaval, and then it will be for the Parliament of this country to determine whether the Act will be retained for the protection of unskilled labourers and women workers, or whether the action of those who have endeavoured to wreck the arbitration system is to be allowed to prevail. Of . course, we realize that there are certain unions that can act unitedly and independent of protective legislation. They can have their agreements observed by resorting to force, but there are many such organizations not so situated. If these workers had not the course of law behind their industrial awards, free contract would prevail as between master and employe. And this would be to the detriment of the employes in those trades. _ My opinion about the cancellation of registrations of the unions is that the unions who take this step ought to have some consideration for the classes of labour that are not independent of the law, and that while they are warranted in withdrawing from the Act, since they feel that they can do better outside its scope, they are not warranted in creating  an  impression that the strike is preferable to arbitration for New Zealand experience is in the contrary direction. I hope that the Arbitration Act will be retained, but whether or not any alteration is now made in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Court I am satisfied that we cannot undo the mischief that has been done in the. last three years. This cannot be undone by anything short of a strike, and a strike will surely come. The fact is that every union in New Zealand is distrustful of Judge Sim, and having once made up their minds about this, they look round for a better method. Then they hit upon the strike. The strike notion has got into their blood, and nothing we can do can prevent  a  strike from happening. </para>

                    <para class="block">He goes on to show that Conciliation Councils are of no value. What, however, I want to urge, is that amongst the Labour party in New Zealand, the value oi arbitration settlements - and I regret that it should be so - has been seriously shaken. The Act came into force some twenty years ago, and worked very well for a while, but latterly there have been such protestations in favour of striking that the whole value of the legislation has been doubted. Indeed, it became necessary that an Act should be passed to strengthen the law. The new law came into force in 1908. It was, however, defied within twelve months. The case which arose out of the defiance of it was, I think, either the case of the miners, or one in connexion with the frozen meat industry. In the latter case, the slaughtermen were paid something like  £1  for 100 freezers. They were able to earn something like  £5  or <inline font-style="italic">£,7</inline> a week. When the award had nominally expired, but was in actual operation, and before a new award had been made, the slaughtermen determined on a strike, insisting on the payment of 25s. per 100, which would enable them to earn something like ^7 to ^10 per week. The point that I am urging in this connexion is that this is typical of several instances where strikes have lately taken place in New Zealand, and where parties have not been prepared to abide by the award of the arbitration tribunal, which was established with the express purpose of avoiding strikes. In New South Wales, the arbitration system came into operation in 1901, and within twelve months there was a serious strike. </para>

                            <para>- In New South Wales, Victoria, and, particularly, Western Australia. As my honorable friend is so anxious to learn, I will give him some particulars. A compulsory Arbitration Act was passed in New South Wales in 1901, and within twelve months, there was a strike on the part of the Australian Workers Union. In January, 1904, there was a strike on the Teralba coal-field.. An award -came into force on the 1st of that month, and the men struck on 3rd January. One hundred and twenty men were summoned for a breach of the award, but the case was dismissed on the technical objection that the award had not stipulated that the men must work. Again, in 1904, there was the Newcastle strike. In that case 252 wheelers went out, refusing to work, and something like 5,000 to 6,000 miners became idle. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend knows very well that if there had been any great anxiety on the part of the men to have their case heard by the Arbitration Court, there would have been no difficulty in doing so. Ultimately, the Court made an order that the wheelers were to go back to work, and that if they declined, the miners should do their own wheeling. But the order was disregarded, both by the wheelers and the miners. The point that I am trying to illustrate is that the men in some cases, have not been prepared to accept awards of the arbitration tribunal, and that they have not, in other instances, seen fit to resort to this tribunal, which was constituted for the very purpose of the pacific settlement of industrial disputes. I need hardly remind honorable members of the Peter Bowling strike of 1909, with the facts of which they are familiar. We have also had experience of arbitration in Western Australia. The awards of the Court in that State have chiefly dealt with mining and saw-milling. The general experience there has been that when the awards were in favour of a union they were accepted, but when they were not favorable, they were defied. In Victoria the same antagonistic spirit has prevailed, fortunately in only some two or three cases. In the case of the Plate-glass Bevellers Board a. certain award was made granting, I think, 48s. per week to the men. They went on strike, demanding 60s. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether they have or not. But I do know that, in those industries where employers have been cited to the Court they have accepted the decisions. In Victoria,  in 1754 <inline font-style="italic">Conciliation and</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Arbitration Bill.</inline> 1 910, there was a strike of the men in the Timber Sorters and. Stackers Union, notwithstanding that they were affected by an award. Under these circumstances, I venture to contend that, unless there is going to be a willingness, and even an anxiety, on the part of all sides, to accept this means of settlement, we cannot possibly hope for success. I firmly believe that the awards would be accepted by the workers generally were they not badly led, and if discontent were not generated by paid agitators. The Wages Board system is completely in harmony with the Federal Constitution, which reserves industrial power to the States alone. The Wages Boards have been successful in this State, except in one or two cases. </para>

                            <para>- As my honorable friend reminds me, it very often happens that, as soon as a decision is given, steps are taken to upset it. The experience of Victoria has been such that we are warranted in building our peaceful efforts towards industrial settlement upon these lines. According to an official return, up to December, 1909, a total increase of £3,500,000 has been paid to the workers under the determinations of Wages Boards ; and I have no hesitation in stating that the total increase to the present time has approached £5,000,000. We have the experience of the working of Wages Boards to guide us. </para>

                            <para>- There may have been abuses; but no one claims perfection for the Wages Board or any other tribunal. In my opinion, the scheme of this Bill is wrong, and the time has arrived when, in the light of our experience, not only under the Federal Arbitration Act, but also under the Wages Board system, we should take Wages Boards as the foundation of our industrial system ; and, from that foundation, build up a means of dealing with disputes. No one is more anxious than I am that we should deal with the subject in a comprehensive and thorough way; I think that the Arbitration Court is not as satisfactory as it might be; and the remarks of honorable members on the other side have confirmed my opinion. I, therefore, wish to recall a scheme which embodied my opinion, and the view of my colleagues at the time, as to the proper means of dealing with this question. Our first aim was to encourage the States to deal with industrial matters ; next, it was essential that a Federal tribunal should be constituted for the purpose of co-ordinating wages, having due regard to economic conditions, as far as possible, and removing the causes of unfair competition or differences between several States. </para>

                            <para>- We intended to establish an Inter-State Commission. The Bill which I had the honour to introduce in the Senate provided that an Inter-State Commission, consisting of three persons, might call in experts or assessors in order to aid them in dealing with a particular industry, or that any member of that body might call to his aid these experts or assessors for the purpose of dealing with a special industry. It would, of course, deal with cases referred to it, and with appeals, and would possess original jurisdiction where no industrial tribunal existed in any State. Our idea was that legislative power should be given to the Inter-State Commission. </para>

                            <para>- Our idea was, that, as power is given to the Governor in Council of a State, to deal in detail with Wages Boards, and with various industries, to bring about their complete adaptability to the conditions of the industries, the InterState Commission should have power to deal with the immediate conditions of each industry and, having regard to such conditions, to legislate accordingly in all those cases within its jurisdiction, including, of course, disputes extending beyond one State to another. That was proposed to be done in our Bill. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports  takes the objection that, under the present -Constitution, we have no power to do that. I would remind him that we have the power to do it in this way. </para>

                            <para>- There was the definite policy of the late Government to establish a means of securing industrial peace in the country. Since the Arbitration Court has become clogged, and we realize that, in nine cases out of ten, the  President  exercises the functions of an industrial expert rather than those of a Judicial  Court7  I do feel that the time has arrived when we should constitute a different tribunal. I strongly urge upon the House that an effective solution of this trouble is to have an adaptable tribunal, that is, a tribunal representative of employer and employ^, with a Judge as  chairman,  and capable of exercising the functions of industrial experts, and with a knowledge of the industrial conditions in each trade. It would also be capable of exercising the legislative powers which are now exercised by the Arbitration Court. A Board of that character is, I venture to think, likely to succeed where the present tribunal cannot hope to succeed. If, by the passing of this Bill, we create additional work, and practically concentrate the control of all industries, in the Arbitration Court, we shall court failure and disaster, do injustice to the States, and subvert the Constitution, without advancing a scheme for securing industrial peace. The measure will, I fear, create means for further dispute, and the worst and most barbarous forms of strikes and locks-out. </para>

                        <para>.- It has been clearly shown on both sides of the House, especially by the honorable member for Flinders, the honorable member for Ballarat, the honorable member for Darling Downs, the honorable member for Angas, and others, that the proposed amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is more likely to increase than to reduce complications. I feel certain that the greater part of the people in Australia would welcome a solution of the present difficulty. No doubt industrial peace would be more than acceptable in any country, but the means by which to obtain it seem far away at present. The alteration of the definition of " industry " to include trades and callings will not, in my opinion, in any way reduce the trouble. The Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, I may say, some of the State Arbitration Courts, appear to have created difficulties instead of removing them. The Prime Minister said that but for the Arbitration Court there would have been many more disputes; but I do not agree with him, seeing that disputes have been created purposely to bring questions before the Courts both of the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- It is something like the compliment that the people in America paid, when, in order to start a cemetery, they had, in consequence of the healthy climate they enjoyed, to kill a man.  The dispute in the timber trade in Western Australia was referred to the Arbitration Court of the State, but the decision was not accepted by the men. They held out for months, and agitators were sent all over Australia, in an endeavour to prove that the trouble extended beyond the limits of a State. We all know that, when the matter was referred to the Federal Arbitration Court, no redress was given; and, in- the end, an amicable arrangement was arrived at between the employers  and the employes, who have been working very well under it ever since. I can also instance the arrangements made from time to time between the employers and the lumpers at Fremantle, and similarly in the mining industry at Kalgoorlie, without resort to arbitration. We may say that there has been industrial peace at Kalgoorlie from start to finish, so far as the miners are concerned, simply because both sides have the common sense to pick out their best men to meet together and fix up some reasonable settlement somewhat on the lines of the Victorian Wages Boards. All these are mutual arrangements made without reference to any Act of Parliament. In the past employers have been compelled to obey awards, but I know of -no means by which employes can be compelled to obey them. The latter generally obey an award if it suits them, and at no other time; and I do not think there is any honorable member who could suggest how compulsion could be exercised. It is the old story of the man who said, " I do not believe in arbitration, for did we not refer our case to arbitration, and it went against us?" There is a general feeling amongst the men against both the State and Commonwealth Arbitration Courts ; and there is no doubt in my mind that the Wages Board system, as adopted in Victoria, is the best possible means devised up to the present for obtaining industrial peace. In the case of the Wages Boards, so much can go unsaid, because each side sends, representatives who thoroughly understand the subject, whereas, when they go before a Judge, both sides are practically fooling that Judge, and whoever can fool him most gets the best decision. As one of the present Judges of the High Court said, when speaking of the Inter-State Commission, " it must be recognised that legal knowledge is not necessary, or is not the best knowledge, for the settlement of commercial propositions." I should like Parliament to be able to approach a question of this kind without any quibbling, and devise some means, not only for settling disputes, but for suppressing the men who live by creating trouble between the two parties. </para>

                            <para>- I have never tried it; but, perhaps, the honorable member speaks with authority. Throughout my life, I have always endeavoured to work amicably with employes, and have succeeded fairly well. If we are to have industrial peace, we must find a way to suppress those irresponsible men who try to bring themselves into notoriety at the expense of .the trade unions or the employers. That class of agitator or person should be treated somewhat in the same manner as are offenders under the Licensing Act. Those who deal in liquor have to do so within certain hours and .under certain conditions, and if they transgress the law they come under its penal provisions. I fail to see why the agitator, who is outside the limits of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act - who runs, as it were, a little union on his own - should not be treated just as the sly-grog seller is. I believe that every union, or body of men, registered under a Conciliation and Arbitration Act would join in demanding that such people should be subject to the penal provisions of the law. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going into those questions more than to say that that money would not have been taken out of those people's pockets had it not been for the Federal Arbitration Court. In Victoria, there are about 100 Wages Boards doing good work ; and I am glad to say that the system is being adopted in other States. It may be said that unions would be in a better position if they were registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act ; but I believe they will never be a success until they are built on a different foundation. What I mean is that competency should be the first consideration, especially when a handicraft is in question. Much has been said here about lawyers, chemists, doctors, and others belonging to unions ; but we have heard little of what members of these professions have to go through before they are admitted. They have to spend a great part of their lives in study, as many honorable members know from personal experience, and until they have passed examinations and shown their competency they are not allowed to be members of the profession. It would be better if the old system, once in vogue in England and other places, were adopted. I should like to see the time when young fellows would have to serve a certain term and prove their competency before being allowed to join a union. Under such circumstances, employers would be only too pleased to apply to the unions for men. I know of very few unions in which numbers are not considered before competency. I should like to see competency made the key that would open the door to the joining of a union. Under the old English system, it was impossible for a man to join a guild unless he could produce his indentures, bearing the signature of his late employer, to prove that he was a competent tradesman. Indeed, in those days a man could not obtain a position in London without producing his indentures. There is a time in the life of every young fellow when he thinks that he is hardly dealt with because he is compelled to stick closely to his calling, trade, or profession. Parents have a lot to do to keep their sons up to the mark, so far as their trade or profession is concerned, at a certain period of their lives ; but in nineteen cases out of twenty these young fellows live to thank their parents for having kept them up to their work. If parents would adopt the same attitude nowadays, then young fellows, having completed their course, would join unions, and the unions would be looked upon as something worth registering and worth having in Australia. But what is the position to-day ? In many cases, a union will demand the reinstatement of an incompetent man, or a man who has broken the working rules of his employer. I know of an instance where it was part of a man's work, one Sunday out of ten, to attend to some horses. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; even horses eat on Sundays. There were about ten drivers in the employ of the firm in question, so that each man had to go on duty about once in every ten Sundays, and he took the pay for that Sunday work. One of these men, however, left the horses without food one Sunday, and they were going out on the Monday morning without food or drink, when this neglect was discovered. When the man offended in this way a second time, he was discharged ; but his brother drivers demanded that he should be reinstated, and that the man who dismissed him should be put off. That is the sort of thing that brings a union into disrepute. I may mention that the overseer was not put off, and that when the bulk of the men, other than the drivers, employed by the firm heard the facts, they said that the offending driver should be sent about his business. The awards of the Arbitration Courts, as at present constituted, will never be enforced, so far as the employes are concerned, until they are required by law to deposit with the Court a certain amount, to be forfeited in the event of disobedience of an award. A private employer, or a company, has assets which may be levied upon in respect of any fine for disobedience of an award; but as long as the position is as one-sided as it is at present, we shall never have industrial peace. </para>

                            <para>- As a first step, I would suggest that, instead of calling upon the offending organization to pay a fine, we should disfranchise every member of it until after the next ensuing election. If the men were called upon to pay a fine, their wives- and families might suffer ; but if they knew that disobedience of an award would lead to their disfranchisement, they would think twice before they disobeyed it. Such a form of punishment would also bring to bear upon the men another important influence in- that it would cause members of. the Labour party, who represent these unions, to say to them, " Obey the awards of the Court, for if you do not, there will be no one to vote for us at the next election." </para>

                            <para>- Surely I am not to be held responsible for everything that takes place in this country. Owing to special circumstances workers in different industries in Australia often receive higher rates of pay than would be awarded by any Arbitration Court. Having been through the Broken Hill rush, and also the Kalgoorlie rush, I can speak from experience. In the first-named case men were able to leave Adelaide at night, and to arrive next day at Broken Hill, where they found waiting them work for which they received three times the wages that were offering in the city from which they came. No award made by a Court could meet special circumstances of that kind. The position was the same at Kalgoorlie, where, perhaps, the highest wages ever paid in Australia, were paid in the early days. Men could earn there within a fortnight of their arrival sufficient to pay for their passage from the pastern States to Fremantle, and their railway fare thence to the gold-fields. I hope that we shall have many such rushes, for I like to s'ae new districts developed, and new towns springing up. Men so situated would not be so foolish as to say, " We are governed by an award made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in Melbourne." With them it would be a question of supply and demand, and they would have a right to take advantage of the position. </para>

                            <para>- That can not be regulated by Acts of Parliament. I fear that we are legislating on the foundation of our continued prosperity. We have enjoyed a time of great prosperity,, and long may it continue; but with a bad season or two there would be nothing to refer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The attempt now being made to control from one centre all the industrial concerns of this great continent is something like trying to establish a successful irrigation scheme by running all the waters of a State into one given place, instead of impounding it in the several districts where it could be successfully used. Half-a-dozen rivers might be running into one stream, and on each of them a good irrigation system could be established. But what would be the position if we passed an Act of Parliament declaring that the people should divert .all the water to one centre whence it could be pumped back to the points at which it ought originally to have been conserved, and at which it could be advantageously used? That is really what the Governments are trying to do in regard to industrial legislation. They are trying to bring the whole  control of the industrial life of Australia into one given centre, whence it is to be pumped out again all over the Commonwealth, and sprinkled over every State. I should not be surprised to see in one of our comic papers a cartoon depicting, a huge Commonwealth squirt spraying industrial awards all over the State. TheGovernment and their supporters would have us believe- that this system is to be carried out without cost to those concerned,, but one of - their number has admitted by way of interjection that it cost £30,000 to settle one industrial dispute through the medium of the Commonwealth Conciliation, and Arbitration Court. Surely so expensive a system cannot be beneficial either to employés or employers. The best system to adopt is that of State control as far as possible. A uniform system of Wages Boards in all the States would be the foundation of industrial peace. Wages Boards, dealing with the same callings, are also necessary in different parts of the States, because local knowledge is always required in the settlement of local troubles. If there were a uniform system of Wages Boards for Australia, the settlement of industrial troubles could be left to them, with an appeal to the County Court Judges when there was disagreement, the Judges having the right to refer Inter-State' disputes to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The provision in the Constitution enabling this Parliament to make laws with respect to conciliation and arbitration did not contemplate the establishment of a Court for dealing with all the trivial disputes purposely created by agitators. It was the settlement of disputes extending beyond the area of one State in regard to businesses like shipping, that the framers of the Constitution had in mind. The success which Wages Boards have achieved in Victoria is attested by the fact that the system has been copied in other States. I believe that Wages Boards are better than Arbitration Courts. Judges know nothing of industrial matters. Their training may enable them to decide points of law, but no workman would admit that a Judge knew ;is much about his business as he or his fellows. N'o Judge, however honest and capable, knows the ins-and-outs of a business like those engaged in it. The members of an industry are more satisfied with an award given by a Board on which they have been represented than by any decision of a Court. The speech of the honorable member for Flinders made it clear to me that the Government has dealt with this question on the advice of a 30s. -a- week lawyer, when it should have secured the assistance of a £5,ooo a-year man. The debate has shown that it is ten to one that the amendments proposed by the Government in this Bill are unconstitutional ; and it is twenty to one that they will increase trouble, and, in fact, create chaos. But Australia expects us to devise means to obtain industrial peace; and, if Ministers sincerely desire to do this, they will put aside all party feeling, and propose a system for the settlement of disputes which will benefit this great country. Our country is second to none on earth ; and I hope to see the time when employes and employers will be pulling together. When some of the horses in a team are holding back, and others are pulling, not much progress is made. In my opinion, the amendments proposed by the Government should be thrown on one side, and a uniform system of Wages Boards adopted. Nothing is to be gained by passing amendments which will not meet the case. The High Court has already declared much of our legislation to be unconstitutional. It has, for instance, ruled the union label and harvester provisions to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> The proposals now under discussion will also be thrown into the waste-paper basket. </para>

                    <para class="block">After being closeted for four nights and days, this is the egg which the honorable members for Ballarat, Parramatta, and Darling Downs have produced. They are now trying to hatch it; but I predict that it will be addled. The honorable member for Parramatta was shadowed by the representative of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> the honorable member for Ballarat by the representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and the honorable member for Darling Downs by the representatives of the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail.</inline> With the help of the legal members on the front Opposition bench, they have not been able to bring forward anything better than this amendment. But there is no preference to unionists here. I can claim to be as much a legal authority as are the honorable members for Ballarat, Flinders, and Darling Downs, and I have a number of law books from which I can quote, just as they have done. What makes me sure that we are on the right track is the fact that the members on the Opposition benches are all calamity howlers. God alone knows what will happen. They do not, and we do not. Everything rests with the High Court. The debate is likely to prove the most valuable that we have had since the White Australia question was being discussed, because it will show the general public, and particularly the workers, whom the honorable member for Fremantle wants to put in their proper place- </para>

                            <para>- Not half-a-dozen members of this House understood thoroughly the provisions of the Constitution, and the people certainly did not understand it, when they voted for it. Although it is only twelve years since the Enabling Bill was passed through all the State Parliaments, I could not get a copy of the Queensland Bill twelve months ago when in the western parts of that State. I strongly opposed Federation, because I thought that we should do better by waiting. </para>

This debate is one of the best that has ever taken place, particularly from the workers' point of view. Several honorable members have denounced us, saying that we will not obey an award when it is given. Only two awards have been given for the whole of Australia, and both have been implicitly obeyed. One is the award by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor for the Australian Workers Union, and the other is the " shandy-gaff " award for the bootmakers. It is a strange thing that every member who has risen on the Opposition benches has stated repeatedly, and with very marked effect, " We believe in unionism, but - " and a very big " but," too. They balk at the " but," as a horse often balks at a fence. </para>

                            <para>- We have compulsory conciliation and arbitration now in the Australian Workers Union, and, as I have said times out of number on the floor of this chamber, my advice always is, " Obey that award implicitly." That is also the advice of every one of our leaders in the Labour party. But when there is no award, or only a shandygaff arrangement, the right to strike should be inherent in every worker. Let me tell the honorable member for Richmond that men do not go out on strike for fun. There is no fun in it so far as the worker is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot tell the honorable member my position in any plainer language than I have already used. If a conciliation and arbitration award is given, both sides should obey it, and, so far as I am concerned, I shall do my best to make the workers obey it. In fact, I would go almost as far as the honorable member for Fremantle went. He said he would deprive them of their votes ! When the honorable member for Fremantle made that suggestion, surely he did not realize its seriousness. If put into practice, it would deprive this House of some of its most voluble members. </para>

                            <para>- It all depends on what the honorable member calls ornaments. The honorable member for Echuca adorns the assembly in one way, the honorable member for Maranoa adorns it in a totally different way. The majority of the people of Maranoa believe in their adornment, and would not have the adornment which the honorable member for Echuca would confer upon them ; while, perhaps, the constituents of the honorable member for Echuca would not accept an adornment for their district like the honorable member for Maranoa. As I told the honorable member for Richmond, there is no fun in going out on strike. The working man has nothing to lose but his labour, and his labour in 999 cases out of 1,000 means bread and butter for his wife, his children, and himself. It puts me in mind of a cartoon I saw once depicting a splendid dinner inside an alligator's mouth, with the words, " Take it, or work." If the man had taken it, the jaws would have come down, and he would have lost his life. The worker has to lose practically all that he has with which to buy food for his wife and family. Once a worker loses that money, it is gone from him for ever. There is no hope of his ever making it up, and so the honorable member for Richmond had better disabuse his mind of the idea that workers go out on strike for the fun of the thing. There is no fun in it for either side. I shall read a statement of the decisions of the High Court in regard to the measures passed by this Parliament for the alleviation of industrial trouble throughout the length and breadth of Australia, in order to let the people of the country know what the position now is. I propose now to assume the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of a lawyer without preference. These are the decisions of the High Court - </para>

                            <para>- I have no recollection of anything of the kind. The Bills were introduced by the honorable member for Ballarat, the honorable member for Darling Downs, and the honorable member for Angas, all of whom were Attorneys- General. In fact, the whole of the Opposition front bench is full of lawyers at this moment. There they are, sitting like crows upon a fence, ready to pounce down on a few poor maggots ! Surely those gentlemen ought to have known it if the measures for which they are responsible were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> They were rogues, or they were fools, if they did not know. Either they introduced these measures wilfully or they did not understand what they were doing. </para>

                            <para>- I never said such a thing; or, rather, if I did, let me correct myself at once. I do not think that the Bill will be declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> If there is one thing more than another that convinces me that it is not, it is the way the lawyers opposite are opposing it. At any rate, I am quite willing to take the risk for the sake of making the compulsory Conciliation and Arbitration Act effective. Today it is ineffective, and we have good reason to believe that this measure will serve the purpose for which it has been introduced. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable member believe all the lawyers tell him? I gave him credit for having more sense. If he had read the judgments of the High Court he would have known that the Judges were equally divided with regard to this legislation, and that it was the Chief Justice's verdict that decided the matter. How do honorable members opposite explain that ? Is that the judgment of one man or of two or three? I listened to the honorable member . for Darling Downs very intently on Friday last. He quoted from a number of legal authorities to show why this measure was unconstitutional. The whole of his argument concentrated round the point that we were going to allow one man to control the whole of the industries of Australia. Is that the cause of contention? With all due deference to the Chief Justice of Australia - and I believe that he is one of the soundest lawyers in the Commonwealth - I venture to say that he is the one man who has determined that so much of our legislation is <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline><inline font-style="italic">vires.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The lawyers earn their money ; I am satisfied about that. Being a layman - and one of the " common or garden " variety of laymen at that - I must say that some of these judgments are couched in plain unvarnished language that any ordinary individual can understand. I expected to find a lot of legal phrases and technicalities. But the language is as clear as any man could possibly desire it to <inline font-style="italic">\x.</inline> As I have said, I do not find fault with them. What I am finding fault with is that it seems very peculiar to me - as it seems very peculiar to the ordinary working man outside - that the awards should be upset in such a maimer. There is one case in particular in which the Registrar had registered a union and an award had been given. The case was sent to the High Court, and a question of jurisdiction was raised. The award was ruled out by the Court - rightly, I believe, after reading the judgment. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> why cannot we have a Board with two men on it representing the employers, and two representing the employes, to go through their mutual differences and refer any question of law to the Judge? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any reasonable man - any man who has at heart the benefit of his union, or the cause of industrial peace and the welfare of Australia - would refuse to accept that position. He would accept it gladly. That is how the matter appeals to me. Notwithstanding what others have said, there is only one point of difference as regards compulsory conciliation and arbitration between the honorable member for Flinders and myself. He does not believe in State and Commonwealth servants coming under an award of the Court. There we differ. But I say that if we could make it compulsory for employes and' employers to come together in that way, I would vote for it. Something should be done, and done speedily, to bring about conciliation and arbitration in a proper spirit. We should not have it as it is at present, so that if an award pleases, it is obeyed, and if it does not please, the parties will not have it. I do not know whether I would be in order in referring to the case just concluded affecting the Australian Workers Union. It has cost our union some thousands of pounds. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry for transgressing, sir. The time has come when something will have to be done by both sides of the House to stop this spending of money on conciliation and arbitration cases. In conversation with several lawyers, I found that they are not anxious that this state of things should continue. Of course, many of us say at. times that the lawyers carry on cases for the purpose of making money. But there are plenty of other ways of making money without making it out of conciliation and arbitration cases; and the men who are engaged in this particular business are quite willing that something on the lines I have suggested should be brought about. With regard to the judgments given by the High Court against the Arbitration Court, it is right ..and proper, I think, that the awards should be 1764 <inline font-style="italic">Conciliation and</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Arbitration Bill.</inline> quoted in this debate. I do not intend to quote them fully, because, after perusing several volumes of the reports, I made a discovery which saved me a lot of time. I discovered that all I wanted to know was published at the beginning of the reports; but I did not make that discovery until I had gone through several volumes. It is said that a person who is learning a thing anew, always takes the longest road before he finds the shortest one. I only intend to quote a few of the cases, and particularly that which is known generally as the new Protection case. Notwithstanding what has been said both here and outside, I am satisfied that the Government of the day were faithful and true in introducing the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill. I believe that they thought that they had the power to do that which they tried to do. I do not want to condemn any Government, or any individual. I believe that the Government of the day tried their best, and failed. </para>

                            <para>- That is, I think, an answer to the honorable member for Echuca. There is the position in a nutshell. Who was more disappointed at the judgment in that case than were the workers in connexion with the agricultural implement industry? Some of them went so far as to say that it was a put-up job. Now, there was no job about the matter at all. What was done was done in all good faith by the Government of the day; and, as I said before, we got legislation by the High Court. The workers of Australia are beginning to be alive to the fact that there is something radically wrong in the state of Denmark when we pass legislation here and the High Court knocks it out. One can get on a platform and speak for hour after hour, but one cannot make them understand the position. </para>

                            <para>- I would like the honorable member to tell me what the High Court did with the Act if they did not knock it out. It is no good, and when a man. is knocked out he is no good ; that is a certainty. The Chief Justice winds up a judgment with very few words, and that puts the kibosh on the Act. Whether it is knocked out or knocked in or knocked endways, it is out all the same. I am not complaining, I repeat, about the High Court, but the people are. I venture to say, in passing, that when we take the next referendum and distribute the debate on the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, we shall dance to' quite another tune. This matter is affecting the people vitally, and it is said that one cannot hurt a man worse than by touching his breeches' pocket. That is just what the High Court is doing, and it is one of the best object-lessons that the people can have before we take the next referendum. I hold in my hand a letter which was casually referred to by the honorable member for Dalley, but it contains one or two little items which I think call for notice from me as a member of the House of Representatives, and a member of the Australian Workers Union. It is, I see, signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole.</inline> I congratulate honorable members opposite upon having their old friend back in harness. He is one of the best organizers we have ever had in the Commonwealth, and is paid by the Employers' Federation. We have nothing to cavil about with regard to this gentleman, 1 can assure my honorable friends. This is the gentleman who gained notoriety a few years ago in Victoria by telling the people of Lilydale that for the workers marriage was a luxury, and that the employers were not going to pay for them to have more pints of beer and to get married. If marriage is a luxury, then God help this country. The letter reads as follows :  - </para>

                        1765 last Federal election. Up to that time what did we have but class legislation? Until the creation of this Federal Parliament with a Senate and a House of Representatives elected by those of the full age of twenty-one years, when did we have representative government in Australia ? When did we see or hear the voice of the people until that event? But in ten years from the inception of Federation what did we find ? We found a whole reversal of form in favour of this dastardly Labour party. I have related times without number how Labour members were treated in Queensland fifteen or sixteen years ago. To-day the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches, and have what no previous Federal Government had, and that is a majority of Labour men in each House of this Parliament. At the last election the people spoke with one emphatic voice. It was no one State more than another which spoke; all the States spoke, and even Conservative Tasmania sent more than her quota.

As it is, they are not, and some of them went to law, only to. find that they had no redress. That is the position in a nutshell. It is the desire of the Labour party that the principle of conciliation and arbitration shall be carried out in its entirety. No matter what capital the Opposition may try to make out of my statement that I am for the striker every time, that is absolutely our desire. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I alone am responsible' tor any statement that I make in this House. I " carry the baby " myself, and am quite willing to carry it. I do not desire that any other man shall be saddled with the responsibility for my utterances in this Chamber; but, knowing what I do, and feeling as I do, my sympathies are with the strikers every time. I am not in favour of strikes, for the reason that, whether the men win or lose, they are, in fact, the losers every time, and their wives and families must suffer. My experience of big strikes in Australia is that women are better strikers than are men. I have known women, in several instances, to implore their husbands not to go " scabbing1" or  " blacklegging," but to stand their ground and go down with their colours flying. Under the condition of affairs that prevailed until a few years ago, men were slow to go on strike; but the tyrants of those days were the best organizers we ever had. The tramway employes of Brisbane are being subjected to tyranny by their employers, and I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Badger</inline> is the best organizer that the Tramway Union has. Let him continue on the track he is at present following, and if there is no " moral suasion " before long, my name is not Page. Tyranny drives men to do things that they would never think of doing in other circumstances, lt is tyranny that drives then* to think and act as they would not otherwise do. During the shearers strike of  1891  in Queensland, there were sent to gaol men who had no more criminal intent than has any honorable member of this House. But many who were then lodged with criminals at St. Helena are to-day occupying some of the highest positions in the Federal and State Parliaments. I sincerely hope, both as a member of this House and as a unionist, that the Bill will pass in its entirety. We shall then see whether the croakers of the Opposition - the calamity howlers - or the Government are right. I have so much confidence in the Government as to believe that they think they are on the right track, and consider that what they are doing is not to benefit themselves, but to alleviate the sufferings of the men, women, and children, not only of to-day, but of the years to come. I feel satisfied that, in the days to come, the workers will thank God that there was a Labour party in the National Parliament to try to bring about a better condition of things, both socially and industrially, than existed when they set out upon the work. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- One of the chief points made by the honorable member for Maranoa, in the course of his speech, was that something would have to be done to stop the spending of large sums of money to secure awards ; while another point raised by him referred to the difficulty that arises from time to time owing to the High Court declaring certain Acts to be unconstitutional. Unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of a Federal system of Government is that there must be a High Court, or some similar tribunal, to stand between the two sets of Parliaments which the sovereign people of Australia have set up. There being one sovereign people who can delegate only one sovereignty, it necessarily follows that once that sovereignty is; bisected, there must be set up some intermediary body to declare when, where, and! how far, either the one or the other of those Parliaments has exceeded that quantum of sovereign power vested by the sovereign people in their several Parliaments. That, if honorable members please, is one of the weaknesses of a Federal system; but, under our Federal! system, we have probably the most democratic form of government that the mind of" man has ever devised. </para>

I did not suggest for a moment that those who occupy the Government benches at the present time are more democratic than are the Opposition. The point I was making was that it was one of the necessary evils, if you. like, of a Federal system of government,, that certain legislation should be held from time to time to be unconstitutional. </para>

                            <para>- Even then, we should not get away from the judgments of the High Court in respect of other matters. The honorable member for Maranoa referred to decisions of the Court declaring unconstitutional certain enactments that were not entirely confined to the arbitration power. As to the other point raised by him, that something would have to be done to stop .the spending of money to secure "awards, I think it has been pointed out very effectually in this House that the steps which the Government of the day are taking to amend our existing industrial legislation, so far from being likely to reduce the expenditure of the unions in obtaining awards, will tend rather to impose upon them yet another financial burden. Notwithstanding the doubts which the honorable member expressed at the opening of his speech as to the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the members of the Opposition in their desire to see the principle of arbitration extended in the Commonwealth, I think it will be conceded1 that the general belief of all the members of this Chamber, with, perhaps, very few exceptions, is that it is by some system of compulsory arbitration that we shall best secure industrial peace and, with that, the </para>

We must all admit,_ also, that ever since we started along this particular pathway to try to devise means whereby employers and employed could be brought together in such a way that their difficulties and differences could be amicably settled, we have been experimenting. We have been trying to find out the best possible means to secure the ends that we all have in view ; and, although we may differ, and differ very widely, as to the means whereby those ends are best to be secured, that should not cause doubt to be thrown upon the
                        <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline>
                        of members in their desire to see this very desirable state of affairs brought about in Australia. The arbitration that we have known in Australia until now has been, both in the States and in the Commonwealth, on the lines of industrial organization. The disputes that have been dealt with have been those between employers and employes in homogeneous industries. In many cases the organization, so far as the employes have been concerned, has also been on the lines of craft unionism, the members of a craft being all engaged in the same industry. Arbitration requires the existence of two parties having a matter in dispute between them and a third party as arbitrator. On one side there must be the employers, and on the other the employes. To secure the representation of both," there must be a common basis of organization. Then an arbitrator can hold level the scales of justice. The Government, however, propose to depart widely from the present system, and to follow the suggestions of counsel for the claimant in the case of the Federated Engine-drivers Association. He argued that the community of interest is not between those producing the same commodity, hut between those employed in the same class of labour.  His  point was that if there was community of interest between the employes, the Court need not consider whether there was community of interest between the employers. But arbitration with only one party before the Court would be impossible. Under such circumstances, the Judge, instead of being an arbitrator, would be a dictator, and legislator. The industries in which engine-drivers are employed number pretty well all in the Commonwealth. If a Judge were called upon to make a determination regarding the wages, hours, and conditions to be observed throughout Australia for engine-drivers he would have to investigate the affairs of all those industries. That would be a terrific task to set any one man.

                            <para>- It is doubtful whether any man could undertake it at all, however willing and able. Yet that is the task which the Government proposes to set the  President  of the Arbitration Court. The question must also be asked : Would the Court, in making an award, be able to discriminate between one State and another? The honorable member for Maranoa desires that unions shall not be put to great expense by arbitration proceedings, but if the Bill becomes law, the scope of inquiries will be immensely extended, so that they must take longer, and cost more. Consequently, the cost of getting an award will, in many cases, be infinitely more than in the case which the honorable member cited a little earlier this evening. </para>

Consequently, if any award was given in an industry of that sort, he would probably think it incumbent upon him to grant an absolutely mechanical wage from one end of the Commonwealth to the other.

                            <para>- At any rate, I have quoted what he said. I would ask the honorable member for Maranoa to watch that the Government do not, by passing this Bill, hold out to the workers, to whose interests the honorable member would never do anything detrimental, a bait which will lead them to apply for awards at far greater expense than they have to go to now, and obtain them only to find that the whole basis of the measure is unconstitutional. The Government should be careful to see that that does not happen. If the recent referenda had been carried, this Bill would have had a much more serious effect than it probably will have now; but we must not lose sight of the fact that the Government intend to re-submit those questions to the people. If they do get the powers asked for, of course the Bill will operate. At present there is no power to make a common rule, and, consequently, no award is binding on those who are not parties to it. If those industrial proposals, as submitted at the referenda, are subsequently adopted by the people, and the power to make a common rule is given, we shall have 'an infinitely worse position than that which obtains to-day. As soon as a common rule can be made, those who are not parties to an award will nevertheless be bound by it. In industries which are scattered all over Australia, whilst under craft organization there is a community of interest among the employes, there is none among the employers. </para>

                            <para>- What community of interest can there be between the mineowners of Western Australia, the sawmillers of Northern Queensland, the butter- makers on the Richmond River, the soap-makers of Sydney, and the jam-makers of Hobart? Can the honorable member show me any basis of organization covering industries so widely dissimilar and scattered as they are? Whilst there is a basis of organization as far as some of the employes, such as the engine-drivers, are concerned - the men being all of one craft - there is of necessity no such basis for employers. The honorable member for Cook pointed out last week the difficulty that exists. There is no desire on this side of the House to interfere with organizations of employes as such. All that we are contending: for is that an award of the Arbitration Court shall be confined to an industry. Suppose that an industry such as jam making applies for an award. There is nothing whatever to prevent the secretary for the engine-drivers appearing before the Court and putting in a claim on behalf of the members of his union, provided, of course, that we make it legislatively possible. The same may be said with respect to the saw-milling, the freezing and other industries. I am sure that every one who had the pleasure of listening to the honorable member for North Sydney was very pleased to have the benefit of his experience, But at the same time I do not think that any honorable member who has spoken from the Ministerial benches has in any way answered the case which the honorable member for Cook put before us. </para>

                            <para>- The Government brought forward a Wages Board Bill, and, notwithstanding the bitter opposition of every Labour man in the State Parliament -who obstructed it at every stage, and voted against it on the third reading - the Liberal Government succeeded in passing the measure into law. During the first two years of its operation, up to the 30th July, 1910, 103 unions registered under the Act, and in two years they secured no fewer than 100 determinations. There were eighteen Wages Boards sitting at that particular moment. Sometimes there were as many as twenty-eight Boards sitting -at one time. </para>

                            <para>- Notwithstanding that the largest unions refused to register, that magnificent record was enabled to be put up in less than two years, whilst the Arbitration Court in more than three years only dealt with thirty-nine awards. In the first place we have to remember that the Arbitration Court in New South Wales was dealing with one State only. Here we are dealing with the whole of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, we are adding to the difficulties of the Arbitration Court six-fold, because we have six States to deal with. We are giving to its jurisdiction a much greater scope, and once we permit this particular class of organizations to register and appeal to the Court, then we shall practically drag in every industry throughout the Commonwealth. The industry with which my constituents and I are more particularly concerned is the rural industry. And great as the difficulties are in any organized industry confined to great centres of population - to mining, or any industry of that sort - once we bring under the operation of this law, agriculture, dairying, horticultural pursuits, and so on, we shall add, and add enormously, to the difficulties. Honorable members think, I presume, that if this Bill be passed into law the Rural Workers' Union, which is being formed from one end of the Commonwealth to another, will be one of the first unions to apply for an award. At the present time I repeat there is no power to make a common rule. Perhaps we need not be very much alarmed, because there will be a necessity to cite before the Court practically every farmer 'throughout he Commonwealth. But the moment my honorable friends get their constitutional proposals accepted "by the country the Court will have power to make a common rule, and then, of course, the award will apply to rural workers from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. When the question of including the rural workers was considered here last session, I opposed the proposal. I do not think we have yet devised a system of arbitration which is applicable to the rural industries. I do not think that we have yet obtained a system which is sufficiently flexible to meet the varying needs and conditions, and the various circumstances in which they are carried on. Again, I do not think that any system has yet been devised which is sufficiently elastic to meet the various seasonal changes. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely.  1  have an idea, which I do not want to take up time in giving to the House to-night. I may say, however, that I think something might be done which would help matters a little, and the foundation of the scheme I would suggest is that it must be limited in the scope of its operation to small areas. Unless that is done we shall never get a system of arbitration in regard to the rural industries which will work out with anything approaching equity or justice, or which will not hamper them in a way which I am sure will militate against our producing interests. </para>

                            <para>- No. It is not, in my opinion, a system, as it is now constituted, which would meet the existing difficulties in regard to rural pursuits. But when we come to attempt to apply this system we shall get the worst results which can be conceived of. Take such rural industries as wheat-growing, dairying, horticulture, viticulture, lucerne-growing, potato-growing, grazing, and, finally, purely agricultural farming, and fancy a judge being allotted the task of regulating all these rural industries, carried on as they are in every part of the Commonwealth under varying conditions. Wheat-growing, for instance, is carried on in different ways in various parts. Dairying is carried on under different conditions in various parts. Horticulture is also carried on in very different ways in various parts. May I ask he Attorney-General if he assents to the adjournment of the debate at this hour ? </para>

Honorable members will remember that to-morrow we are to have the honour of dining with the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, and so it is proposed to ask the House to adjourn at  6  o'clock. It is hoped that the final word in the debate just adjourned will be said by half-past5 o'clock, when the Attorney-General wishes to reply. That is the condition on which the honorable member for Richmond was allowed leave to continue his speech to-morrow. </para>

                    <para>. - I observed from the press to-day that last night the Prime. Minister addressed the public of Australia, or, at any rate, the public of Melbourne, on the subject of his recent mission to the Imperial Conference. As there was a very meagre report of the proceedings of last night, will the right honorable gentleman give the House an opportunity to hear him on the question? We should have had an opportunity before of hearing a statement from the Prime Minister concerning his mission to the heart of the Empire, because nothing could be more important, fraught as it is with great consequences to Australia. So far, however, he has not deigned to say a word on the matter to the House. </para>

                    <para>. - When I was asked on behalf of the University graduates to address them, I felt I ought to accede to the request. Originally it was intended that the lecture should be delivered in a smaller room, but those who had the management of the affair took the arrangements into their own hands, and I gladly fell in with what they had done. If an opportunity offers, I shall have no objection to say a few words to honorable members ; but those who have read the report will see that I dealt, not only with the Conference I had the honour to attend, but with the principles, genesis, and growth of Imperial Conferences, referring to my honorable friend the honorable member for Ballarat and other distinguished statesmen who took part in earlier gatherings. I was concerned more with the growth of the Conference principle than with the work done at the Conference of this year. </para>
