                            <para>- I merely wish the Minister to tell us what is meant by the words "towards cost"? I wish also to obtain some information with regard to the proposed vote of £22,500 towards the cost of the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. When the Bill providing for the construction of this line was introduced, it contained a provision practically making the Consolidated Revenue liable for the cost of construction, but on a question being raised by the Opposition the Prime Minister said that the Government would withdraw the appropriation clause. It was pointed out by the honorable member for Richmond that the procedure usually adopted in the State Parliaments in regard to the construction of railways is first of all to lay upon the table of the House plans and specifications and books of reference, showing the whole contemplated scheme. I do not know what is the practice in the other States, but the honorable member for Richmond said, quoting from the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that in Queensland, it was usual for the Parliament to refer the plans and books of reference to a Select Committee for report upon the proposed line. When the Prime Minister was reminded of this procedure by the Opposition, he, and the Minister of Home Affairs also, promised that, before an appropriation was made, detailed information would be laid before the House. The Minister, however, is now asking the Committee to make the first appropriation for the construction of the railway, although he has not submitted to us either plans, specifications, books of reference, or any information whatever. </para>

He has our support in carrying out this railway, and we are anxious that it shall be constructed as soon as possible; but there is a proper businesslike method of procedure to follow, and I submit that it has not been followed in this case. I presume that the Minister will lay on the table of the House books of reference and other information relating to this proposal. The Minister, by instinct, is a business man. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is always protesting that the House should follow business-like methods, and I am sure that if he were sitting in Opposition his businesslike capacity and instinct would lead to his insisting upon more information being given in this case. Will he tell us whether it is proposed to enter upon the work of constructing the line during the next twelve months ; and, also, whether the final survey has been made ? We should be put in the position that every State Parliament occupies before it authorizes any big undertaking. This proposed vote of  £22,500,  perhaps, is not intended for the actual construction of the line, but is designed merely to provide for preparatory work. The Minister will, I hope, give us some information on the subject. Let me make it perfectly clear that the Opposition are eager to assist him in his desire to carry out this work, but we want to know what we are doing. I presume that the honorable gentleman will submit to us a detailed estimate of the cost, based upon information as to the class of rails and other material to be used. I wish now to refer to the item of  £2,500  towards the construction and alteration of lighthouses, and I should like to know whether, during the next twelve months, a final decision will be arrived at regarding the lighthouses more urgently required upon the Australian coast. From two to four lighthouses need to be erected as soon as possible on "the Queensland coast, and one or two lights are also urgently required along the South Australian coast. The question is likewise of great importance to Tasmania and Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- All the States are interested in the matter. I understand that an officer has been appointed to furnish a report on this question of the lighting of the Australian coast. Can the Minister also state what particular lighthouses are likely to be undertaken this year ? I do not think there is any necessity to wait, because the Minister could easily determine upon several of the leading lighthouses that are necessary. He could proceed with the plans for their acquisition and construction, and, in the meantime, could make further inquiries as to lighthouses required in addition to those already mentioned in the report. I understand that on some part of the Queensland coast, and in other parts of Australia, improved beacons and minor guiding lights are required. Perhaps the Minister can explain what is being done in that respect. </para>

                        <para>.- Towards the close of the discussion on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Bill I suggested that the line should be extended along the 33rd parallel, from the neighbourhood of Lake Eyre, to connect up with Broken Hill, and thence due east to Sydney.I understand that, at present, the New South Wales Public Works Committee have before them a proposal to connect Broken Hill with Sydney, and, if the line were taken along the 33rd parallel, as I have suggested, we should have a transcontinental line not touching the sea, or approaching anywhere close enough to the sea to be attackable from the sea, between Sydney and Fremantle. That would be a great advance on the present proposal from a defence point of view. The Minister undertook at the time to take the suggestion into consideration, and I take this opportunity of urging upon him its extreme importance from a defence point of view. If any enemy gained the command of these seas, the line proposed in the Bill could be cut at Port Augusta with the utmost ease. </para>

                            <para>- I am not asking the Minister to alter the Bill. He could bring down an additional Bill. The section from Lake Eyre to Port Augusta, connecting the line with the South Australian system, is, I think, necessary in any case, but the direct line along the 33rd parallel to Broken Hill should be constructed coincidentally with that from Broken Hill to Sydney. I hope that, in the near future, we shall see a further Bill introduced for that purpose, from a defence point of view purely and simply. </para>

                        <para>. - Ever since it was intended that the Commonwealth should take'control of lighthouses, beacons, and buoys, the inefficiency of some of our lights, on account of the increased speed of vessels, and for other reasons, has been brought under my notice, and, probably, under the notice of other Ministers who preceded me in the Department. That is why I considered it advisable to obtain expert advice on the subject ; and no exception has been taken, so far as I know, to the qualifications of the gentleman appointed for that duty. It is not possible for the expert to inspect all the existing lights, except when the vessels which go out to providore them are available - that is once in every three or six months. As soon as Commander Brewis was appointed, we communicated with the States, and asked when their vessels would be going out, so that we could fit in his arrangements with them. Commander Brewis is now in Tasmanian waters. The honorable member for Darling Downs asks what lights are considered by the expert to be the most important. The only report which it has been possible for the expert to lay before the Department concerns the Bass Strait lights. Most people who use the sea consider that the south-eastern corner of Australia is the most dangerous. Captain after captain has said that he has practically passed the whole of the dangers before the Wilson's Promontory light opens out. Although only  £2,500  has been set down on the Estimates, that is considered sufficient to make a start with the most urgent lights. Speaking from memory, I believe that the recommendation is to alter the Wilson's Promontory light from a  12  -mile to a  25-mile  light, to place an unattended light upon one of the islands of the Glennie Group, and another unattended light at Cape Liptrap, and to alter the light further along to the east, at or near Cape Howe. It is estimated that  4,000  vessels pass that corner of Australia every year.' Although it was originally estimated that to alter the Wilson's Promontory light, and to put additional lights in the places I have named, would cost about  £60,000,  it is now possible, by the use of unattended acetylene lights, on what is known as the AGA system, for the same work to be done for less than  £8,000.  As soon as the Lighthouses Bill is passed, we shall proceed to take action in regard to this matter. The papers will be sent to the Department of Home Affairs, in order that the work may be put in hand as soon as possible. </para>

                            <para>- No j the Queensland report is being prepared. On the day when the expert arrived from New South Wales, there was an opportunity for him to go away in the tender that visits the Tasmanian lighthouses. He was only in Melbourne two or three hours, because he wished to make an inspection of the Tasmanian lighthouses immediately. As soon as I receive his report, I shall make recommendations to the Cabinet. If the amount already appropriated for the purpose is not sufficient to enable urgent and necessary work to be commenced, I shall recommend the Treasurer to bring down Supplementary Estimates, with a view of doing all that is necessary in that regard. As to beacons, I understand that the expert will make some recommendations with regard to the Barrier Reef, but, until I receive his report, it is impossible for me to state what will be done. He has already been round the coast as far as Port Darwin for the purpose, and his report, when completed, will be comprehensive as to the coast as far round as Brisbane. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to have a definite statement from the Minister of Home Affairs with regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The honorable member for Darling Downs has drawn attention to the fact that the sum of  £22,500,  which we are asked to vote for the purpose, is practically for the building of the line. It commits Parliament to the total expenditure for the whole line. During the progress of a previous debate, the attention of the Minister was drawn to the fact that it was customary, before money was voted for railway works such as this, to give Parliament full particulars.

                        for the present year it is reported  that when the honorable member for Darling Downs - following up something that I had said a little while before - asked the Minister whether he would promise that before any appropriation was made by Parliament for this line he would lay upon the table of the House plans, sections, books of reference, and so on, the Minister of Home Affairs said, " We will give the fullest information." The Committee is entitled to that information before voting this money. Seeing that the survey has been completed a considerable time, I fail to see why the information has not been furnished. It surely could have been made available to honorable members. The Minister is ever priding himself upon, and impressing honorable members with, his great and undoubted business capacity. I put it to him, as a business man, whether he, in the conduct of his own business, when paying what was tantamount to a deposit on a contract which would involve him in an expenditure of £4,000,000, would not insist on knowing what the terms of the contract were? Surely his business instincts will tell him that that is merely a reasonable proposition to put ' before business men?

                            <para>- That is another point as to which we are entirely in the dark. We are entitled to a full statement of the policy of the Government. What are they going to do? How do they propose to construct the line - by day labour, or by contract? Is purely Australian manufactured material to be employed in the construction of the railway? We ought to have a quantity of information on these points. What the Minister has already said, we knew before. We knew from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> report that the money was simply for preliminary work. But what we did not know, and what we still want to know, is the policy of the Government. We want to have some idea of the way in which the line is going to be built. That information should be furnished before we vote this money. The same remarks apply - perhaps to a fuller extent - to money voted for purposes of the Federal Capital site. I had an opportunity, of which I availed myself recently, of visiting Yass-Canberra. For my own part, I can say that I am very glad indeed that the amendment with regard to that matter was negatived on Friday last. </para>

                            <para>- I was informed by those who have been at Yass-Canberra frequently that it was looking even better six months ago. My point now is, however, that the matter under discussion is not being dealt with by the Minister of Home Affairs in a business-like way. First of all, he comes down with no information as to the £.100,000. He made no attempt at an explanation, until it was absolutely dragged out of him, as to how much money was going to be involved in the work. Eventually we found out that by voting the amount proposed we were committing ourselves to an expenditure of £313,000. Before we proceed further with this undertaking, we should have from the Minister a full and clear statement as to the policy of the Government in that regard. We should be informed how the undertaking is to be financed. Indeed, the Minister should disclose the intentions of his Department, so that we may understand exactly what we are asked to commit ourselves to, because, as he admitted the other night, the  £313,000  to which we shall be committed by voting this item of £66,000 will be only a very small portion of the total outlay. In the future there must be an enormous expenditure in connexion with the Federal Capital ; and, therefore, I think that the Committee are entitled to a statement from the Minister as to the policy of the Government, and how it is proposed to finance this vast undertaking. Surely he does not intend to proceed from hand to mouth, taking a drib here and a drab there, and adopting a policy of utter drift, until he is committed to the expenditure of an enormous amount, without the faintest idea of where the money is to come from. Is that the position which he is taking up? Has he not any clear, definite idea of how the whole of this scheme is to be finally worked out ; and, if he has such an idea, will he not take the Committee into his confidence? Surely that is only a businesslike view to take. When we remember that we have not yet acquired a single foot of land in the Territory outside the grant from the State and the acquisition of Acton Estate, and that we will have to acquire an enormous area from private owners, it should make us pause. From what I saw of its character the other day, we are not going to get the land for nothing. It is carrying a sheep and a half to the acre over the greater portion of it. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but when we find fat rabbits and fat stock on a property, we have a better proposition still. I think that the general character of this country must be perfectly evident to every honorable member. I do not say that it is all of the same character, because it is not. It comprises very good hills ; some of them are remarkably good, while others are poor ; but the flats are very good indeed, and, with up-to-date farming, they will produce excellent results. </para>

                            <para>-We can see that in the next half-year we shall have to provide for an enormous expenditure. That is one of the reasons why I am trying to-night to impress on the Minister the necessity of taking the Committee into his confidence, especially as regards finance. The honorable member for Maribyrnong referred just now to what he called the Federal Capital " toy." It is my impression that it is possible to finance the Federal Capital scheme and make it pay for itself. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the whole scheme, if properly handled from the outset, can be made to finance itself ; and I should like to know how the Minister proposes to tackle the question. I ask for some definite information as to the particular scheme, if the Minister has one in view, as he must, seeing that he applauded my words in this connexion. I have a scheme in my own mind ; but I do not propose to weary honorable members with it to-night. It is not necessary to pledge the credit of Australia to any appreciable extent ; and yet, at the same time, it is possible to inaugurate a vigorous policy and carry out the work on proper lines. </para>

                        <para>.- We ought to have full particulars as to the cost of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. This is a big undertaking, of which I approve; and, as the Minister is a good business-like man, I know that he will not proceed unless everything is in proper order. My own opinion is, however, that there ought to be a Public Works Committee, or some body of that kind. Instead of proceeding with this railway as a scheme by itself, the Government ought to direct attention to the construction of a railway through the Northern Territory, which would pay from the start. This would be much better than developing a. territory belonging to other people. </para>

                            <para>- To Western Australia and South Australia; and it is land over which we have no control. There ought to be some definite scheme in regard to the Northern Territory ; and I dare say that, before long, the Minister of Home Affairs will tell us what he proposes to do. As to the Federal Capital site, I know something of land, and when I paid a visit of inspection, I saw nothing like what the honorable member for Richmond has described. He told us that the land at Yass-Canberra will carry one and a-half sheep to the acre. If that be so, I am glad to hear such good news, for, personally, I saw neither sheep nor cattle, and was told that they had all been sent to the mountains to wait for the grass to grow. The honorable member further told us that on the Federal Territory he saw fat rabbits, fat sheep, and fat cattle; but, if so, that is a sight which cannot be enjoyed in any other part of Australia. Fat sheep and fat rabbits do not flourish with one another, because fat rabbits mean that there are no fat sheep. We shall live to be ashamed of ourselves for spending money on this Capital site. As the honorable member for Echuca said, there ought to be a referendum on the question before another shilling is spent. The honorable member for Richmond said that he had a scheme by which the Federal Capital, could be made self-supporting; but I think it will be a dead loss from the start, and we cannot afford any loss at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- There is a vast difference between Yass-Canberra and the Macdonnell Ranges, which, we are told, can carry 20,000,000 sheep. It has a 15-inch rainfall, and most fertile land, suitable for the growing of wheat, and so forth. We should be better employed in developing the Northern Territory than in dealing with this miserable Capital site, which never was wanted and never will be. Surely we have sufficient capital cities in Australia already, with aggregations of population? I hope and trust that this Parliament will never spend anything on a Capital site, or any other scheme that is not self-supporting. I was much surprised to hear the honorable member for Richmond suggest that the Federal Territory would finance itself, for we know that he is a good business man, and understands Australia. The honorable member has not seen very many nice dairy farms in that country. </para>

                            <para>- The water will have to be taken a long way, and I think it could be taken on to better land. So far as I can see, the Yass-Canberra country is too porous for irrigation. I really wish the Minister would give us the benefit of what he really knows of the Yass-Canberra site. It is all very well to build a Military College there, because the site is far enough away from civilization, affords abundance of room for drilling, and plenty of rabbits for shooting practice. I hope honorable members will be very careful before they sanction any further expenditure, because all the money we have is required to develop Australia generally on proper lines. </para>

I thought that, as a man of the soil, the honorable member would have been able to give a better idea of the carrying capacity of the land at Yass-Canberra than his estimate of a sheep and a half to the acre. </para>

When I spoke against this particular site before, I said that I had not seen it, and quoted from the statements of Ministers and others who had visited the site. I can speak now from a personal knowledge of the country, which has more than confirmed me in the opinions I previously held concerning it. The honorable member for Richmond is anxious to know exactly how every item of the vote for the Federal Capital is to be expended. </para>

I should have been glad to have had the assistance of the financiers, and those who know something of land values ; but I found the honorable member for Richmond, and other honorable members, when they had the opportunity to prevent this expenditure, swinging in behind the Minister of Home Affairs. The honorable member for Richmond voted away £100,000 for expenditure on the Yass-Canberra site. Now he wishes to know exactly how that money is to be spent. </para>

                            <para>- With all the honorable member's shrewdness, he is following the old plan of locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen. The only lands that I saw at the Capital site which would be likely to carry a sheep and a half to the acre, were the alluvial flats on Molonglo Creek. Of the three estates which have been referred to, I should say that that on the road to the Murrumbidgee is the best. It is rather late in the day now  for  the honorable member for Richmond to complain about these particular items. There is another matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Opposition. They are accustomed to hold up their hands in horror whenever anything in the shape of a Socialistic proposal is submitted for consideration. But they have assisted to carry votes for expenditure on the Capital site; and, no doubt, will assist to pass further votes for the same purpose, although the money will be spent on the most Socialistic schemes that have ever been  carried  out in Australia. The Federal Territory, being our own, we can do as we like with  it,  unrestricted by the limitations  of  the Constitution, and without let  or  hindrance from the High Court  or  the State </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I am prepared honorably to abide by the compact in the Constitution. The bargain was made by New South Wales, and even New South Welshmen now admit that it was a bad bargain ; but, as it was definitely accepted in the Constitution, I am prepared to abide by it. Without desiring to be unduly severe upon the previous Parliament or the present Parliament, I must say that I think we have made a terribly bad bargain in selecting the Yass-Canberra site. I am sure that we cannot carry out there all the ideas which the Minister of Home Affairs has in his mind. If the honorable gentleman had to deal with a suitable site, I could quite understand some of the glowing language in which he has indulged. Notwithstanding the eulogy of the honorable member for Richmond, I question very much whether we shall ever be able, even with 1,000 square miles of territory, to make the Federal Capital pay for itself at Yass-Canberra. With good soil, good surroundings, and a good water supply, the financing of the proposal would be possible beyond dispute. In the circumstances, however, I think we shall find that, as the Yass-Canberra Capital site is a failure from a national stand-point, it will also be a failure from a financial stand-point. </para>

                        <para>.- I think the Minister of Home Affairs should give some answer to the question )ut by the honorable member for Rich.mond, as to. whether he proposes, before commencing the construction of the transcontinental railway, to lay the plans and specifications before Parliament. If the vote of £22,500 is tq cover purely preliminary work, and is not to be held as binding the Committee to particular plans or details, we need not discuss it further. Does the Minister propose to follow the usual procedure adopted elsewhere, and submit plans and specifications, or does he contemplate that we should appropriate, in all, £4,000,000 without any idea as to the plans and specifications upon which the railway is to be constructed ? It should be remembered that this will not be the only line which the Commonwealth will construct. The Minister must not think that we have any desire to embarrass him in this matter. </para>

It is a matter affecting the conduct of his Department, and it arises in the submission of his Estimates to the Committee. The honorable member for Maranoa will remember that the Prime Minister withdrew the appropriation clauses from the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Construction Bill. The question now is, whether the Minister of Home Affairs intends to submit plans and specifications to  Parliament before proceeding with the construction of the line? </para>

We should all be the better pleased if the plans and sections were now ready. We are eager that this work should be proceeded with at once, and deeply regret the long delay that has taken place already. No progress has been made during the past eighteen months, and, apparently, for the next eight months only preliminaries will be entered upon. </para>

                            <para>- I can quite believe that when the honorable gentleman entered office the first thing he said to his officers was : " I want to get on with the Western Australian railway. Prepare plans and sections, so that as soon as the work is authorized it can be commenced, and the line completed within three years." No doubt difficulties have since come in his way. It is important, however, that when making a commencement of this kind, we should have a statement of policy, and an indication of the procedure to be adopted. I hope that next year we shall be asked to consider proposals for railway development in the Northern Territory, and am sorry that there cannot now be laid before us a programme of railway construction for defence and development generally. I do not know that, having had the Minister's assurance, we need devote more attention to the item, but I should like some information regarding the item- </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Darling Downs forestalled me to a large extent in the re marks he made with regard to the transcontinental railway, but as he has put the position much better than I could have done I am not sorry that he has saved me the trouble. I am somewhat surprised, however, at one excuse that the Minister urged more than once with regard to the smallness of the proposed vote, when he asked whether it was to be expected that the Government would go on with work relating to the railway before the Bill had been passed. I did not expect the actual work of construction to be proceeded with beforehand, but the preparatory work might well have been pushed on to a much larger extent than it appears to have been. The Minister knew perfectly well that the Bill, providing for the construction of this railway, being a Government measure, was just as certain of being passed with the majority behind him, as it is certain that he himself will draw his salary next month. I am very much afraid that the smallness of the proposed vote is an indication that there is going to be a good deal 'of the " ca' canny " business about the construction of this railway. It is well understood that these Estimates are something in the nature of a forecast of the expenditure that will be required during the forthcoming year, and, that being so, I want to know what the Minister is going to do, or, rather, what he is going to refrain from doing, in connexion with this large and important work, since he is not asking for more than £19,000, by way of a new vote for the current financial year. I have not yet heard a satisfactory explanation, in view of the fact that the Government are pledged up to the hilt to construct the railway, and I hope that the Minister will avail himself of an early opportunity to take the Committee into his confidence and let us have proof that the Government are pushing on energetically with the work. I have now a small personal matter to bring before the Committee. I am not given to dealing with the " parish pump " aspect of Federal politics, but I am much surprised to find that the electorate of Perth,' which has, in many of its subdivisions, been clamouring for increased postal facilities, has not, with the exception of a revote of £56. been allotted a single farthing for the building of official post-offices. Post' offices are being built all over Western Australia, and it is very singular that the electorate of Perth, which includes all the suburbs of the capital city, should have been left out in the cold. </para>

                            <para>- We have promises of a great deal that will be done by this Government in connexion with the General Post Office in Perth, whilst a telephone exchange is also in process of erection there. But those works, necessary though they are, do not give the suburbs the postal facilities for which they are crying out. The suburban portions of Perth are as much entitled to have postal facilities as are the remoter parts of the State. There are, in particular, two suburbs in my electorate - West Leederville and North Perth - which are urgently in need of these postal facilities. I am sorry that the Postmaster-General is not present ; if he were he would bear out my assertion that those two suburbs have been asking for post-offices for several years, and have not yet succeeded in convincing the Government that there is any necessity for their construction. 1 shall expect the Minister to give some explanation, and, in the meantime, I ask him to make a note of my remarks, because I think we are entitled to know why the suburbs I have named have been allowed to remain so long without the postal facilities to which they are entitled. </para>

                        <para>.- The Committee are entitled to more information regarding the items under consideration. We are getting information from the Minister little by little regarding some very large items. He gave us an idea just now of what he proposed to do by interjecting with regard to the Federal Territory that " She is a bonzer when she is irrigated." I take it from that remark that part of the proposal is to "irrigate her." We spent about £38,000 on the Territory last year, and I suppose that amount has been increased by this time to about £50,000. It is too early yet to judge of the results, as a good deal of the money may have been sunk in preliminary works that do not show themselves ; but I must confess that there is very little result showing there at present. The Military College is certainly a credit to those who are responsible for the work done there. The item of £53,000 for Naval Barracks, &amp;c, is described as " towards cost." Will the Minister give the Committee some information as to what the total cost will be? We are committing ourselves to a work which may run us into many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and are going to work in a very expensive way. The Minister is making a serious mistake in purchasing land, which will cost the Department more than it would cost to put up the whole Naval College on Federal Territory at or near Jervis Bay. I notice, also, that there is some doubt in the mind of the Department as to where the railway to link up the Federal Capital with Yass is to be run. Perhaps the Minister can give us some idea on that point. When I was there the other day, I was told that it was to be run in a way which, to my mind, would so split up the site as to completely spoil it. It is unwise to run a railway through the heart of the magnificent city which, we are assured by the Minister, is going to be established there. There is another matter which needs the Minister's immediate attention. I understand that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has made urgent representations to the Minister and the Postmaster-General ' that arrangements should be made to enable the men working there to bank their money. There is a large number of men employed, and as there is no Savings Bank on the spot they are obliged to lose half a day to go to Queanbeyan to put their money into safety. Where a number of men are living in tents, it is not safe for them to have money lying about, or to carry it about with them. I am given to understand by those who are not directly interested in the matter that many of the men go into the town to put their money away safely, while some hang about the town and spend money  which otherwise they would not spend. This difficulty could be easily overcome if the Department would allow their man to go out there once a fortnight, collect the men's savings, and take them into Queanbeyan. A postal official from Queanbeyan visits the Territory once a fortnight now, and the men can purchase postal notes, but they cannot bank their money. It is altogether unfair that the men should be asked to pay 5s., and lose half a day, to go into Queanbeyan, or else run the risk of losing their savings. One of the workmen told me he was carrying £20 on him, and did not know what to do with it, as he was living in a tent. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that the Minister has given out to the world that he could run the earth if he were given a chance, I was rather disappointed that he was not running this little bit of the earth more on business lines than he is doing at present. I hope that by next pay-day the men will have some facilities for safely depositing their money. Many of the works done, or partly done, in the Territory are certainly creditable to the Minister or to the Department. The roads that have been laid down are well done. I think that where credit is due it should be given, and although very much does not appear to have been done with the £40,000 or £50,000 that has been spent, wherever permanent works have been put down they have been well done, and I congratulate the Minister on that, at any rate. I hope the Minister will shortly give us an estimate of what the total cost of the Naval and Military Colleges will be. If we vote £53,000 now, how much shall we have to vote in order to complete the Naval Barracks and other items specified? </para>

The Minister is such an authority on banking, and has had such a varied experience, that I should have thought one of the first things he would do would be to establish a bank, run on business lines, in the Federal Territory. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Moreton tells us of men who are carrying large sums of money about with them because they are unable to put it in a bank. It would cost a man 5s. to go down to Queanbeyan to hank his money, and that would represent interest on a comparatively large sum. That is not a business transaction. Is it a fair proposition to expect a man who is earning only a few shillings a day to have to pay 5s. a week to take his money to the bank? </para>

                            <para>- I will give the Minister a business tip free of charge. When railway construction works were in progress in Queensland, the Government arranged that when the men came up to the pay-table for their wages, a Government Savings Bank official stood alongside the pay clerk, and any man who wished to hand over a portion of his earnings to be banked could do so there and then. Why cannot we do the  same at Yass-Canberra ? </para>

                            <para>- Of course, it is. " Where there's a will, there's a way." If the Queensland Government could make such arrangements on its construction works, surely the Federal Government could do something of the same sort in connexion with its Federal Capital works. If the Government do not want to establish a Federal Savings Bank, why not ask the New South Wales Government to send a Savings Bank official there every pay-day ? </para>

                            <para>- No, it has nothing to do with the Treasury. It concerns the Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department. With regard to the Naval Barracks vote, surely the Government are not going to accept the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> money after the way in which our party opposed the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> proposal? As far as I am concerned, I am not going to be a party to the acceptance of one shilling of that money. We have Federal territory of our own at Jervis Bay, where we could easily establish a Naval College. Why not establish it there? I have seep it stated that when the Naval School was established at Dartmouth, in England, that place was selected because it was far removed from any large centre of population. For the same reason, I think that the Naval College should be established at Jervis Bay. </para>

We have not yet a building erected at which a Savings Bank could be located. If those who visited Yass-Canberra lately had gone down to the Acton Estate, they would have seen what we are doing there.

                        <para>.- I see an item of £2,500 towards the cost of constructing and altering lighthouses. I am very pleased that the Commonwealth is taking over the control of lighthouses, and I trust that, as a result of the transfer, parts of our coast which have been sadly neglected will be attended to. I notice that Commander Brewis has been sent to report on the Victorian coast to the east of Port Phillip, and I hope that the Minister will be prepared to allow that officer, when he returns from Tasmania, to report on the Victorian coast to the west of Port Phillip. The coast lying between Cape Otway and Warrnambool, and embraced in my electorate, is without a lighthouse. A steamer travelling between those two points loses sight of the lighthouse on the Warrnambool side a considerable time before it catches sight of the lighthouse at Cape Otway. It has been suggested that the Minister should have a report prepared with a view to seeing whether a lighthouse could not be established in the vicinity of Port Campbell. According to information I have received, eight wrecks have occurred on this coast within a distance of about 25 miles. I believe that every one of the wrecks, which resulted in considerable loss of life, could have been prevented had there been a lighthouse in the vicinity of Port Campbell. I refer to the wrecks of the <inline font-style="italic">Fiji, Marie Gabriel, Loch Ard, Napier, Newfield. Young Australia, Schomberg,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Falls of H attadale.</inline> I believe that a report, if prepared, will be favorable to the establishment of a lighthouse at Port Campbell. I trust that if a favorable report is received a lighthouse will be established as soon as possible in the interests of fishing men and mariners, because this is considered to be a most dangerous part of the coastline of Australia. I feel sure that the Minister will give early attention to my suggestion. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that any Minister, if allowed a free hand, could arrange this matter in the course of a few minutes. Another serious point to be considered is that when a large body of men are engaged on a public work, they are subjected to certain temptations when they go into a town, and a certain percentage will spend much more money there than they would do if they could bank their money for the use of their wives and children living in other parts of the State. Seeing that the welfare of 400 or 500 men and their families is affected, I hope that, before the item is passed, the Minister will give us a distinct assurance <inline font-style="italic">that,</inline> without further delay, some step will be taken by which men will be relieved from that which I think is a scandal. At the present time a man has to carry about with him £15 or £20, the same as was done on the diggings half a century ago, or he has to lose half a day's work, and pay a coach fare of 5s., in order to deposit a few pounds which he has been able to save. The savings of the men are not great, and in many cases wives and children are waiting for money. It is not proper that the present state of things should be allowed to continue. There is creeping into our Estimates a system which, I think, cannot be too strongly condemned. We are asked to vote £40,000 towards the cost of establishing a Military College, £100,000 towards the cost of establishing the Federal Capital, £22,500 towards the cost of constructing a transcontinental railway, and £1,000 towards the cost of erecting Commonwealth offices in London. From the manner in which the Estimates are framed, we cannot tell what any one of those public works is likely to cost. A far better plan would be to state in one column the total cost of a public work, and in an adjoining column the proportion of the cost to be expended in the. current financial year. Except in the case of two small items, we are asked to authorize public works without any information as <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> their total cost. All that we are told in each case is that the amount which is now asked is towards the " cost of construction." To the item of £2,000 towards the cost of constructing and altering lighthouses there is a footnote telling us that the total cost is estimated at £25,000, while to the item of £2,000 towards the cost of additional magazine for the storage of ammunition for field artillery there is a footnote telling us that the total cost is estimated at  £10,000.  In one case we are asked to vote now one-twelfth of the total estimated cost, and in the other one-fifth. Why could not a footnote be attached to each item, so that we could learn at a glance the total estimated cost of the public works? Take, for instance, the item of £22,500 towards the cost of constructing a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. We have not been told whether the Minister intends to carry out the work under the contract system or by day labour. If the work is to be carried out under the day-labour system, then the amount set down amounts to an absolute farce, for £22,000 would not provide a quarter of the plant required. It will be twelve months before we have another opportunity to deal with the Estimates, and the question is whether the Government intend to " hang up " this work for that time. The only conclusion we can come to is that there is no earnestness behind the proposal - that the Government do not intend going on with the work during the ensuing twelve months. If it is intended to carry out the work under the day-labour system, there will be required during the current year an expenditure of at least  £250,000;  and even that sum would not, I think, prove sufficient. In this the Government are treating neither honorable members nor the Committee fairly. There ought not to be, and I do not believe there is, any intention at concealment in the mind of the Minister, who has been quite frank ; but the complaint is that we are asked to pass these items without the slightest information. I hope this is the last time honorable members will accept items of this kind, with a small amount set down, and an intimation that it is a contribution towards an ultimate expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- The only condition under which the Minister of Home Affairs would have been entitled or persuaded, if I may say so, to make a statement, would be at the instance of the Post and Telegraph Department, to the effect that facilities would be provided for the general public. In my capacity as Postmaster-General I may say that, where there is any desire on the part of the public to realize the responsibilities of dark days, and to put a few shillings in the Savings Bank, that desire will be met and encouraged by the Government. If there is any indication of any possibility of business in the Federal Capital Territory to justify the establishment of a branch of the Savings Bank, a branch will be established. </para>

I shall, however, make inquiries ; and I repeat that all possible facilities will be given to the workmen to deposit their savings. As to the Naval College, I may, in the absence of the honorable member for Adelaide, and as the Minister who represented the Minister of Defence for a number of months, inform honorable members as to the position. There was a most extraordinary agitation in Australia some little time ago, caused, I believe, by a belief on the part of some people that the British Empire was in peril, and a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund was established. A number of us did not believe that the Empire was in such desperate straits as depicted; but a number of patriotic citizens subscribed, I believe, about £43,000 to form the nucleus of what was ultimately intended to be a fund of £1,750,000 wherewith to present a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member desires to take the floor, I shall be glad to give way to him. I speak of a position that was reached as the result, if honor- able members please, of a political agitation. £43,000 was realized, and the question arose as to whether that money was to be returned to the subscribers or devoted in some other way to the defence of the country. When that proposition was submitted the establishment of a naval college for Australia was admitted to be a necessity, and those responsible for the fund which had been collected handed over the money subscribed for that purpose. It was accepted by the Minister of Defence, and the site for the College was selected in the vicinity of Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Right to the end. But we should get away from this dialogue. It is admitted, on the advice of our Naval experts, that we must have a naval college. The question arises : Are we going to take advantage of the offer of  £43,000  to be made available in the establishment of a college for the training of persons who will subsequently be drafted into our Navy for the defence of the country? Whether the College is established at Middle Head, in Sydney Harbor, or at some other site, the necessity for it is immediate. Its establishment is not dependent upon a view which might subsequently be held as to the suitability of Jervis Bay or any other place for the purpose. It must be undertaken at this particular time. The Government, under the advice of, I may be pardoned for saying, the most distinguished Minister of Defence who has occupied that position in the Commonwealth, propose to establish the College at the. site which has been chosen. </para>

We have been obliged by necessity to establish the Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong, the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and our Woollen and Saddlery Factory in other localities. We have not yet been able to initiate a concrete scheme for the establishment of all our factories in Commonwealth Territory. The view advanced by honorable members opposite apparently is that we should not establish a naval college outside of Federal Territory. </para>

                        <para>.- I stand aghast at the admissions and disclosures made by Ministers this evening. They were asked that certain facilities should be afforded to the men working in the Federal Territory, and I expected to be told that the matter would be immediately rectified, but instead of that statement we got a general account of the difficulties which the Department of Home Affairs has to face, the question of banking generally was dealt with, and the main issue was ignored. This Labour Government, which I have supported through thick and thin from the beginning, wobbles along behind its predecessors. At the camps where men are employed under the State Government, facilities are given for the payment of wages into savings banks. On the railway works, in the Buffalo, the paymaster makes provision for that. What was there to prevent the Minister of Home Affairs from telling us that the same thing would be done in the Federal Territory? </para>

                            <para>- I take it that what we ask for will be done wherever bodies of workmen are employed.  1  have no wish to inconvenience the Government, which I support, but I have always understood that the Military College and the Naval College would be established in Federal Territory. I thought that the Naval College was to be. at Jervis Bay, and in communication with the Military College ; although there is no statement to that effect on the Estimates, I assumed that that was intended. The Postmaster-General has told us that certain persons subscribed £40,000 towards the construction of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro asked if they made it a condition to handing the money over' to the Government that it was to be spent on a naval college to be established at Port Hacking. The Minister did not say that there was such a condition. If there was not such a condition, there was no reason for referring to the fund at all. If there was such a condition, it is outrageous that, to become the recipient of a miserable £40,000, the Government should set aside the policy recommended by its naval, and military advisers. . </para>

                        <para>. - 1  will explain the matter to the honorable member. A. body of Sydney citizens controlling a fund subscribed to provide for the purchase of a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> found themselves unable to carry out the original, object of the fund, and then intimated that they were prepared to present to the Minister of Defence the sum of, I think £43,000 to assist in the defence of this country, and so to assist in the defence of the Empire. The Minister, to the best of my knowledge and" belief, appointed a Committee to select the most suitable site on which to establish a naval college to train the youth of Australia, who are ultimately to be drafted into the Australian Navy. The Committee selected a site, the sum of £43,000 was made available, and we now submit an item to give effect to the proposal in order that we may have the officers and men necessary for our Navy. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister, having dealt with my first objection, I desire now to state that I distinctly object to being misled, and to a policy of fraud upon myself and other honorable members. I do not know whether other honorable members object, but I certainly do. I support the Government on its general policy, but I object to giving a vote on false pretences, or, in other words, to voting for the establishment of a naval college, believing that it is to be erected in some place other than that at which I now learn it is to be established. But for certain statements made on one side of the Committee, and the explanation made in reply by the Minister, honorable members would have voted for this item, believing that the College was to be established on Jervis Bay. There is nothing in the Estimates to show that it is not to be established there. We should not be called upon to vote for an item of £53,000 in respect of an undertaking of this character, without being taken into the confidence of those who are asking us to vote for it. It is evident from what has been said that the donors of this sum of £43,000 clearly laid down the conditions upon which it was to be handed over to the Federal Government, and that the Government, in order to secure that amount, have accepted a site of which they did not originally approve. If the Federal Territory is to be of any value, it ought to be developed. If there was any justification for the establishment of a military college at Yass-Canberra, then all the arguments advanced by the Ministry in favour of its location there must apply equally to the establishment of the Naval College within Federal Territory. I propose to support the amendment, first of all, because I object to the explanation given; secondly, because I consider that very important facts have been hidden from the Committee; and, thirdly, because I do not believe that the supporters of the Government have been honestly dealt with in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- No ; he has not, and it would be most injudicious to say definitely what was going to be done in regard to these propositions if he had them. There are a Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot, Naval Gunnery and Torpedo School, Naval Training School, Naval Boys' Training School, and Naval Midshipmen's College. The whole of those necessities are heaped under the vote of £53,000. I am very sorry, but I have tried to get hold of the Minister of Defence in order to obtain the particulars of each of those items. I think honorable members might reasonably assume that this is a vote which is intended to carry out the defence scheme of naval instruction for boys to fit them to go into the Australian Navy. I think honorable members might also assume that the Government have taken all reasonable precautions to see that the site most suitable and most advantageous has been picked in order to secure the best results. I would ask the honorable member, on the strength of the statement that has been made to him, to allow this item to pass without forcing it to a vote. </para>

In the first place, he attacked us for having a " <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> policy," but we have the satisfaction of knowing that, not only was the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> accepted, but the whole of the Naval Unit, including a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought,</inline> was accepted.

                            <para>- My statement is correct, but I do not wish to raise that issue now. The Minister raised all these issues, which we do not want to discuss. All we said was that this item was a large one, and that a whole series of matters was grouped together in it. We simply asked the Minister two questions - What was the extent of the commitment, and what were the items upon which we were voting? We made no charge of incompetence against any Minister or other person. In fact, anything we said would not be in the way of an attack upon the Minister of Defence. We simply wanted information to which we were entitled. The question asked  by  the honorable member for Eden-Monaro and the honorable member for Bourke, as to whether the sum of  £43,000  influenced the Government in any way in fixing upon the site- </para>

                            <para>- I accept the Minister's assurance without the slightest hesitation. At the same time, the question was very natural, because the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who is a very close student of the parliamentary papers, probably remembered that, on the  18th  November,  1909,  the House ordered a letter to be printed. I presume the question was based upon that letter, which was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> Taylor, Lord Mayor of Sydney, to the Government, offering a sum of between  £35,000  and  £40,000- to be used by your Government or this Committee </para>

                            <para>- I do not care where the site is so long as the expert recommends it as being the best. I would say, " Put the Naval College on a site in the electorate of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, if that is the best site." The policy of this House in this matter should be to put aside all external considerations, and be guided solely by the question of which is the best site for the efficiency of the Navy. Unfortunately, the papers regarding the recommendations as to the site have not been laid upon the table of the House. They may be confidential documents, and, if they are, and the Minister says that the expert have recommended the site, I would not raise another word against it. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister says not. Honorable members must not be too rash... Subsequent negotiations removing those conditions may have taken place. When citizens are patriotic enough to offer the Government large sums of money for public purposes, the Government ought to accept' the offer readily and willingly. But no; conditions which would be contrary to the. advice of the experts ought to be imposed. The honorable member for Bourke raised the subject in a very quiet, dispassionate, and well-reasoned speech. He made a fair, request, and I am sure he did not put his question with any desire to embarrass the, Minister, nor should the Minister think that we desire to embarrass him. </para>

The question I asked was fair, and it is no answer for a Minister to say that, because an Acting Minister is absent, he is not able to give the information. When these items are brought down, the necessary information should be in the hands of the Minister in charge. Is this vote in addition to ' the  £43,000  which is to be handed over to the Commonwealth ? </para>

Every shilling that we vote can be expended on purchasing land, where it is exceedingly dear. It is not fair to this Committee to propose to establish this College and. these buildings on land which has to be bought on certain conditions, when we are not told how much money is to be spent on the land alone. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said a little while ago, " to the best of my belief." I agree with the honorable member for Bourke that these buildings, which will be of a' permanent character, should be within Federal Territory. We. have taken over an enormous area of land for Federal purposes. Is it reasonable that we should, spend money on establishing a Federal institution elsewhere ? We can have the land at Jervis Bay for nothing. Why spend money on purchasing land elsewhere? It. is one of the most unbusiness-like proposals ever put before an Australian Parliament. Those who know Jervis Bay are aware that it is one of the best harbors in Australia. Moreover, in the interests of the cadets: themselves, it would be better that they should not be trained in the immediate vicinity of a large city. Every argument used in favour of establishing the Military College at Duntroon can be used with still more force in regard to the Naval College. </para>

                            <para>- Because if it be in the best interests of the military cadets and of the country that they should be trained at a college distant from one of the large cities, it will be equally advantageous ; that the naval cadets should be trained at a college that is not in the vicinity of Sydney. I believe that the first expert opinion furnished to the Government was avoidable to the establishment of the Naval College at Jervis Bay: . But for some reason or other that proposal was turned down. If we pass this vote, we shall commit the Commonwealth for all time to the establishment of the Naval College in the vicinity of Sydney. We shall make a mistake by so doing. Ministers would be wise to reconsider, their decision, and to determine to establish the College in Federal Territory, and in a situation where the students may be removed from such temptations as exist in the vicinity of Sydney. </para>
