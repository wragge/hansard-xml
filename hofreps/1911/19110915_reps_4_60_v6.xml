                        <para>- As I fear that a military caste is being created in the Commonwealth, I direct the attention of the two Ministers concerned to the report that the authorities of the Military College at Duntroon have refused to have anything to do, either socially or in their games, with the officers of the Department of Home Affairs. I ask is this statement true? </para>

If so, will he issue the instruction that all members of the Public Service shall be addressed by their civil, and not by their military, titles ? Cases such as I refer to have come under my own notice. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the instruction has been issued that officers are to be addressed by their civil titles, but I hope that, in the interest of the dignity of the service, proper consideration will be shown by all officers to each other. One officer may not desire to have social relations with another, but in a Democracy, civility and courtesy should mark all intercourse, irrespective of position. </para>

In the case of Johnson , &#163;100 was lodged, the money being returned to him on his departure from Australia. Prize fighters are treated exactly like other people. </para>

                            <para>- Some time ago I attended a large meeting of telephone subscribers in Sydney, to which I made the statement that in many instances the delays complained of were really the fault of the subscribers. This was resented, it being contended that my information came from the departmental officers, who, of course, always supported the Department against the subscriber. I then offered, with a view of ascertaining definitely who was to blame, to allow the Lord Mayor of Sydney and the  chairman  of the Chamber of Commerce to appoint some one outside the Department to test the service, and make a report uninfluenced by departmental considerations. The gentleman appointed did excellent work, but was in no way under the Department, although we paid him for his time. I do not agree with all his recommendations. Subsequently I made a similar offer to the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and the  chairman  of the Chamber of Commerce here. The person appointed is paid by the Department, but he is absolutely free from departmental control and is not a public servant, so that his report cannot be in any way influenced by the Department. I left the whole matter entirely in the hands of the gentlemen I have named. They were free to give what instructions they liked about the report, and to withhold the findings of the gentleman they appointed, or to communicate them to the press, as they thought fit. The only connexion with the Department of the gentleman who is doing the work is that we pay him. </para>

                    <para>.- Last night when, by courtesy of the House, I was granted leave to continue my remarks, I had just finished with the tendency in all British Dominions towards closer united action, towards greater singleness of purpose, on those broad lines of consolidation which are affecting every stage of life in the world to-day, whether it be amongst peoples, enterprises, or in the sphere of industrial co-operation. But this new form of racial unionism - a term which I prefer to &#34;Imperial&#34; union - of course, has its blacklegs. My friends opposite will be delighted to admit that one of those blacklegs is to be found in the person of that somewhat mysterious journalist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead.</inline> That journalist endeavoured to fix on the Prime Minister of Australia certain views, which, although I am in Opposition - being an Australian first and an Oppositionist afterwards - I was delighted to see the Prime Minister able to contradict immediately and emphatically. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead,</inline> who holds the views which he tried to fasten on the Prime Minister, is a blackleg in the matter of racial unionism. That will be readily confessed; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> is a blackleg for holding such views, other persons who support them, are likewise blacklegs. We find those blacklegs spread about the Empire, and they make it necessary to enunciate reasons why their views are against the interests of our race wherever it may be situated. In South Africa a prominent Dutch organ, the <inline font-style="italic">Volksstem,</inline> expressed similar views. It held that a Dominion was empowered to be neutral in any struggle in which the Empire was involved, and in certain contingencies ought  to exercise its right - that was the general tendency of the article. Although it is only a year or two since General Botha was fighting against the Empire, he saw how foolish this idea is, and how much against the interests of South Africa, and he gave, through his private secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bok,</inline> an emphatic contradiction to the sentiment, in the following terms in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the 28th July last - </para>

                    <para>I am authorized to say that General Botha has endeavoured to state as clearly and as unambiguously as possible the fact that he does not agree with the <inline font-style="italic">Volksstem</inline> article, and that he considers that for South Africa or for any other Dominion to be neutral while the Mother Country is at war is an impossibility. There can be no question of optional neutrality. In making this statement General Botha did so without any reservation whatever. </para>

                <para class="block">So we have the latest recruit to the Imperial family repudiating the sentiment as emphatically - in fact, more unambiguously than did our Prime Minister in his indignant repudiation of the Stead article. </para>
                <para>That African journal is one of the blacklegs against Imperial unionism. Another blackleg is nearer home, namely, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> which is of some importance as not merely the private property of the journalists or others who run it, but as the property of a great organization. </para>

                <para class="block">There we have unqualified support for the view alleged to have been put forward by the Prime Minister - support from the official organ &#39;of the Australian Workers Union, and also, I believe of the Commonwealth Labour party. What does that paper say of persons who do not hold such-views? It describes them as &#34; grinders of the faces of the poor,&#34; &#34;rack-renting landlords,&#34; &#34;price-raising monopolists,&#34; &#34;gaolers of unionists,&#34; &#34; pamperers of blacklegs,&#34; &#34; shooters down of the Empire&#39;s toilers, struggling for decent conditions of life.&#34; Which of these particular descriptions applies to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, or to the Attorney-General ? Is the Attorney-General or the Prime Minister a &#34; grinder of the faces of the poor &#34;? Is the Attorney-General &#34; a rack-renting landlord &#34; ? Is either of them a &#34; price-raising monopolist &#34; ? Is the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, even in the opinion of Peter Bowling - apart from my honorable friends opposite - a &#34; gaoler of unionists &#34; ? Are these men &#34; shooters down of the Empire&#39;s toilers, struggling for decent conditions of life&#34; ? I quote these phrases in order to show that, although those responsible for the conduct of the country&#39;s affairs at present may be above suspicion - although we are anxious and ready to accept any assurance they may make on this score - it is necessary for us to watch with the utmost care this &#34; scab &#34; tendency in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> and similar journals, so that the interests of our people, which are bound up with the interests of our race throughout the world, are not taken from the true path of national safety by this propaganda and gospel of disunion and chaos. I think I have said enough to show that it is still necessary for those who aspire to be leaders of thought in Australia - and I hope every honorable member includes himself in that category - to watch this &#34; snake in the grass &#34; that is appearing in journalistic utterances, and &#34; scotch &#34; it before it does much damage to the national cohesion of the people to which we belong;. </para>
                <para>I dealt last night with an excellent thing that happened in the Conference - the taking of the Dominions into the confidence of the Imperial Government in foreign affairs. That was, of course, something for which our delegates are not responsible; but I have no quarrel on that score, because it is a good move, deserving of welcome. Another good thing which occurred at the time of the Conference, though not in it, was the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance; and I hope honorable members will bear with me for a few moments while I make one or two observations regarding it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to ask that question, because I am confident that, if our Ministers had taken any active part in the renewal of the alliance, they would naturally have felt a certain amount of pride, and have published their participation to the world. This renewed alliance insures, so far as it is possible for an alliance to insure, peace within the regions of the Pacific. It also gives Australians fruitful cause for a certain amount of deep thought. On the surface it might be held, and in some quarters it is held, that there are inevitable causes of friction between the Empire of Japan and the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand. Those causes mainly attach to the alleged need for the territorial expansion of the Japanese Empire. It is known to close observers that of recent years Japan has been finding out that the territory in Asia, for which she waged two wars, is of no use for racial expansion. The Japanese have got control of Manchuria, and possession of Korea, but they find that these two countries have cheaper forms of labour than are to be found in Japan. The Japanese labourer and the Japanese agriculturist have found that in Manchuria and Korea they cannot get conditions equal to those they enjoy in Japan. </para>

                        <para>- It is an object-lesson we can understand, because we know its application in Australia. It is a lesson which I hope will make Japan realize the ground on which we frame our exclusion laws, and feel that we intend no insult to them when we feel it necessary to take steps for the protection of our labour, and of the sense of pride in labour which is the basis of a country&#39;s industrial activities and greatness. While it is to be hoped that Japan&#39;s experience in Manchuria will make the Japanese realize our necessities, I trust that some of those newspapers, to which I have referred in another connexion, will see the public polity, at any rate, of ceasing from that campaign of slander and calumny against a great people, which has disfigured them. In every newspaper of that character during the last few years the people of our northern ally have been held up to ridicule, contempt, and hatred. They have been held up as people to be infinitely despised, if infinitely feared. Such language cannot be adopted in regard to a proud people - who are a great power, and can boast a civilization older than our own - without causing trouble. It is necessary for the protection of our workers, and the maintenance of our national existence, that we should do what we can to build up Australia as a white buttress to the strength of the race to which we belong. But let us do that as gentlemen. Let us do it without insulting those with whom our interests are in this respect in conflict. Let us try to evolve, out of this apparent conflict of interests, some <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> which will insure the people of Australasia working in harmony, if possible, with the people of Japan, for the mutual development of our respective spheres of influence, so that the Pacific will remain what its name denotes - an ocean of peace, and not, as it may become, a theatre of racial discord. </para>

                        <para>- The Declaration of London is one of the matters which our delegates had to handle. What they themselves did not originate in the Conference turned out excellently. What they endeavoured to handle I am afraid they handled badly. The Declaration of London secured their concern mainly for two reasons. In the first place, the present Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister of Australia, had protester! against the  Declaration of London when it was first mooted some two years ago. Our delegates took up one side of his protest and dallied with the other. They went to London and protested against this Declaration being entered into before we had been consulted - a perfectly proper attitude to take up, in my opinion, in view of its immense interest to us - while they further pointed out that it was wrong, and dangerous, in certain particulars, to our safety. I only regret that whilst putting the first view with considerable weight, they allowed themselves more or less to be bluffed out of their second position by a Government which was fighting with its back to the wall against the almost unanimous voice of the Navy, and was also supported by other Dominions on various grounds which did not apply with equal force to the Commonwealth. For instance, our delegates were mainly concerned about the safety of Australian food supplies for the Mother Country in time of war. It was pointed out by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as is shown in the Conference reports, that our foodstuffs in time of war would be safer under the Declaration than they would be without it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey said that under the Declaration, which merely affects neutral shipping - it does not affect our own shipping - our position with regard to neutral shipping would be better than it would be without it, because any goods shipped in neutral bottoms in time of war to a neutral port could not be touched, even if it were known that the eventual destination of those goods was a country at war. He said that all we had to do was to ship our goods to some port in a neutral country near England, whence they could be shipped to the Mother Country, and that if the Mother Country&#39;s fleet could not guarantee the keeping open of the English Channel, then the war would be over so far as we were concerned.  His  latter statement was quite right, but his general argument, in my humble opinion, was wrong. In the first place, if we sent food supplies, say, to France to be shipped over to England, what sort of freights would the French railways charge upon such produce, knowing that they provided the only means by which it could be carried to a point close to the English coast? We know what happened in this community of ours, where we have almost identically the same interests - where the people of all the States are of the same flesh and blood - at the time of the great drought. Were the farmers in one part of Australia who had been blessed with beneficent seasons prepared to allow fodder - even from our cousins in New Zealand - to come in free to save the starving stocks of New South Wales and Queensland? </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so, but was that position acted upon? No. The principle of human nature applied. Those who had enjoyed good seasons felt that the bad times that had overcome their less fortunate co-workers offered them their great opportunity, and they demanded the highest price they could get for fodder they were supplying. That being so, what price would France ask for sending our goods across her territory in order that they might be shipped to England, knowing that in that way only could we hope to see them reach their destination? For this reason I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey&#39;s argument falls to the ground. </para>

                <para>I should like to show that we would not be in the same position without the Declaration as we are with it. Without the Declaration, we had the power of retaliation. With the Declaration we have bonded ourselves out of that power of retaliation. Take, for instance, the position of that great European Power which is now, for spectacular purposes, in its army&#39;s manoeuvres, making an onslaught on an imaginary British invading army. Germany must import raw materials to keep the artisans of Westphalia employed, and it imports these principally through Antwerp, which is the natural port of industrial Germany. Under the Declaration, any goods consigned to the German industrial provinces necessary to enable the German workers there to earn a living could be shipped in neutral bottoms to Antwerp, and could not be touched by any British warship, however supreme we might be, since Antwerp is a neutral port. </para>

                        <para>- It is. And it happens internationally to be a neutral port, so that these goods could not be touched by British ships upon the seas. Under the Declaration they would be absolutely immune from seizure. The more we go into the matter - and this I believe is why only the official sailors were in favour of the ratification of the Declaration - the clearer it is that we have bonded ourselves out of the great power of retaliation. We have given away our opportunity to do harm to an enemy in order that our position as neutrals may be made a little more secure. I think the reason for entering into the ratification of the document lies in the fact that the members of the present Government of Great Britain are largely lawyers. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey is a man with a legal temperament; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> is a lawyer, and Lloyd George, perhaps the greatest of them all, is also a lawyer. Law, whether real or international, is to them a fetish. These men were greatly alarmed by the complications which threatened the Mother Country during the progress of the Russo- Japanese war when British ships were sunk in the Red Sea by the semi-privateers of Russia. So afraid were they as neutrals of being drawn into international complications in the defence of British trade that to benefit their position as neutrals they seem to have sold our position as belligerents. Another question of vital importance to Australia, and to humanity at large, in connexion with this Declaration, is the unfortunate reception which was extended to the British Government&#39;s proposal that privateering and piracy in time of war, by converting merchantmen into war vessels, should be declared illegal by international law. That was one of the matters brought forward by the British Government. </para>

                        <para>- It should have been. Who opposed this principle? The Empire of Germany. The fact appears in the Conference reports. Germany opposed the principle, although Germany on land will shoot as an outlaw any man, seeking to defend his own country, if he does not belong to the regular forces of that country. In France the franc-tireurs were shot - some of them were hanged - for taking up arms in the defence of the country to which they belonged. They did not belong to the regular forces of France, and Germany therefore claimed to treat them as outlaws. Yet, when the master of a merchant ship, having enjoyed hospitality and commerce with the people of another nation, receives a wireless message upon the seas that war has been declared, Germany has so arranged it that he can haul guns and ammunition out of the ship&#39;s hold, mount them upon the gun platforms already provided, and start to prey upon the commerce of the people with whom he has been in friendly relations perhaps only an hour or two before. This is one of the things that has come out of the Declaration of London. </para>

                        <para>- It is one of the things for which no provision is made in the Declaration of London. The honorable gentleman is now taking the same view that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey took of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey said, &#34; We tried to get it, but we did not succeed. We have consequently accepted a document as a basis of international law which contains no such provision, but it does not alter the position. We are merely as we were.&#34; As a matter of fact, however, does not&#39; a man who enters into an agreement from which has been excluded a great principle for which he has sought in vain, weaken his case for afterwards securing the recognition of that principle? And since Great Britain asked for this provision against privateering and piracy, and accepted the Declaration, although its request was not granted, she has made our position infinitely weaker that it was for dealing with this great menace, not only to our interests, but to humanity at large. She has made our position infinitely weaker by tacitly permitting to come into existence a state of affairs which will lead to wholesale piracy on the high seas during the next great international struggle, while contracting ourselves out of our power to retaliate in other directions. This is a very important matter, and whilst I cannot traverse the whole subject, I think I have said sufficient to show that I have grounds, at any rate, for believing that a very serious step in the wrong direction has been taken by agreeing to the ratification of the Declaration of London. </para>

                <para>I do not think that I made myself quite so clear when I said that the interests of the other Dominions were not the same as our own. As a matter of fact, the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey with regard to the neutral port - the fallacy of which I have exposed as far as Australia is concerned - carried more weight with Canada than with South Africa. South Africa held the view that all she had to do in order to get her supplies to England was to send them through Portuguese territory lying immediately to the north and east of the Transvaal. Thus the natural port of the Transvaal was in time of war to be the port of South Africa, and South African trade was to be absolutely free and safe. Canada, with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier sitting on the rail, took up exactly the same attitude, thinking that they could trade through the United States. </para>

                <para>The question of the Declaration of London was one which was worth fighting thoroughly if it was worth fighting at all, but our delegates did not do so. The Minister of External Affairs did what he could, but he got a very poor start off. The Prime Minister introduced the subject to the Imperial Conference in an almost apologetic manner, which seemed to suggest that some influences might have been at work even before the Conference met to discuss the subject. </para>

                        <para>- That is a point I wish to get at in a moment. The Prime Minister, in introducing the proposal, said that his reason for dealing with it was that the fact of the Declaration of London having been taken exception to had given a most suitable opportunity to discuss the question of consulting the Colonies before entering into treaties. Surely they had a more serious purpose than that in bringing before the Conference the question of the Declaration? After all, people were fighting it in England and elsewhere. There were many influences at work against it. Countless high officers of the Navy and a number of members of Parliament on both sides of politics attacked it, and naturally expected that, when Australia put the matter down for discussion at the Conference, it was to be seriously discussed, and that grounds were to be brought forward to show why it should not be ratified. What must they have thought when they found the Australian Prime Minister saying that he merely took advantage of the opposition to the Declaration in England to advertise some other matter, which, although vitally important, might still have been brought forward without jeopardizing the position of the opponents of the Declaration by first coming forward to oppose it, and then remaining lamely to acquiesce in it? The Prime Minister said at the Conference - </para>

                    <para>As to the details, the second part of the resolution is important enough. We felt at the time that Article 24 was hardly defensible, and that Articles 48 to 54 would seriously damage the prestige of the British people and Governments; but that is a matter we do not wish to dogmatise upon at the present moment. </para>

                <para class="block">What had occurred between the time when the honorable member held the view that the Declaration was a very serious menace to our security and his arrival at the Conference, where he found it was not a matter upon which he wished to dogmatize? What views had been placed before him that do not appear in the public records? I think that is information which might be given to us if it is consistent with public safety, and I presume it would be, relating as it does to a matter which is, after all, only a question of international law, and not of actual preparations to meet a foe. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friends seem to forget that the greatest argument that has been brought forward in favour of the Declaration is really the strongest argument that exists against it. It is urged by its supporters that, without it, naval war would be chaos. That, I believe, is the strongest reason why we should oppose its ratification, because chaos is the opportunity of the strong, and if we are the strong upon the seas chaos is our opportunity. I do not think we would abuse that opportunity, because our history shows that we wage war temperately and humanely ; but at any rate it would be our opportunity to see that nobody used that chaos unfairly towards us, and it is unfortunate that the predominant strength of the British upon the seas, a strength which now exists even if it is fast disappearing, should be jeopardized by binding our hands with an international agreement with, primarily, our great competitor, who has kept no single treaty since the Treaty of Berlin, with the exception of that of the Triple Alliance. </para>

                <para>Let me now return to Australia, leaving the great things in which Ministers were interested while in England. When I left Australia, the ship in which I travelled had a wireless telegraphic apparatus, but the Commonwealth of Australia had none, although a year and a half previously the Parliament had declared its immediate intention of establishing installations. On my return to Australia I found exactly the same state of affairs. I thought it would be a good thing to get official information of the causes of the delay, and by the courtesy of the Postmaster-General I have been permitted to roam through the papers. They are somewhat interesting, and if honorable members will bear with me I shall endeavour to explain to them the cause of this extraordinary delay. </para>

This House passed, on 9th September, 1909, a resolution in favour of the immediate installation of wireless telegraphy around the coasts of Australia. Tenders were called for on 23rd October, 1909, about a month and a half later, so that reasonable expedition was used up to that point. On the 25th February, 1910, the Australian Wireless Limited submitted tenders, which were accepted by the Australian Government. </para>

                        <para>- By the previous Government; but if the honorable member wishes to make it a question of Ministerial responsibility, I. shall make him ashamed of his Government before I have done with the subject. The tender of Australian Wireless Limited was accepted on 4th April r 1910 - by the previous Administration, who at that time were fighting about the country, and could not be in their offices - on condition that the syndicate should indemnify the Commonwealth against all claims for the infringement of patent rights. The syndicate consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Denison, and the proprietor of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> with some others. That guarantee of indemnity against the infringement of the patent rights of any other wireless concern was a far more important matter than the completion of the contract, because it might involve us in hundreds of thousands of pounds. Honorable members might say that the syndicate was well able to take that risk, because it is well known that the proprietor of the &#34; anti-fat &#34; paper, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> is one of the &#34; fattest &#34; men in Australia, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Denison is a man of substance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, he is one of the Dixsons in the Tobacco Trust. The syndicate wrote to the Department on the 4th April, 191 1 - under the present Administration, with King Josiah, and not King Quick, on the throne - asking for formal assent to a proposal to transfer the obligations of Australian Wireless Limited to the Australian &#39; Wireless Company Limited, a newly formed company waiting to be started in Sydney, with more than five times the share capital. What was done in this position by the business Administration about which we have heard so much? They apparently overlooked the main obligation of Australian Wireless Limited, composed as it was of specific men, who could be laid hands on at any moment to complete their obligations. After a lot of delay, the Government transferred the obligations of Australian Wireless to The Australian Wireless Company Limited. That company was then placed upon the share register in Sydney, and nobody knows whom we shall have to foreclose upon, if ever we are sued for the infringement of patent rights. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I have here some extracts from the correspondence which took place when the Australian Wireless Limited asked permission to make the extraordinary transfer to which I have referred. It wrote on the 4th April, 1 91 1, and there is nothing on the file until its next letter of the 5th May, asking for an answer to that of the 4th April . This is the expeditious way in which this Department, which professes to be in such a violent hurry to get the wireless system installed, dealt with the business ! The Department wrote on the 10th May - five days after receiving the second letter which asked for a reply to the first - and said that inquiries were being made into the ability of the new company to perform the contract. The next document on the file is a telegram from the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales, dated the11th May, to this effect - </para>

                        <para>- The Government had been in office thirteen months ! The Australian Wireless Limited replied on the 11th May to the Department&#39;s letter of the 10th May, pointing out that its share capital would be about six times as strong as the previous capital - speaking from memory, about . &#163;30,000 instead of &#163;5,000 - whereupon the Postmaster-General, who professes to be a great opponent of stock jobbing, granted the transfer, and so enabled the syndicate to put its shares on the list of the Sydney Stock Exchange. By a stroke of the pen he enabled it to convert &#163;5,000 into &#163;30,000; he put the members of the syndicate into the position of being able to dispose of as many of the shares as they liked, and to get out of the business. He encouraged them to become rich at the expense of those who deal in share values on the Sydney Stock Exchange. I defy any honorable member to prove that that statement is wrong. </para>

                        <para>- When the first syndicate asked for permission to transfer its rights and obligations to the company, the Secretary to the Postmaster-General referred the matter to the Crown Law officers, who, after considering it with great seriousness, replied that it did not seem to be one for an opinion of law, but rather a case for the exercise of ordinary business prudence. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department should have realized that in the first place. The transference had nothing to do with the Crown Law authorities. But in the correspondence there is not one whisper regarding the important question of indemnity for an infringement of patent rights. </para>

                        <para>- I speak subject to correction, for I had not much time to look through the many papers, but I shall look into the matter again, not because I disbelieve the honorable member, but because I think that his recollection is at fault. How does he account for his readiness to enable the rich proprietors of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and others to convert ,&#163;5,000 into ,&#163;30,000, and thus become still more wealthy, by obtaining what may very properly be called &#34; unearned increment &#34; from investors on the Sydney Stock Exchange? If, as he now suggests, he thought the personal guarantee of the members of the syndicate more valuable to him than the guarantee of a company with a capital of ,&#163;30,000, why did he sanction the transfer? He should not have changed horses when crossing the stream, but should have held the tenderers to their contract. </para>

                        <para>- It always blames somebody ; but in the present instance, the Post and Telegraph officer made the design, and is charged with the responsibility. Then I have to ask the Postmaster-General what arrangements have been made for fencing in these stations, which may mean a large, or only a small sum. If the Postmaster-General will inquire from the Minister of Home Affairs, he will find that the responsibility for the delay rests purely and solely with his own Department; and it would Be more manly to confess the fact, and endeavour to make better progress in the future. I have here the share list quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> which proves that the company is on the share register of the Stock Exchange, New South Wales; and it would not have been placed there if the original shareholders were not prepared to sell their shares, and so place themselves on velvet - enabled to do so by the consideration and kindness shown to them by the Department. </para>

                        <para>- A share list is never placed on the Stock Exchange register unless those holding the shares are prepared ito deal in them ; and immediately this company, owing to the kindness of the Department, was enabled to increase their capital from, let us say, &#163;5,000 to &#163;30,000, the list was placed on the register. The holders of the shares could sell them, if at par, for &#163;30,000, and no doubt the members of the syndicate will then be very happy - somebody else, whom we do not know, being left to shoulder the responsibility. </para>

I quite agree that the Postmaster-General was not a conscious party to this arrangement, but it is owing to the absence o_f business knowledge and of practical <inline font-style="italic">common</inline> sense that this thing has occurred. Whether the honorable gentleman is responsible personally, in consequence of having himself supervised the matter, is not a question to canvass here, but it is very regrettable that the present position should have arisen. </para>

                        <para>- It is sufficiently serious to cause the Defence authorities to ask the Post and Telegraph Department to make sure, during the three months&#39; testing, that the stations are not used for improper purposes. If there are to be such provisions, we might at least make them apply to the &#34; boss&#34; as well as to the workmen. There is much that is amusing in connexion with this matter ; but there is only one other question I desire to put to the Postmaster-General. The contract, I may say, was very cleverly worded. The phrase &#34;in or near &#34; Sydney and Fremantle respectively, was altered to read &#34;at&#34; Sydney and Fremantle ; and this seems to have resulted in getting for the syndicate an extra  &#163;2,000  out of the Commonwealth for the installation. What I desire to refer to, however, is the covering letter to the contract containing the following - </para>

                <para class="block">I desire to know what portions of the plant, if any, have been manufactured in Australia. The bigger sections, including the mast and so forth, are, I understood, imported, and yet we have in this letter a solemn statement, which, morally, is an undertaking, but which at law would, of course, be valueless. None of the plant, perhaps, has been manufactured here; but no doubt this cunningly devised letter materially helped in obtaining the contract for&#39; this particular syndicate. </para>
                <para>When in England I took the trouble to make inquiries into the matter of investments in Australia, and, although it is impossible, in the absence of statistics, to obtain more than the opinions of those we meet, I found that capital, on balance, is absolutely ceasing to come towards this country. In the opinion of those best able to judge in the Mother Country, we are, on the balance, absolutely losing capital. For some years past we have enjoyed tremendously prosperous seasons. As the product of the soil repays the foreign mortgages upon the soil, so the money that is released leaves Australia to develop some other country. This fact is well worthy of the most earnest consideration of the Government. Vast amounts of money are leaving England for the Argentine and Canada, both trade rivals of the Commonwealth, whilst no money is leaving England for Australia. A new country, like a new selection, requires outside capital to develop it. Australia as yet is barely scratched, so far as her potentialities are concerned. A small population like ours needs capital to develop the country. We need capital to employ our citizens, as well as the new citizens whom we expect ; and unless we get it we shall fall still further behind Canada in the race for prosperity. I most earnestly suggest to my honorable friends opposite that they should have a serious inquiry amongst themselves as to the causes of this falling-off. </para>

                        <para>- Not a moment longer than it suits them. If they present those notes to the Commonwealth Treasury - notes which have been handed over the counter by the Australian people because they prefer gold - what will be the position? The banking returns at the end of this month, I believe, will show that of the total issue of  &#163;10,000,000  nearly &#163;6,000,000 worth are held in the banks, and that only some  &#163;4,000,000  worth of notes are in circulation. How would the Commonwealth &#34;Treasurer meet those &#163;6,000,000 worth of notes, held by the banks, if the latter chose to present them for payment? </para>

                        <para>- No, because they have a greater interest in national security and national credit than has the honorable member&#39;s party. If the Government are sound financiers: - if they are not mere quacks - they ought to be holding ample gold reserves in the Treasury to meet any possible contingency. As a matter of strict fact, taking the note issue on a broad basis as being  &#163;10,000,000,  the Government are holding some  &#163;4,750,000  in gold, whilst some &#163;6,000,000 in notes is being held by the banks. If the banks were not imbued with a finer patriotism than honorable members opposite show, they could present those notes, and the Treasury of the Commonwealth would be bankrupt. </para>

                        <para>- That statement is incorrect, and the honorable member ought to know, if he has inquired into the subject, that the Bank of England is the agent of the Imperial Government, and in return for the various agency operations that it transacts on behalf of the Government, is granted certain privileges. </para>

                <para>What I wish to impress upon my honorable friends opposite is that the principal reason for the drying up of our avenues for obtaining new capital from England lies in Government actions that have recently taken place in this community. No one can say that it is due to bad seasons, or to lack of inherent enterprise on the part of our most industrious people. It is due rather to the fact that this community has placed in the forefront of its legislation a placard to the world that we want no foreign capital for the development of Australia. We are taxing foreign capital as absentee capital. We are taxing it deliberately, and it is because honorable members opposite have taken that extraordinary, stupid, and narrow view of the requirements of Australian development, that we are getting no capital from abroad, whilst Canada and the Argentine are going ahead. </para>
                <para>In conclusion. I should like to say that, of all the wild-cat projects of my honorable friends opposite, none can do greater harm than their constant endeavour to stir up industrial unrest in Australia. I found, on returning from England, that the referenda had already borne fruit. I found that industries which before the referenda were peaceful, had become, by some mysterious means, centres of industrial unrest. Not outside, but inside, those industries that they wish to nationalize, honorable members opposite have succeeded in creating burning questions. In the sugar industry, the iron industry, and, indeed, in every industry regarding which Government action was desired, the Labour party have succeeded in stirring up unrest. </para>

If he does, I must refer him to the English speeches of the Prime Minister and other members of the Australian delegation, in order that he may see what I mean. Something more than ordinary trade union methods is being introduced by these gentlemen into what was the genuine trade unionism of some ten or fifteen years ago. Those persons who are trying to make of Australian industries a smouldering heap of ashes, are actually proposing what my honorable friend referred to as civil war. We all remember how honorable members opposite tried to laugh down the honorable member for North Sydney when he referred to the speeches of responsible Ministers. But what do we hear from responsible members of the party opposite - from men chosen for the highest opportunities within their party&#39;s gift? Here are the sentiments expressed by men who advocate that strikers should arm and shoot down those described as &#34; blacklegs.&#34; </para>

I certainly have before me a newspaper report of a certain speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and I am glad, sir, that you admit that it is correct. It appeared in this morning&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> admit that it is really a report of a speech made in the Senate yesterday. I shall endeavour, however, to take another means of placing it upon record. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> attitude has saved my honorable friends opposite from having to answer a very difficult question? </para>

                        <para>- When my honorable friends opposite go round the country - and I am not now referring to them as members of Parliament - advocating that persons should take by force what the law in common justice cannot give them, it is time they realized that they are on the brink of advocating civil war. I do not wish to see anything of the kind, and should&#39; personally endeavour to settle my differences with some one of my own weight, like the Attorney- General, if we were to come to such lengths. But I ask these honorable members, in the light of certain information from New South Wales, published in this morning&#39;s newspapers, whether they will grant others - those the wages of whose toil they are taking from them - the right to retaliate in kind if this: sort of thing goes on. They are holding up in New South Wales one of the principal sources of wealth in this community as a whole. They are holding up our wheat exports. The export of wheat is keeping vast bodies of the Australian people alive, and those with whom my honorable friends opposite are associating are stopping wheat from being shipped from Sydney. If the strikers in Sydney have a right to shoot any man who tries to get his wheat carried to market, have not the farmers of that wheat, who cannot sell it unless they can be guaranteed a market, a right to shoulder their rifles and to come down to see that their wheat is shipped? I put this to my honorable friends, not that I want to see such a state of affairs brought into existence, but because I want to show them that this foolish irresponsible nonsense on the part of professional politicians must, cease if we are to have peace, order, and good government in Australia. This country needs to do all that it can to prepare itself for the possibilities of the future. It does not want its house to be divided against itself. It needs orderly enterprise and orderly progress within its confines; it wants the privilege of the law accorded equally to every section of the community, and, what is more, it wants a halter for every person who goes round the country preaching the doctrine of civil war and advocating the use of arms by those who are engaged in the heat of party conflict or industrial disputes. </para>

                    <para>.- During my recent trip I passed through some of the islands of Fiji. It has been thought for many years past in Australia that that group of islands, owing to their proximity to this continent, ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth, or, at least, of New Zealand. Until the time of my visit I had very little idea of the danger of the development which is now going on. The Fijians themselves are a fine race of people - I suppose as fine a race of natives as could be found in any part of the world. The work of the missionary has been attended, in those islands with better results than in many other cases, but within recent years the sugar industry has been started there, with results which I propose to describe. Although the Fijian native works for comparatively small wages, he would not work for as small a wage as the sugar planter offers. These planters were strong enough to induce the British Government to allow them to import a certain class of people under indenture for the purpose of developing the industry in Fiji. The result has been most demoralizing to the people of the islands. There have- been brought in about 40,000 Hindoos of the worst type that it would be possible to find. They are the gathering up of the scum of all parts of India. Many of them, on their own admission, were criminals before they came to Fiji. They are brought in for a term of five years by the company, and during that period the. average wage received by the men is i:r..57d., or just under is. per day, while the average wage for the women, who also work in the fields, is 5.93d., or just under 6d. per day. If they do not complete the task that is set them they are brought before a Court and heavily fined, or imprisoned. In the year 1907 there were 1,460 cases of imprisonments and other penalties for non-completion of tasks. </para>

                        <para>- I could not give the details, but I know it is a fairly stiff task. The Hindoos are treated with the utmost severity. The overseers flog even women and children. The state of immorality at the place is so bestial that I could not attempt to describe it to the House. I have here a recently published book called <inline font-style="italic">Fiji Up 10 Date,</inline> by J. W. Burton. My own personal inquiries and information furnished me by business people and others during my short stay in Suva bear out exactly what is published in that book, from which I propose to read a few extracts. The author deals with the position of Fiji as the key to the Pacific, and shows also what we have already lost by our negligence in allowing other Powers to take other islands which will be of great strategic importance in relation to Australia at a later date. Already on one of the islands close to Suva there are some &#34;thousands of Japanese, and it is generally believed that in the near future the whole of the Fijian islands will become peopled by Indians of the worst type. The writer, who was on the islands for some time, says - </para>

                    <para>Back on the plantations the coolies are herded together like so many penned cattle, amid the most insanitary conditions and indescribable and disgusting filth. A man must hold his nose wilh a firm grip as he passes through some of these lines ; but to <inline font-style="italic">live in them-</inline> ! It is small wonder that sickness and disease hold carnival, and such places are a disgrace to civilization and a stain upon commerce. . . . One of the saddest and most depressing sights a man can behold, if he have any soul at all, is a &#34;coolie line&#34; in Fiji. There is a look of abjectness and misery on almost every face that haunts him. Dirt, filth, .and vile stenches abound. Wickedness  flaunts itself unshamedly. Loose, evil-faced women throw their jibes at criminal-looking men, or else quarrel with each other in high, strident voices, made emphatic by wild, angry gestures. The beholder turns away, striving to discover whether pity or disgust is uppermost in his mind. There is much occasion for both. Many of the coolies are of low caste, or no caste at all. The sweepings of the streets of Calcutta, the riff-raff from the .inland towns, the ne&#39;er-do-wells from the villages, and the men who have become too well known to the police - all are to be found in Fiji. </para>

                    <para>Morally, the Indian in Fiji is outside the decencies of description. The sins that brought clown fire on the Cities of the Plain are rampant. Bestiality, which would shame even a Pasiphae riots here. We dare not attempt to even hint at its vileness. No established marriage laws obtain. A woman will stay just as long with :\ man as it suits her. When a better husband appears who can give more jewellery, then she goes to him. A woman&#39;s family sometimes represents as many husbands as there are children. The girls commence a life of dishonour at a very early age. They may be married - that is, purchased by some man from their parents - at the age Of seven or eight. Then they are under the care of the, husband&#39;s people - if he has any. The guardians will sometimes try to get back as much of the money spent in the purchase as is possible by selling the child&#39;s virtue. When the little girl is twelve or thirteen she commences to live with her husband, who may be twenty or thirty years older. In a year&#39;s time she is a mother ! We have seen them mere children - with smaller children at their breast - <inline font-style="italic">mothers at twelve and thirteen! . . .</inline> To-day Indians are covering the face of Fiji. In several districts they already outnumber the Fijians. </para>

                <para>They are gradually pushing the native back by leasing or buying his best lands; and the river and road frontages are mostly theirs. They are changing the face of Fiji also. Everywhere their patches of cultivation appear. This month it is standing bush we see, the next month there are shoots of maize coming up between the stumps in the clearing. One may drive from Suva to Nausori, for example - 12 miles - and not see one solitary Fijian village till the very end of the journey. Indians, Indians, Indians, along every mile of the road. There seems only one prospect for Fiji - it is that of becoming an Indian colony. Whether or not this is an end to be desired, opinions vary. It is, however, seemingly inevitable. </para>
                <para class="block">I believe that in the interests of the future of the Commonwealth, an inquiry ought to be held into these allegations with the ultimate object of approaching the Imperial authorities and taking over the control of that group of islands. They are&#39; very rich, and the natives can be moulded into a very useful race, but if the demoralization now going on continues, it will be a bad look-out for them. There does not seem to be any falling-off in the importations. As a matter of fact, the Hindoos are increasing rapidly. Under the terms of the indenture, they are imported for five years. At the end of that term they are allowed to remain another five years, and if during that time they have not been imprisoned they arte allowed to remain for good. So that practically every person who has gone to Fiji to work on the sugar plantations will remain there permanently. This matter concerns us so materially, and will concern us so much more in the future, that the Government should inquire into it at the  earliest date, with a view to ultimately taking control of the islands. I think, too, that there should be a radical reform of the methods of advertising Australia abroad. I do not know what right the Company concerned has to give an imitation in London of the scenery and productions of Australia, such as that at the Festival of Empire at the Crystal Palace; but it is a disgrace to those responsible for it. The promoters approached the Commonwealth for a subsidy, which was refused, but they have erected a wattle and daub structure which they call a representation of the Federal parliamentary buildings ; and in connexion with what they term the &#34;all-red route railway&#34; have painted and arranged scenery which one might well think designed to wreak their vengeance upon this Government for refusing assistance. On the other hand, Canada and the Pacific Railway Company, which have been lavish with funds, are very differently treated, the Canadian scenery being most magnificent, .while there is a splendid display of Canadian productions. I cannot believe that the Commonwealth has not power to prevent a private company from thus traducing Australia. Our methods of advertising abroad are an absolute farce, whereas Canadian possibilities are advertised everywhere. In every important centre of the United Kingdom Canada has a representative from whom you can get information as to what she offers to settlers ; but if you want such information regarding Australia you must apply at the Commonwealth Offices, 72 Victoria-street, London. I am of opinion that we should have representatives in every important town of the United Kingdom, and also throughout Canada and the United States of America, where I am convinced there is a wonderful market for Australian productions. New Zealand, indeed, is already doing well there. I could give details of prices obtained which would satisfy any one as to the possibilities of that market. There is there, too, a great field from which to obtain immigrants ; but neither in Canada nor the United States of America can reliable  information be obtained regarding Australia. Naturally, the Canadian Government does not go to any trouble to advertise us, because it knows that Australia will in future be the great rival of Canada. While I was travelling through the country, many persons called on me to learn about Australia. We should have commercial agents, not only in the United Kingdom, but also in Canada and the United States, to assist in placing our products on their markets. The Government might get no direct monetary return from this enterprise, but the community would benefit greatly. If business men were appointed, large markets would be opened up for our products. I have correspondence in my possession from persons in the middle of Canada who wish to get agencies for the disposal of Australian fruit and other produce. I am under the impression that it would be an advantage to Australia to establish an All-Red line between Sydney, New Zealand, and Vancouver. The Prime Minister may have a special reason for discontinuing the subsidy, but I am strongly convinced that the subsidy is necessary. Further, I believe that a line of steamers subsidized solely by the Commonwealth would pay handsomely in the near future, by giving a larger market for Australian produce in Canada and the United States. We shall have to provide, too, for the distribution of the produce at the other end. At the present time certain individuals sometimes secure the whole of the space on a line of vessels, with a view to controlling importation and keeping up prices. This is a thing that we should prevent. I think that we could get from Canada and the United States, as well as from Great Britain, men who would bring with them capital amounting in time to millions. I have a scheme in my mind, which I shall not detail now, but which I shall be pleased to lay before the Minister, which I think would enable a new source of immigration to be tapped. The immigrants I speak of would be men able to purchase farms, and settle here. The corollary of progressive land tax is to do everything possible to settle the large estates that are subdivided and made available. The Government should do everything possible - it could be done at a nominal cost - to bring out persons with capital. </para>

                        <para>- The land tax is making land available. The progressive land tax was never intended, as some honorable members opposite would lead us to believe, to find homes for the homeless or land for the poor. Any one with common sense would understand that the subdivisions of large estates could only be acquired by fairly well-to-do men, but the class of which I speak as coming here will doubtless be capable of taking up improved holdings on these subdivisions. In conclusion, I trust that no time will be lost in inquiring into the allegations regarding Fiji, or in making some very drastic alteration in connexion with the advertising of Australia and its products. </para>

                <para>I am personally glad to observe the attitude taken up in reference to this Conference, and to observe that it is regarded as a sort of permanent organization of the Empire. It is felt that it has within itself the germ of what will ultimately grow into a distinct organic instrument of government for the well-being of the Empire as a whole. There are at present two trends of thought, one towards Imperialism and another towards Nationalism, in different parts of the Dominions. As far back as  1002, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier pointed that out in a very marked way when he referred to the different portions of the Empire as &#34; a galaxy of independent nations.&#34; Our title as a nation is sometimes subject to criticism ; and it is interesting to recall the fact that, when the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on behalf of the Imperial Government, sent his message to us at the inauguration of the Commonwealth,  Her  Majesty&#39;s Ministers said that they welcomed Australia to her place amongst the nations united under  Her  Majesty&#39;s sovereignty, and confidently anticipated for the new Federation a future of ever-increasing prosperity and influence. They contemplated from the beginning that we were admitted as a nation under the Crown; and this tendency to Imperialism and the tendency to Nationalism were marked very distinctly at the last Conference. As a practical application of the two principles, we have finally the sanction given to the Naval Agreement. The <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 4th August,  191 1,  said - </para>

                <para class="block">I hope that we shall be able to keep the question of Defence out of the arena of party politics; but this paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech clearly raises the question as to who is responsible for the evolution and ultimate development of the Naval Agreement. The statement is that the Naval Agreement was the policy of the Labour party ; and the Prime Minister; &#34; after saying that honorable members on the  front Opposition benches were quite familiar with his views, referred to a document, the contents of which, he said, were not discussed, implying that that document was really the foundation of the Naval Agreement - an agreement which is practically that of the whole of the Empire. Hence it is only just, even from a purely historical  point of view, that we should know the origin of the agreement. Fortunately, there are official documents which speak for themselves. </para>
                <para>I do not desire to go back to the speeches and resolutions in this House; but the first official document is in the form of a despatch sent out by the Admiralty on the 20th August, 1908, formulating the principles and ideas which had been expounded by the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth with regard to an agreement in substitution for the existing agreement. That despatch is really the foundation and basis of the present Naval Agreement, for every fundamental principle contained in the present agreement is there set out. The very phraseology of the document to which the Prime Minister referred - a document which is available, and was laid on the table and discussed - is taken from that earlier despatch. The document states that the Government are prepared to undertake the responsibility of naval defence; and if we refer to the despatch of the 15th April, 1909, we find the second clause in almost the same words - </para>

Moreover, the Deakin Government made certain proposals for a fleet. These provided the solid foundation on which could be formed a useful addition to the Imperial Fleet in these waters. They were set aside by the Fisher Government, who proposed a flotilla of destroyers. Afterwards the Deakin-Cook Government&#39;, in conjunction with the Admiralty, formulated the actual unit which to-day constitutes the Australian unit in the Imperial Fleet.

                        <para>- The remarks which I have already made in regard to our naval policy will apply also to the land defences of Australia. It has been urged that to the present Government belongs the credit of having introduced in Australia the principle of compulsory service, but let me say at once that I am glad that it saw fit to accept the report, obtained at the instance of the Deakin Government, from Lord Kitchener, and to adopt the principles therein laid down. We cannot overlook the notorious fact that it was the ex-Minister of Defence - the honorable member for Parramatta - who first gave the principle of compulsory service statutory form. In this connexion I am sure that we shall all bear testimony to the exceptionally fine, work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, who, as Minister of Defence, had first of all to grapple with the whole question of compulsory service from the departmental view. Upon him rested the work of formulating a scheme that could be put into practical shape. Every one who has had experience in governmental matters will admit that the first draft of any scheme is always the most difficult to prepare. A draft having been formulated, you have before you a scheme on which you can build as you please. The whole system of Imperial cooperation was also dealt with by previous Administrations on the lines that have been ultimately agreed to. </para>

                <para>I sincerely trust that we shall be able to keep defence matters out of the arena of party political strife, because when Australia goes to war we shall know neither Liberal nor Conservative, neither Laborite nor Socialist. Every man will be known only as an Australian, and expected to do his best for his country. We cannot, for one moment, give countenance to the idea that war having been declared, either by or against Great Britain, we can remain neutral. Such a doctrine as the neutrality of the Dominions is impossible. It is all very well for the Dominions to say, &#34; We are not going to enter into a war until we have ascertained whether or not it is justifiable,&#34; but once we are &#34;at war, and the Empire is threatened, the instincts of unity and self-preservation will override all other considerations, and we shall all desire to do our utmost to maintain our integrity as a nation. </para>

                    Pollock recently pointed out that, whilst the several Dominions may claim to be nations, they are really units of the Empire, and, as such, are not recognised in the realm of international law. In the eyes of international law there is no such thing as an Australian or a Canadian nation. In the community of nations the British Empire alone is recognised by them. Our King is the representative of this unity of the nation. Although a unit might desire to be neutral the right to remain so would not rest with it. It would remain with any enemy at war with the Empire. A unit might desire to be neutral, but the nation at war with Great Britain might say to it, &#34; We decline to recognise your neutrality.&#34; The position reminds one of the story of the Chinese official who attended a great international Conference, and remarked, when it was declared that no nation should go to war until a proclamation had been issued, &#34; But what about your giving us notice when you want to fight, and we do not want to fight you.&#34; Whether one of the units of the Empire wanted to fight or not would not be of much moment in the case of Great Britain being involved in war.
                </para>
                <para>In the event . of an outbreak of hostilities, Australia would not be asked whether she was or was not neutral. The chief consideration on the part of the enemy would be as to whether by taking Australia, it could weaken the Empire, and at the same time obtain a valuable acquisition. The enemy would be concerned far more with a question of that sort than with any theoretical question of neutrality. In the circumstances, I think that honorable members, on all sides of the House, must agree that if .the Empire were at war Australia must be at war. There can be no question of neutrality when the integration or disintegration of &#34;the Empire is at stake. </para>
                <para>I propose now to deal with the sugar question, and am glad that the Government have announced their intention of appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the position of the industry. The honorable member for Capricornia, who has recently entered this House, took up the demand made by his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archer,</inline> for the appointment of a Commission, although I do not think he advocated such an appointment during the election campaign, and the Government, after considerable delay, have consented to such an appointment being made. The Prime Minister tells us, however, that the Commission is not to be on the lines of that appointed by the late Government. What were those lines? In the first place, the Commission was to be absolutely nonpolitical. Our desire was that there should be a judicial investigation of the industry in all its aspects, free from all party political considerations, so that the findings of the Commission would have the confidence of the public. The public want to learn the position of the sugar industry in all its bearings. The people of Queensland believe that the industry is of vital importance to Australia, and are confident that that fact will be clearly established by any investigation that may lake place. </para>
                <para>A Royal Commission appointed by the Queensland Government to inquire into certain questions relating to the sugar industry furnished a report in March last, in which we have the following paragraph: - </para>
                <para>As  a result  of  much deliberation we are  of  opinion that, in view  of  the paramount importance  to  Queensland, and to Australia  as  a whole, of the close settlement for defence and development purposes  of  the north-eastern coast line  of  this State, and  of  the shores of the Northern Territory of South Australia, settlement only attainable by the permanent location thereon of an agricultural population, it is highly improbable that the Legislature controlling the destinies of the Commonwealth, and of the sugar industry, will at any future time take action which will defeat such objects. </para>
                <para>The Queensland Government Statistician in his report on the sugar statistics for 1910 states that - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The activity in sugar cultivation is evidenced by the much greater number of farmers returned as cultivating cane  for  manufacture in  1910  as compared with previous years, the figures being  -19083727;1909, 3,947;and1910, 4,232,  the average area for each cultivator being -  1908, 33  acres;  1909, 32  acres; and  1910, 34  acres;  so  it does  not  appear that growers are disposed to restrict the area which they place under cane, or that the greater number of planters is due to the subdivision of large estates. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>These reports clearly show that the industry is of the utmost importance in helping us to permanently settle the people in the north. The problem of the settlement of the northern part of Australia is thrown upon us as a Commonwealth,&#39; and we have to encourage industries that will give profitable employment and induce people to settle there. In that respect the sugar industry has done, and will do, good work. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure of that. When we draw a line from Rockhampton&#39; across the continent to Western Australia, we find that in an area representing at least one-half of the Commonwealth - probably the largest part of it - we have a population of only about 100,000 white persons, so that from our point of view that part of Australia is not effectively occupied. It is for us to determine how to meet the trouble ; and only by the encouragement of industries such as this can we hope to meet it. Those who have investigated the position of affairs in the north readily admit that no industry is more suitable for the development of settlement there. The importance of the sugar industry is admitted by all parties, and what we desire to find out is the extent of its operations. The industry affects, first of all, the growers, without whom we cannot have either the worker, the manufacturer, or the refiner. I dissent from the view taken by the Minister of Trade and Customs when he said that he considered the worker all the time. </para>

                        <para>- They certainly are, and we owe a debt of gratitude to them. Whilst we have been talking of a White Australia they have converted our talk into something practicable. With wonderful loyalty to our ideals, they have patiently, ably, and industriously worked out and solved a problem that has puzzled other parts of the world. The question affects the workers, the growers, the refiners, the manufacturers, and the consumers. Hence the proposal of the late Government was that a Royal Commission of a non-political character, presided over by a Judge, should be appointed to inquire into every aspect of the .industry. It has been contended that the Government want a Royal Commission with power to compel witnesses to give evidence; but honorable members quite overlook the fact that the Royal Commissions Act gives all the powers necessary in that respect. Witnesses are compelled to attend and to answer, so that all the required information can be obtained. I have shown the kind of Commission we proposed. What is the Prime Minister going to do? He says his Royal Commission is not to be. on the lines of that suggested by his predecessors. What lines is it to go on? Is it to deviate from any of the lines I have indicated - non-political, impartial, sitting in public, possessing compulsory powers of attendance, and conducting an investigation into every aspect of the industry, with power to report on all its aspects? </para>

                        <para>- I have no sympathy with the man who refuses to answer a question properly put. Personally I should like to see this Royal Commission armed with all requisite power to investigate the truth. I . am sure there would be no opposition in that respect from this side of the House. Is that the only point in which the Prime Minister will deviate from our policy? If it is I am very glad to hear it. If, however, there are to be on this Commission one or two strong political partisans who will not judicially investigate the matter, but will simply put questions to prove a particular theory of their own, the Commission will be discredited. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the honorable member moved in that matter himself, and that it was agreed to appoint a Commission of members of this House. That Commission may have done most excellent service, for which the country ought to be deeply grateful, but I am not asking for that sort of body to conduct this inquiry. The Prime Minister also stated that there was justification for delaying the appointment of this Commission, and that no body of men could make a full and fair investigation -of the sugar industry in six months, even if they worked from the date of their appointment. My hope is that they will not take much longer than six months. I believe that by working night and day they can accomplish their task in the time. At the close of last year the Queensland Government desired to inquire into the question of whether they should construct any new central mills. That involved a long and full investigation. The Commission was appointed at the end of November, took evidence on 7th December,  1910,  for the first time, and on roth March, 1911, its report was handed to the. Government.&#39; That was an important inquiry, involving the consideration of -the establishment of mills, the nature of .the country, the consumption of sugar, the present and future demands of </para>

The Commission investigated the political aspects of the industry, the problem of white and coloured labour, went into the whole of the conditions, and considered means of reviving the sugar and all other tropical industries also. Yet they took only four months to do the work. Since then the industry has been put on a more permanent footing, the whole of the work is more systematized, statistical information is better collected,  the Customs Department have a complete record of administration extending over nearly ten years, and a series of central mills, the whole of whose experience is tabulated every year, is in existence. An enormous mass of information is therefore accessible to any Commission without very much difficulty. Many of the vexed problems which require investigation can be simply dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to all those mills which have been assisted by the State by advances. There is a whole series of them, starting at Nambour in the south and going right up to Cairns. Their returns and balance-sheets are published regularly. We know the exact price they pay for cane, what it costs to manufacture, and what wages are paid in all the factories. Those mills being organized on that basis it is much easier to investigate the actual facts concerning certain aspects of the industry. After all, if the information was tabulated in only three of those mills, they would be like three little laboratories of experiment, illustrating the whole movement. </para>

It is like everything else. They are dead against a policy until they get into power.

                <para>Although for nearly a fortnight the various Departments have been under criticism, not one Minister has made an answer to the statements of the Opposition, except by way of interjection. It would be more in accordance with the dignity of honorable gentlemen opposite, and conduce to the better understanding of affairs, if they made formal replies to the criticism of the Departments which they control. We, on this side, as our actions prove, desire an investigation of the affairs of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The Prime Minister at the head of the last Government stated that it was his intention that existing conditions should remain unaltered until a Royal Commission could recommend some more satisfactory way of dealing with the sugar industry, having regard to the necessity of preserving Australia as a white country, and keeping the industry in existence. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the Minister does not read the speeches of his opponents. Apparently he acts on advice similar to that given to Labour supporters in Queensland, who were told not to go to Liberal meetings lest they might be converted to Liberal views. The advantage of going to meetings of one&#39;s opponents is that one sometimes hears statesmanlike proposals, such as that of the honorable member for Herbert, who said that if the wages asked for in the sugar industry were not&#39; paid, the sugar industry might be established in Papua. He asked, &#34; What would happen then to the Queensland sugar industry?&#34; I ask, what would become of White Australia if we encouraged the use of black-grown sugar from Papua? </para>

                        <para>- In 1906, the then Prime Minister outlined, at the Premiers&#39; Conference, a scheme under which the Commonwealth would co-operate with the States in different ways. Unfortunately, the offer was declined. Had it been accepted, there would not be to-day hundreds of immigrants desirous of coming to Australia, but unable to get accommodation on vessels. I understand that this Government contemplates an expanding immigration policy, and in that it will have the assistance of most honorable members. I am glad that the Ministry has taken a step towards creating an Agricultural Bureau by appointing an agricultural expert for the Northern Territory. </para>

I am glad to know that the establishment of a Department of Agriculture is intended. The Government have been asked from time to time to undertake the investigation of certain pests and diseases ; and I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McAlpine</inline> has a four years&#39; appointment to investigate apple diseases. The sugar-growers of Queensland wish to have an expert investigation of a grub pest which, as the honorable member for Herbert knows, has destroyed thousands of tons of cane.: They have asked for a scientific investigation. It would be infinitely more satisfactory, from an administrative point of view, if a small body of experts was appointed straight away, in view of the many pressing national problems which materially affect production. In my own electorate the fruit-fly pest has completely destroyed the fruit industry. </para>

                <para>What steps are being taken in order to make the Meteorological Department more efficient? During last session it seemed that the Post and Telegraph Department were blocking the project by not allowing the rainfall reports to be widely distributed, and thus afford information to people on, for instance, long stock routes. The Minister of Home Affairs took a note of the complaints made, promising to include them in his &#34; system;&#34; and I hope there will be some result during , the present session. The Meteorological Department should be an important adjunct of government in assisting those who are engaged in production. I am glad to notice that the Government have, in their programme, a Bankruptcy Bill, the necessity for such a measure having been clearly shown in a case at Adelaide last week. A young man came from Adelaide to Victoria with about &#163;230 of capital, and advertised that he was prepared to lend from&#163;5,000 to &#163;50,000 on any good security. He &#34; took down &#34; a tramway employe for&#163;50, and a woman also was a victim of what the Judge called &#34; misrepresentation and grave fraud.&#34; Altogether this young man had about twenty-nine creditors in Melbourne, not even paying his cabman, and Commissioner Russell, of Adelaide, remarked - </para>

                        <para>- I have not considered the point carefully, but I think there should be some satisfactory evidence that an agreement cannot be arrived at before we legislate. So far as I can gather from State Premiers, the Government have submitted a proposal to compensate the States by paying, from the  1st  July,  1910,  interest at the rate of  3  per cent. only, at the agreed-on value, with a sinking fund of&#189; per cent. To this Queensland objects, and claims3¾ per cent., the Premier of that State pointing out that&#189; per cent. per annum invested at3&#189; per cent. requires a period of sixty years to amount to  , &#163;100.  If a State borrows from the Commonwealth, interest at the rate of3¾ per cent. has to be paid. Properties on which loan moneys have been expended have been transferred to the Commonwealth ; and on those moneys a higher rate of interest has to be paid ; and yet only  3  per cent. is offered, while the Commonwealth exacts3¾ per cent. </para>

I notice that the Victorian Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> yesterday said that the Government of his State did not regard the offer of the Commonwealth as fair, and that, pending the payment of the principal, the interest should be at the current rate of 3f per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps he does. I believe absolutely in the integrity of our Attorney-General, but the public outside cannot understand a man being in the difficult position of having perhaps to prosecute himself. I am not speaking in any partisan spirit, but I think it highly desirable that honorable members should not place themselves in any position in which their duties may come into conflict with their interests. A man in a public position has only one predominating duty, and that is his duty to the public rather than to any particular section of it. I hope that we shall see others follow the splendid example of the honorable member for Cook, who, in the interests of his country, deliberately retired from his position as secretary of an association of railway servants rather than remain in the throes of a terrible conflict between duty and interest. </para>

                    <para>.- It is only natural that on such a motion as that now before us the administrative acts of the Government during the recent long recess should come up for review. I do not intend, however, to say anything against them at this stage, although during the Budget debate I may have to address myself to one or two matters relating to them. Labour Ministries have always had the reputation of being capable administrators ; but whilst I recognise their ability, my respect for their capacity as administrators has not been increased by what I have witnessed during the last nine months. During this debate, the actions of the Government have been criticised at some length, but I am sure that no attempt has been made to reflect on their personal integrity, and when I dare to criticise their administration, it will be in a purely political sense. It seems to me that Labour Ministers, like others, are very human, and that their administrative ability is neither better nor worse than that of other Governments. I am not altogether at one with those who have spoken rather harshly of the conduct of our representatives at the recent Imperial Conference. On the whole, I believe that they did fairly well, and that the Conference itself marked another step forward in our Imperial relationships. I was glad to gather from the press reports of the Conference that the Prime Ministerhimself invariably spoke in truly Imperialistic tones. Indeed, I never doubted the right honorable gentleman&#39;s loyalty, and I fail to see how he could have done otherwise than speak as an Imperialist, in view of what had already been done in the direction of defence before he left for England. The most pleasing feature of our defence system is its Imperialistic character. When the Fusion Government were in office,  Colonel Foxton  was sent to a Defence Conference in London, and upon his report that Government based their naval defence scheme, which is remarkable for having added another unit <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Imperial Navy, and for the character of the deep sea ships for which it provided. The Australian Naval Unit will be part and parcel of the British Empire Fleet. During the last general election campaign, the present Prime Minister, on the public platform, adopted practically the naval defence scheme which the Fusion Government had already initiated, and that scheme was in substance the foundation of our naval defence system of to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. More than once, both inside and outside this chamber,I have heard representatives of the Labour party claim the present naval policy as their own, and&#39; assert also that they gave to Australia the principle of compulsory military training. As a matter of fact, only one member of their party - the Attorney-General - was an enthusiast in the cause. Year in and year out, he submitted to the House a motion providing for the adoption of the principle of compulsory training. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know about that; but I do know that the Fusion Government were the first to give legislative effect to the principle. All this marks a step forward. The present-day utterances of the Liberal party in Great Britain show a great advance from an Imperialistic stand-point on the utterances of their predecessors of thirty or forty years ago. The Imperial Conference marks a forward movement, and a distinct advance was made when, at the last Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey agreed that the representatives of the Dominions should be consulted as far as possible in regard to the making of future treaties. Another forward step was that taken by the British Government in admitting to the inner secrets of the Cabinet the representatives of the Dominions. The process of evolution is going on, and I do not think it will be long before we shall see established a consultative body consisting of representatives of Great Britain and the Colonies, and followed possibly by a body acting for the defence of the whole Empire, which will not only be consultative, but possess executive power. I hope that there will be no undue forcing of the growth of this Imperial sentiment, for many a scheme which at the first glance appears to have much to recommend it is found, on careful examination, to be a bad one. It was at the last Conference that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward went so far as to bring in a scheme providing for a sort of central or Imperial Government. That scheme was altogether too premature, and it was not adopted. During the Conference, there was also some talk, notably on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, of the Dominions remaining neutral after Great Britain had been drawn into war, but such talk 1 am glad to see does not find much favour either here or in Canada. A very strong campaign against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier on this, as well as on other points, is now being conducted in the Dominion, the people of which are loudly protesting their loyalty to the Empire. What, after all, would be the position of one of the Dominions that desired to be neutral when Great Britain became involved in war? It would not be for the Government of the Dominion to say whether or not it should remain neutral. The determination of its neutrality would rest with the enemy. If Great Britain were at war with some European Power that required more lands for colonizing purposes, it would be for that Power to say whether or not we should remain neutral, and if it saw an easy chance of taking Australia, it would not have much respect for any profession of neutrality on our part. So much has been said by other speakers regarding the proceedings of the Conference that I do hot wish to dwell upon them, but before I leave the subject, I may say that I am not altogether in favour of the decision that the question of the control of the fleets of the several Dominions in time of war shall rest with the Dominion Governments themselves. It would have been far better to concede straight out at the Conference that, on the declaration of war the Dominion fleets should pass automatically under the control of the British Admiralty. If we go to war we shall have to rely chiefly on the Navy, and all the operations and strategies of that arm of the service must be conducted by the Admiralty authorities in London. It is hard to conceive of a case where the Dominions will not hand over their fleets immediately war is declared, and that is all the more reason why our representatives should have agreed to the course I have indicated. At the Conference the various Prime Ministers said the fleets would, so far as they were concerned, practically always be at the disposal of the Mother Country. When the question of the representation of Australia at the Coronation was debated here last year several honorable members, including myself, drew attention to the fact that no provision was made on the Estimates for the sending of a military contingent. We considered that it would be a shabby action on the part of Australia not to be so represented, when all the other Dominions would have contingents there. The excuse which I have seen put forward in print by the Minister of Defence is one of the flimsiest imaginable. It appears now that we were not represented there by a contingent because the Government did not want Australia to appear in the eyes of the world as a military nation. The Minister also said that if troops had been sent as an advertisement it would have been of little value, because no one would have recognised them, and, as a matter of fact, South African and other troops were often mistaken for Australians. We are getting a cheap advertisement if that is so, but&#34; I am sure none of us wish to advertise Australia in that way. I am afraid that statement is not worth very much, seeing that all the papers must have advertised the fact throughout the United Kingdom that Australia was not represented by a contingent on this occasion, and their readers must have thought it rather a shabby proceeding on our part. A good deal of attention has been directed to the sugar question during this debate. The Government have been very remiss in their treatment of it. We are producing to-day about  200,000  tons of sugar, which is about the amount the Australian public consume per annum. Unless there is a material improvement in the conditions, it seems to me that our annual production will not rise beyond the mere supplying of the local demand. Imagine the great potentialities of Australia for sugar-growing stopping short at a production of  200,000  tons ! I am sure that was never contemplated by this Parliament when it established the White Australia policy, and went out of its way to put the industry on a sound basis, lt must have been expected that Australia would establish a big export trade in sugar, being naturally fitted for its&#39; production. Some of the best of the tropical areas in Queensland, and in the Northern Territory, ought to be devoted to sugar production. Are they to be left lying idle? All we are doing is to supply our own local needs from a small part of the lands that should be under sugar. The Government are much to blame. The Deakin-Cook Government went so far as to prepare the ground for the appointment of a Commission to investigate the condition of the industry, and the present Government should have appointed the Commission as soon as they took office. They refused to do so, and gave no straightforward answers to questions on the subject during the whole of last session. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister would give no straightforward answer as to what the Government intended to do. He brought a Bill down in a helpless fashion to repeal that part of the original sugar legislation of this Parliament which provided for a sliding scale for the Excise and bounty. In that way he left the bounty and Excise in the same state as they were in years before, continuing them for an indefinite period.  The Government have been decidedly weak in their treatment of this great question. The Prime Minister&#39;s excuse for not appointing a Commission was that he thought it would involve a long and tedious inquiry and a waste of time. The Government could have appointed the Commission eighteen months ago, and they now announce that they are going to make the appointment. When the Prime Minister said the inquiry would be long and tedious, the honorable member for Kooyong told him that the report was to be presented within six months, and the honorable gentleman replied that it could not be done. If it could not be done in six months then, it is not likely to be done in six months now. The excuse was a very flimsy one, and the Government deserve severe condemnation from the House, and, in fact, from the whole of the people, for their dilatory and slip-shod treatment of the question. The people of Australia have some time been paying <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> or ,&#163;5 a ton more than the same quality &#39;of sugar can be bought for outside Australia. This means the payment by the consumers of Australia of about ^1,000,000 per annum. That is a lot of money to pay to bolster up an industry which, apparently, can only turn out enough sugar to meet the local demands. It is not fair to the industry, or to the State of Queensland, to leave the question in its present condition of uncertainty, and it is certainly not fair to the fruit and jam industries. I am not going to draw invidious comparisons as to the number of people employed in the sugar industry and the fruit and jam industries, but there is no reason why we cannot give the sugar industry all the assistance it needs without injuring the others. We have heard a great deal from the Government, and their supporters, about nationalizing this and other matters. There was no need for them to nationalize the sugar industry. They could have subsidized a refinery on co-operative lines had the concern worked properly and skilfully, because private enterprise would have been engaged in it, and have received their money back in instalments. They would then have established a competitor to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the people of Australia would have had a fair test of whether or not they could get sugar below the rates they are paying at present. </para>

                        <para>- The Government would not desire to make money in such a case. They would get the money which they advanced returned, with interest, at certain periods, and when the refinery was thoroughly established Australia would have a good asset. If we have to wait for the industry to be nationalized, I am afraid that the people of Australia are still going to suffer for some time from the sugar trouble. Ministers propose to take a further flight in the realm of finance, and promise an amendment in the Australian Notes Bill. What is intended has not been disclosed, though it has been stated in the press that the reduction of the reserve to 25 per cent, on all notes above ,&#163;7 ,000,006 will be proposed. </para>

                        <para>- It would be a greater pity if, when the notes were presented, there were no gold with which to meet them, and if the views of some honorable members obtain effect, that may be the position before many years have passed. I did not take fright when the Notes Bill was introduced, though I felt that the Government was substituting for the existing system one less effective and not so safe. The only advantage which the country has got by the change is the slight revenue from the notes issued. </para>

                        <para>- There are bankers who read and study questions of finance, and others who are mere automata, though, of course, I do not apply the word to any honorable member. Some of the remarks of the honorable member for Richmond fell, I think, like a bomb in the camp opposite. In regard to its banking proposals generally, the Government seems not to have consulted any expert. I hope, however, that its proposals will prove satisfactory. Ministers deserve to be taken to task very severely upon their attitude regarding Tariff reform. I have nothing to say now regarding the relative merits of Free Trade and Protection, but the country has declared more than once for a protective policy, and Ministers are for the most part Protectionists, yet they tell the manufacturers who make out a good case for an alteration of the Tariff which will give them more equitable conditions and greater protection that the duties will not be increased until the workers get their fair and proper share of Protection. That is a strange position for pledged Protectionists. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how many awards there are; but the Wages Board Act of Tasmania was amended only the other day in a liberal direction. Several Wages Boards are already gazetted, and others may be formed as desired. The Tariff is not being handled in the way Protectionists have a right to expect. The manufacturers of this country have waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs in deputation after deputation. </para>

                        <para>- They must have made up their minds that it is of no use; but my memory serves me badly if, during the recess, I did not read of several deputations to the Minister. The plea now put forward in regard to the new Protection is a very shallow pretence, and is surely intended to cover up something. Under the Wages Board system the workers are as likely to get their fair share of Protection as under any other. The only difference between the new Protection of the Labour party and the new Protection advocated by anybody else seems to be that an . Arbitration Court is desired instead of Wages Boards. Would the workers fare any better if the Arbitration Court were substituted? On the score of promptitude and subsequent harmonious relations, all the evidence is in favour of Wages Boards as an infinitely more economical system. These Boards are composed of experts, thus obviating the necessity for calling expensive evidence. What is the good of placing a specially-trained lawyer on the Bench to deal with subject-matter he knows nothing about, and as to which he can only be guided by expert evidence? As it is now  4  o&#39;clock, I ask leave to continue my remarks next Tuesday. </para>
