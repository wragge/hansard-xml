                        <para>.- From my knowledge of the statement made last night by the Minister in regard to the Northern Territory, I am indebted to the apparently fairly-full reports in this morning's newspapers. I hope, however, that those reports have omitted a good deal that the honorable member was expected to say by way of a declaration of Government policy. I found a 'number of interesting statements as to the present position and a few vague anticipations, but could detect nothing in the shape of a permanent policy or any reasons for the failure to give such a statement of policy. We have in the Northern Territory an enormous and rather embarrassing heritage in respect of the particular character of its resources that are readily available. Speaking generally, there are evidently great opportunities for the grazing industry. These, to a certain extent, have been taken advantage of, and have been a source of considerable prosperity to some of the earlier settlers. In a few directions they are being developed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidman</inline> and others associated by him, as well as by other large enterprises. But while that is satisfactory, so far as it goes, it makes comparatively little for the peopling of the country. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Apart from the few isolated proposals for practical action that were made by the Minister last night, there was nothing that  would suggest to the average 'citizen, deeply 'interested in the peopling of the Northern Territory, any promise that a scheme with, that object in view is within measurable distance. ' The one item of satisfaction is that the Minister proposes to take an early opportunity of making himself personally acquainted* with the Territory. That is a wise and desirable step, although the time allotted ' for it does not promise anything like the searching inquiry necessary. This omission will, I assume, be supplied by some other arrangement. People, and yet again people, and always people, are the main desideratum, the aim of every intelligent citizen who considers our problem in the Northern Territory. Action of a very judicious character has been taken in the selection of Professor Spencer for the office he has to fill. I doubt if it would have been possible to find the world over a man more suited for the greater .part of the work he has taken in hand. That fair and, if possible, generous and sympathetic consideration that is due to the aboriginal population of the Territory, which has suffered a good deal at the hands of lawless people of our own colour, is likely to be extended to them by Professor Spencer, whose sympathies with them as a student of their beliefs and customs make him a: most fit person for this task. This appointment is a guarantee that the aboriginal population is certain to be well dealt with. </para>
                    <para>But what of the white population, small as it is, already there, and the white population that we desire to see there as soon as possible? I noticed the reference made by the Minister to the 500,000 acres of land of good quality in one area, and similar promises that other localities held out. But we have not been informed whether the Minister has on foot any scheme that really means, without further delay, a commencement of the settlement of all lands proved to be fruitful. Has the Minister considered the suggestion often made in this  House as to an extension of the Pine Creek railway eastward to that plateau of the Territory where the prospects of cultivation are good and the climatic conditions most favorable ? </para>

                            <para>- Speaking generally, we have three openings in the Northern Territory for the 'man who is prepared to com1 bine agriculture with general farming. These are furnished by the two great waterways to the east and to the west, and partly by the existing Pine Creek line and railway extensions. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The reports as to the land bordering on these two great waterways, in some cases easily accessible from them, are most encouraging. Even the mission reports from neighbouring areas hold out hope of a very prosperous future for those parts of the Territory. I understand that a good deal of the land on these waterways has already been acquired ; that a good deal of land held- either under freehold or on long leaseholds is situated in these quarters. There are still available, however, in close proximity to, and in some cases on the banks of these rivers, land that can be at once utilized. That being so, we need not wait for the extension of the Pine Creek line to secure settlement. These rivers are navigable for some distance by fairly large vessels, and for a considerable distance by the type of vessel that would suffice for the supplies and products of agriculturists. I should like to hear from the Minister that something in that direction is contemplated at once- The extension of the Pine Creek railway has been in view for many years, and something should be done today to push on with that extension. Meanwhile, why should we not attack the settlement of the Territory by means of these great waterways? In that way we could establish small settlements of capable men, and begin practical tests of the qualities of the soil and the best means of dealing with it. Such tests must be made if we are to provide the necessary object-lesson for .future settlers. </para>
                    <para>I do not propose to detain the Committee, but one could not help feeling greatly disappointed , on reading the Minister's statement. I found that feeling shared by several honorable members with whom I had ah opportunity to speak this morning. It is not that, the impossible is expected, but the Minister's statements did not even seem to suggest an assurance that these tests would be made without further delay. There has been so much inevitable delay in connexion with the Territory that we might be par. cloned if we now feel much more than the customary dissatisfaction since it seems that the actual . beginning with this work on a very small scale may yet be postponed for an- indefinite time. Speaking for the whole House, so far as I know there is a disposition to give Ministers every support-; not to blame them if they make experiments some of which are not successful, or to-refuse men if as settlers they are not the very best the world can supply. </para>
                    <para>We are all pressing for some test in  a  practical way of the application of white labour to the resources of the Territory, and its opportunities for development. I do not hesitate to repeat what has often been said, that the Northern Territory is our weakest spot, and the danger point, of the whole of Australia - the coasts on which all our anxieties are centred. I venture, therefore, to say that if the Minister requires more funds or more encouragement from this Chamber, . to make a dash with . practical objects in view, he will find us not too critical of the cost or other conditions. There will be the strongest disposition everywhere to trust the Minister and his advisers, and to be satisfied if they do something, even if only a 'little, ahead . of that permanent settlement, of which these efforts should be an earnest and guarantee. There is a great deal in example and leadership, and much in the first plunge. Let us begin here and now. We ought to make that plunge now, to authorize the Minister to take action before we rise, although we hope to prorogue within the' next day or so. Under the circumstances I hope the Minister will supplement his statement of last night by a further assurance which will enable us to dose the session with more content as to the prospects of peopling our vast heritage in the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that it is time there was something like a definite policy. The references by the Minister last night are all right so far as they go, but they do not go nearly far enough ; and, in my opinion, we are beginning at the wrong end. It is quite true that there should be experimental farming, but not only in one place; and. I was sorry to hear the Minister last night merely mention Rum Jungle. On the Roper, Adelaide, and Daly Rivers there is practically unlimited room for farms of this kind, whereas at Rum Jungle, operations must be circumscribed. The honorable member for Illawarra knows that on the Daly River there are immense areas on which experimental farms could be established, with further lands for farming expansion. 1 Then, something should be done in the way of finding a market for those who settle iri the Northern Territory. There is a proposal to establish an Export Department, with freezing and chilling works. The Minister does not seem quite sure whether these works will be established at Port Darwin ; but, at any rate, we have a proposal of the kind before us. No doubt all these ideas will have to be adopted in any perfect scheme of development ; but, in addition, there must be ample railway facilities. I have no objection to extending the present line from Pine Creek across the Katherine, tapping some of the Barclay tableland; but we have to remember that the Katherine is a long way from that tableland. However, such a railway must be part of any successful scheme. What I take exception to is the statement of the Minister that he does not look forward to the development of the Territory by Australian labour. Time will prove, I think, that he is altogether wrong in his forecast. Australian labour will have to do the pioneering work, and practically prepare the Territory for other settlers. That being so, the first idea that occurs to any man who thinks seriously on the subject, is to provide facilities for people from the settled parts of Australia to reach the Territory. Intending settlers should never be asked to send their people and their stock by boat on a journey occupying, practically, as much time as a trip to London. I should begin the development of the Territory with people from the settled parts of Australia, and, to that end, there ought to be railway connexions with the States in the South. </para>

                            <para>- There will, of course, ultimately be a railway to Western Australia in the far north-west, where there is some very good timber and other -country. Another good reason for the establishment of such railway connexions is found in the forecasts of future seasons. In Parlia-ment and out of Parliament, by every business "man and expert, it is recognised that our 'good seasons of the past seven or eight years, will, in the ordinary course of events, be followed by dry seasons. Without wishing to appear as an alarmist, I may point out that we have, in cycles, our lean and our fat years, though possibly the lean years of the. future may not be nearly so disastrous as those in the past; Improved conditions, better methods of tilling the soil, and the greater provision made against droughts in consequence of the lessons learnt from the past, will reduce the amount of loss in future bad seasons. If we had had railway communication from the States to the Northern Territory we should have been able to save, if not the whole, very nearly the whole of the millions of stock that we lost in the most disastrous droughts of the past, because unless it be down in the south-east corner or the extreme south of the Territory, there is no such thing as a drought in that vast area. It has its wet season and its dry season. It has its periodical rains every year as regularly as the sun shines, and with a proper policy of railway development, we shall be able in any similar period of drought to depasture and save millions of our stock in the Northern Territory. Not only would that happen, but every one who went there, and the great bulk of the stock that was taken there, except the fats that would be sent away, would remain in the -Territory. This would be one of the finest things that could happen in the way of development, but it cannot happen with a railway scheme that starts from Pine Creek. Under present conditions all the stock has to be sent by water, which is an impossible proposition, and the same applies to your men. I take it that what the Government have put forward is only a very moderate portion of the scheme which they are going ultimately to introduce in the Territory. We have taken over the responsibility of that huge tract of country with our eyes open, and with a. full knowledge of the liabilities that we were immediately assuming. We are like a man who has a comparatively small holding and takes a large holding alongside. If he keeps it idle he must ultimately land himself in the Insolvency Court and lose both holdings. </para>

                            <para>- It is only a matter of time for the same thing to happen to the Common wealth, unless it undertakes the development of its new holding. Certain work must be done there to get a return, but at present we have to face a loss which will continue unless we have the courage to go in for the necessary development. This will convert a losing proposition into a paying one in at least a reasonable time. I am as confident of that as that I am standing on the floor of the House, but it will not be done with a timid proposition .to extend the railway 60 miles across the Katherine River, nor will it be done by merely catering for the few cattle- owners in the Northern Territory to-day. It can be done only by a vigorous railway policy, which will be followed by people and followed by stock. First must come the pastoral development, then will follow the agricultural development, and after that, there will be the tropical' or closer settlement, all of which are possible in. the Territory. There are three distinct climatic conditions there. There is a stretch of country running 80 miles inland from the 1,200 miles of coastline, with tropical conditions and a 60-inch rainfall. Inside that there is a stretch of country on the eastern side of the Katherine extending into the Barclay tablelands, with semi-tropical' conditions. Inside that again is the MacDonnell Range country running practically through the middle of the Territory, with temperate climatic- conditions. We have a very fine class of country, but none of it can be occupied successfully by sheep to-day, because of ,the want of facilities. Much less can it be occupied for agriculture without railway facilities. With railway facilities, I have no doubt about the future of the Territory. It is an asset which this House need not hesitate to develop. I go further and say that the House, having accepted the responsibility, must, as business men, spend the necessary money on the development of the Territory to make good what has been expended. This will not be done by a mere 60 miles of railway crossing to the Katherine- The question of land tenure is a secondary consideration. It is not the liberality or want of liberality of tenure that constitutes the drawback to that country. The- drawback is want of railway facilities.. Look at it how you will, you must come back to the proposition that everything else is subsidiary to a proper railway development scheme. I take no exception to the proposal for a leasehold system, but I want to impress upon honorable members that we could -absolutely give the land away to-day," as South- Australia could have done, but even then, without proper railway facilities to get people and stock there, and encourage natural development, all your propositions of tenure would be rather a snare and a danger than an advantage. You might find when your railway development had taken place that your country would stand much higher rentals than, it will stand if you throw, it open first, and put your railways in afterwards. The whole scheme for the development of the Territory -and the whole question of rentals ought to be associated with a railway scheme. Give me a railway, and I know what rent to charge for my country. I know what is a fair thing to get back from the people who have been given, the advantage of a railway scheme. That is a very .different proposition from introducing a system of tenure first, and effecting a development policy afterwards. It is time the Government had a fully developed policy for the administration of the Territory. I had anticipated that some properly thought-out scheme would be put before us before this session closed. I understand that there is a proposal that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Francis</inline> should recommend the necessary railway construction. He may be a very eminent fellow. I do not know what ex"perience he has had, but they say he came from Victoria. He is associated now with the railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek. He may be the best man in the world. </para>

                            <para>- There is something in that. I wish for a more comprehensive railway scheme than he is likely to propose. He will never get any reasonable distance beyond the Katherine. I trust that party considerations will not affect our dealings with the Northern Territory. When honorable members and senators visit the Territory during the recess, they should travel through it from South Australia, from New South Wales, and from Queensland, so "that they may be acquainted with its conditions from north to south and from east to- west. Then, when they- come back, they will have something to tell about it. </para>

                    <para class="block">When the last visit, was made, the honorable member for Illawarra and myself, and two gentlemen whose absence from the House we all regret, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchison,</inline> made a long ride across country, and saw a great deal more of it than any other members ot the party . But, after all, we saw but very little, as is plain by following our track on the map, so enormous is the Territory. There will not be any great advantage gained if the party which visits the Territory during the next recess does not do more than the former party did. It should go through the temperate region, travel across the MacDonnell Range country and over the tableland, and pass through the tropical region. During the last visit only the tropical and subtropical parts of the country were visited. At the time I appealed to the Minister then in power to arrange for half u dozen of us to go right across the country, but the excursion was not made, I think because of the cost. I hope that the present Minister will do more than provide facilities for getting to Port Darwin. That is not the Northern Territory, which stretches south from it for  900  miles, and has a breadth of  600  miles. Before th* session ends, I trust that the Minister will make a statement outlining a much more vigorous policy than has yet been proposed. If we do not deal with the Territory more vigorously, we shall only do what South Australia did - pile up deficits - and what we spend will be like throwing money into the sea. To make a success of ,the Territory there must be a large expenditure, and if that expenditure is made in dribs and drabs during a period of ten or twenty years, it will result in failure. One great need is railways. The country needs a number of railways, and, given means of communication, is capable of carrying a large population. </para>

                        COOK (Parramatta)  {11. 16].-  I congratulate the honorable member for Grey - on his sound, sane, vigorous speech. It is evident that he knew what he was talking about, and I hope that his- remarks will be heeded by Ministers. I was profoundly disappointed with the Minister's speech last night. We do not expect him at .his own initiative, and from his own resources, to propound a policy for the, Northern Territory, but we expected to hear of a bold, departmental scheme for the development of the Territory. The honorable member for .Grey rightly says that- the policy . stated last night, will do nothing to lift off the present incubus from the Territory. The Minister told us nothing that we have not always known. We are aware that horses, cattle, and sheep can be bred there, and that mineral resources exist which need development. 'We know, too, that there is agricultural land, and we are acquainted with the advantages of freezing works. What we need is a policy of development which will make use of all these possibilities. We are told that there is a Railway Commissioner there ; I suppose he has been there for some years.

It is farcical to regard a man who is getting  ,£500  or  ,£600  a year in that part of the world as an expert on development by railway extension. This country is cursed more by the policy of doing with the second-best than by anything else. We should be large-minded enough to search for the best, and to press it into the service of the Commonwealth. There are elsewhere those who have had experience in dealing with the problems with which we are faced, ' and the attraction of adventure and a high salary will secure the best talent in the world. . We need to obtain that talent,, and to let it loose in the Northern . Territory, so as to get the full value of it. That ought to have been done long ago. After we have waited twelve months, practically nothing is proposed. AH we know is that a  £500-  a-year-man is going to undertake the work of reporting on railway development. </para>

He would be worth it, if he could sketch out the right policy. I do not suggest that we should immediately pay  ,£4,000  a -year, but we should search for the best talent. If we can get it for less, well and good, but otherwise we must pay for it what is asked. Our prime need is ability and experience. This is not the first time that problems like these with which we are faced have been tackled, and experience counts for everything in regard to them. The Minister last night told us nothing new. He is merely tinkering with the business. We. are losing  ^400,000  a year- on 'the Territory, but even ..if everything 'he . suggests were done,.. ..it would not enable us to overtake the. deficit within twenty years, to say nothing of peopling the country, and giving us the security we ought to feel in respect of the rest of Australia by a policy of development up there. The Territory is being administered by the wrong Department. Whataffinity is there between the Department of External Affairs and the development of an internal policy? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There, again, we have too much concentration. One man is supposed to deal with the establishment of the Federal Capital, the erection of a small arms factory, and a hundred and one other matters. The sooner we press into the service some of the first-rate ability of the world, the better. I am not underrating the men we have. I should be sorry to underrate a man like  Colonel Owen,  whom I believe to be clever, able, and industrious ; but he is struggling to do too much, and the sooner he is relieved of some of the detail of his office the better for the country and all concerned. He is paid much less than he is worth, and whilst he is a very able man, with the problems we have before us, we need a lot of able men. We have in the Northern Territory an area as large as two or three of the countries of Europe, and we have sent up there to look after it a man who is receiving a salary of£650 a year. </para>

                            <para>- Does not the honorable member think that while that officer may be an excellent traffic manager, he may yet know nothing of these problems? We do not expect a traffic manager to discuss theories of engineering and' surveying. This officer may be doing excellent work, and yet be totally unfit to report on the question of railway facilities for the Territory - We need for this work one of the best engineers, and with him a first-class surveyor, with a wide knowledge of country. Two or three such men should have been appointed twelve months ago and set going with all the responsibilities and authority that could have been given to them as a Royal Commission. By this time they would have been ready to make a progress report. This work will have to be done, or the Minister's proposals will mean nothing. You may put down your farms in various districts, but until you know whether you can have railways there what is the good of putting them down. </para>

                            <para>- But I think I know as much of it as some of those who did visit the Territory. I have no faith in my ability to study problems like those now before us by hurrying over the country on horseback. I believe that I can learn as much by reading, and should like to hear some sort of agreement among those who visited the Territory. One of them is perfectly certain that agriculture can be developed in the Northern Territory, and another is equally certain that it cannot. </para>

I am not suggesting that he has not tried to apply his mind to this problem, and the douche of cold water that we may expect from him' presently is not perhaps a bad thing. We cannot do better than look at these matters from all points of view, but there are some things that are fundamental and preliminary to all others, and in this case they have been admirably sketched for us this morning by the honorable member for Grey. Railways and a knowledge of the country are the two first requisites. Let us set to work an experienced surveyor and a railway expert, and we shall begin to solve this troublesome difficulty. First of all we want to know how the proposed railway will meet our defence problem - for this, after all, is not merely a problem of settlement, but a problem of defence. The question of railway gauge will, therefore, have to engage the attention of the Government at any early date. An interjection was made by the late Minister of External Affairs as to what the gauge was to be- </para>

                            <para>- But is a railway of that gauge to be carried into the Northern Territory? Surely that question ought to have been settled before now by the Government ? Yet when it was mentioned last night by way of interjection, whilst the Minister was speaking, it was brushed aside as a mere trifle that meant nothing. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most important of the preliminary considerations. . When we have determined what is to be done for defence, as well as for settlement, we can develop on the lines sketched by the Minister. We can then begin to breed our horses and freeze our sheep. It is useless to commence freezing operations until we know that we can get to market the produce so treated. I believe that it costs from <inline font-style="italic">£25to£30pertontocarry</inline> stores to some of the stations, and it would cost just as much to get their produce to the coast. </para>

                            <para>- No; these freezing establishments will be the salvation of the Territory, and it is very desirable that we should determine the best places at which to establish them. That, again, cannot be determined until our railway policy has been sketched. Thirteen months have elapsed since the Territory came over to us, and do honorable members think that the Minister has yet sketched for us an outline of proposals that will help to lift this incubus from our shoulders, and make the Territory a source of strength, instead of weakness, to Australia? I ask the Minister whether during the forty years of government of the Territory by South Australia there has not been accumulated a series of proposals that will help him? Were the papers relating to the Territory transferred with the Department to the Commonwealth, or do they remain hidden in the South Australian archives? If there are no such papers it seems to me to be a strange reflection on the South Australian Government, and on all its efforts to develop this Territory, of which we have heard so much. The Department of External Affairs having had to do with this matter for thirteen months ought to be in possession of all. the knowledge that is available in South Australia. This ought to have been freely sent over with the Territory, and, on the basis of that, we should surely have had a more bold and statesmanlike proposal for dealing with the Territory than the mere trumpery details furnished to us by the Minister last night. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member,, like myself, is more anxious to perform his duty to the country than to get home. But, having regard to the anxiety I have mentioned on the part of a number of honorable members - quite a natural "feeling at this festive .season, and a feel.ing to which &gt;I was quite "prepared to defer «by adjourning over the Christmas holidays, and resuming work afterwards, as most men outside have to do - it ds rather unfortunate that we should be called upon to deal! with a question of such vital .importance when it is impossible to get the time :to look into it properly, to study the reports that have been presented to us, or to come 'to anything like a satisfactory con.clusion .upon the 'Minister's utterance. Hurried debates of 'this character are -not calculated to solve difficult questions. tff we cannot have time to read through the Minister's pronouncement, we are placed at a disadvantage. Such a condition of things might be tolerated on smaller matters, but it should -not prevail on -questions 'of such vast importance as this is. I am not in favour of slumming the work of this Parliament. I believe in work being well done. If only a little is done, let it be done well. To put a let of work through is no credit to any Government, 'but to put even a small portion of work through well is creditable to those who do it. My motto throughout life has . been to do well the work, whether much or little, that I had to do. That is a consideration, that applies to both parities in Parliament. Public business has -not been given by Parliament of late years that consideration which it was wont to -receive in years 'gone by. </para>

                            <para>- It is not only a question of legislation. We want to interfere in <inline font-style="italic">matters</inline> that might often be well left alone in the public interest. We have, rightly or wrongly, taken over this great Territory, and many members will live not only to regret what they did in this connexion, but to remember what others indicated as likely to be the result. I listened last night to the Minister expounding his policy, and I must say that I was in <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> way struck by the grand ideal to which, according 'to him, we are to look forward. T do not agree with -many of the men who have been there, nor do I agree with many of those who have written about the Territory. The ; honorable member for Par.amatta remarked that he was dependent upon reading (for his information, and I, -too, have read pretty largely on the question. In addition, I went there to see as much as I could see, to hear as much as it was possible to hear, and to learn as much as was available to be learned on a trip of that character. . It was not a question of running round on a pleasure trip. It was a matter of trying to gather information from all available sources. It was not with me a matter of accepting everything I saw. I was at pains to interview the men who came in on that auspicious occasion when the Governor-General was the magnet of attraction. He drew from the interior of the Territory to Port Darwin people who had never been in for years. They were there for us to interview, men who were not prepared to give a .flowery show to those who went there, men who were not like the tin-miners of the West Arm, who had got 'all their best blocks of mica schist built up like a wall in order to show the magnificent prospects of the .tin-mining industry in the district. Any man could see that this display had been preparing for months and months in order to impress the members who made the tour, and results since that time have proved it. 'One would have thought, to see the walls built up of square blocks, with, as it were, their best face to London, that the whole of the West Arm adjacent to Port Darwin was a mass of mica schist- containing nothing but tin. We had to take exhibitions of that kind with a grain of salt, as any man would who knows the world. The Minister, and I say this with all respect, does not comprehend what he is talking about when he speaks of putting a railway down from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. I travelled through that country, and had my eyes open, except when the dust caused me to close them. I remember looking for what I could call a tree, and I discovered nothing in the nature of a tree until about half way, where there was a lagoon in which the water collects in the wet season, and is retained for some period of the dry season. There a Chinaman or two was trying to .grow a few vegetables to relieve people from the possibility of scurvy. </para>

All I can say is that I arn very sorry that anybody should put forward a proposition to build a railway from Pine Creek to' the Katherine River for the purpose of opening up an agricultural district. I am told that, in the first part of his. speech, the honorable member for Parramatta described the place as a land flowing with milk and honey. If he did, he is as far astray as the others. I never saw a bee there, or a bee's nest in a tree. The bert illustration we can have of whether it is or is not a land .flowing with milk and honey is the fact- that the natives of the country , are now, and have been for  centuries, . . deteriorating and diminishing in numbers. - </para>

                            <para>- There are spots where they collected specially to meet the honorable member and the rest of the party who went there. Not only were the white people of the- country drawn to the magnet of the Governor-General's party, but even the black- men were brought in. The best types of black men that could possibly be produced were put on show. In fact, the best, both of human and other exhibits, that the country could provide were put forward. We cannot judge what a country produces when only the best side is shown. You must look a little deeper to find the reality, and not be misled by displays arranged for the purpose. There are fine specimens of the human type among the black people of the Territory. There certainly should be, when we remember that for centuries they have been selecting the best of their species, and preventing the inferior types from reproducing themselves. They have been practicing that system which is advocated to some extent amongst civilized nations, but in their cases the compelling reason has been necessity. We should, therefore, expect to find in a large territory. of that sort samples of robust manhood and womanhood. </para>

                            <para>- I am. dealing with the people who had to live in the Northern Territory long before we took it in. hand. Any one who reads the history of the Territory without bias or prejudice will recognise that for years past there has been a gradual deterioration and reduction of it* population. There are two things that cause the reduction of the native population of. a country. One is the decimation brought about by civilization, and the other is the want of natural food. The real cause of the practises adopted by the natives of the Northern Territory . to restrict the growth of population, long before, the white man went. there, was want of food. The country is unlike the northern part of Queensland .or some of the islands adjacent thereto,, which abound in yams and other natural food. It has no root foods, and it has little in-the way of. animal. food. There were kangaroos there, and I believe there are still some, .although, from what I can-  learn, they are fast passing away. Rabbits were present in the olden days in abundance in one part of the Northern Territory,, but they too, like the natives, have practically,, ceased to exist. Such food as is available for aborigines in other parts of Australia is not available in the Northern Territory to-day.. The honorable member for Illawarra will agree with me that there are splendid flocks of ducks that fly from lagoon to lagoon, and I saw millions of cockatoos, but .the ducks seem to be the- main food of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> native population.. We have first to realize the nature- of the Territory we have taken over ; and . this can be judged by the number and character of the primitive inhabitants, and the prevalence or otherwise of animal and bird life. A subject of this kind should not be dealt with in a haphazard way, or from the point of view of the government of settled countries under normal conditions. Last night, when the Minister spoke of the establishment of an experimental farm, I asked him, in a perfectly innocent and friendly way, whether it would ' not be advisable to postpone the- construction of a railway until  he had seen the district proposed to be traversed. That interjection was replied . to with an insult, the Minister retorting that such an inspection as that proposed would be about as useful1 as the Postal Commission, or words <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> that effect. Such an attitude is not worthy of a Minister of the Crown when friendly advice is offered; and. I can only say that, if the Minister and his colleagues-  make  of the Northern Territory what the Postal Commission endeavoured to make of the Post and Telegraph- Department, they will perform a work of which they may be proud. The-' honorable member for Parramatta asked the Minister whether it  was  proposed  to  adopt the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge for the proposed railway, and the reply" was that that gauge had been adopted for Australia. We must remem&gt;ber, however, that if a 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge is adopted for the proposed railway,  we  shall have  to  rip  up  the whole  of the  line from Pine Creek to Port Darwin ; and this will mean that the reconstruction «of the line will cost more than the extension  to  the Katherine River. Railway building in the Northern Territory is not  the  same kind  of  work that it is in countries with which  we  are better acquainted. For instance, if wood sleepers were used,  the  white ants would not allow them  10  remain long enough  on  the land for the first engine  to  run over them. Anything in the shape  of  wood is devoured  by  this voracious pest ; and, therefore, the sleepers will have  to be of  either iron  or  reinforced concrete, both  of  which are expensive. It is  of no  use declaring that  we  are going  to  do this, that, and the other. We must know how  we  are going  to  carry out the proposed works, and whether their success -will warrant their construction. I have  no  hesitation in saying that if  we  attempt *o establish  an  experimental farm in the district mentioned - I  do  not know what kind  .of  farm - disastrous failure must  reSult,  the expenditure of money being the  Only  thing that will  be  assured. To think of establishing farms in such  a  district is  the  wildest dream, and I  do  not know whence the idea emanated. It has been asked what has been the policy  of  the South Australian Government - whether "they have tried  to  prove the productivity  of  the land during the last forty years. Has the progressive Government  of  South Australia done anything in that time which  we  can take  as  a guide? The question  is  unanswered. The only thing I know  of that  the South Australian Government did  was to  spend enormous sums of money  on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Port Darwin Botanical Gardens. The expenditure was not in hundreds, but in thousands, and it certainly is  an  object lesson  of  what can  be  done with unlimited means. The gardens afford evidence  of  what is possible under . favorable conditions, but they are  no  guide  as to  what can  De  done under normal  or  commercial conditions. During our visit  to  Port Darwin  we  were driven through these gardens, and  Our  attention  was  directed  to a  grove  of  cocoanut trees which, in  the  distance, looked beautiful. I wondered  why we were  not driven through   the  shade .  of that  grove; and, subsequently, when I took a walk in the gardens, I found that' there was hardly a tree that was not riddled by the white ants ; indeed, it was possible to see through some of the trees, and to even walk through others. .This is the result of attempting to override natural conditions. The enemy proved too strong even for the South Australian botanical authorities. </para>

                            <para>- I travelled a few hundred miles in the Territory, and my experience was, that the only difference between one district and another is that the ant-hills are of different shapes. In the days  to. come, when millions of money have been spent in trying to do what cannot be done in the Territory, it will be remembered that there were those of the present day who had the courage to say what they thought. What object have I in saying what is not correct, or in misleading honorable members? I should be unworthy of my position here if I did anything of the sort. I am merely telling honorable members what I know to be true, in order that' both sides of the question may- be presented. We were told by the Minister of External Affairs that the South Australian Government had already proposed a railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, and that there were plans, and so forth in existence. I can well understand that to be the case, and if I knew the date I could tell honorable members the reason. At one time exploration was- being made in an attempt to test the mineral wealth of the Territory, in view of evidence of gold in payable quantities. When foreign capital was being introduced into the State by hundreds, of thousands of pounds to develop what were supposed to be rich gold shows, the South Australian. Government no doubt thought it wise, as the Western Australian Government, recently -did, to construct a railway to the site of the supposed mineral belt. Between Pine  Creek and the Katherine River you see what is left of these -mining ventures. Eldorados of British investors who spent their money to their sorrow. In the light of experience, I say that there is nothing to justify the extension of the railway to Katherine River. </para>

                            <para>- Surely it is not proposed to zig-zag the connexion with Oodnadatta in order to serve the Katherine River ? This question is too big to be dealt with in a few minutes, and I hope that the Minister will not do much until he has visited the Territory. In the next Parliament he should be able to put forward a policy based on his own observations, and on those of the members who accompany him to the Territory, as well as on the information of those on whom he relies for guidance. We shall then be in a better position to discuss the policy, and to determine the best methods for getting a return from our expenditure. I voted for the taking over of the Territory merely because I recognise our responsibility for providing for the defence of the whole continent; but, in my judgment, the continuation of the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta will not be an advantage from the defence point of view. It will traverse country which no invading army could march across. That country is now a protection to us, but if it were crossed by a railway, the hordes of Asiatics whom it is said are seeking an opportunity to invade Australia could take possession of the- northern end, and transport their forces down to the civilized districts, attacking us in the rear, as well as from the front, possibly. I recommend honorable members to read the South Australian reports, and look at the South Australian maps to obtain information regarding the character of this country, and then to make up their minds as to how it compares with other parts of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I did not vote for the Canberra site, but the Canberra land compares with this land as gold with copper. I have given a considerable amount of study to this subject, and I ask honorable members to read the reports carefully, distinguishing between those written at the order of a Government and those written purely for patriotic reasons, to throw light on the nature of the country. The Minister says that there are to be no freeholds in the Northern Territory, but, in any case, no one would be likely to spend money on acquiring freeholds there. At the present time there are men who hold forty-two-year leases there at is a square mile. The Minister can hardly give more liberal terms than that, unless he is going to build houses, and pay men for settling in the Territory. </para>

                            <para>- It will be necessary to offer great inducements to settlement.. That has been done in other places, where men of muscle, not possessed of money, have been got to prove the possibility of the land. No doubt parts of the Territory could be irrigated, though at some cost. There are lagoons miles in length, and so deep that they have not been bottomed, caused by rocky bars in what: should be rivers. They make natural reservoirs, such as do not exist in other parts of Australia, and are not frequent in any other part of the world. Given a suitable climate, land, with water, will produce almost anything; but, of course, irrigation means expense. The Minister should ascertain what the land hear these lagoons is capable of, what is the depth and nature of its soil, and what are the most profitable crops which could be grown upon it. That is where he should spend money on agricultural experiments, because the expenditure is likely to give a profitable result. In the back-blocks of Australia in the early days, no one thought of acquiring freeholds. Men do not seek freeholds until districts have been developed, and proved to be worth something-. It must not be forgotten that there was a time when South Australia put no restriction upon the immigration of aliens into the Northern Territory, when it was open to Malays, Asiatics, and other coloured people, and yet. they did not try to develop or to take possession of it. </para>

                    <para class="block">States, may ultimately produce grasses which will not interfere with the profitable rearing of sheep. That country covers only a small area compared with the whole Territory. What we have to ascertain is what is the proportion of good land in the Territory to the land which is said even by the geological advisers of South Australia to be useless? Is there any indication that even the coloured men in the Territory have a desire to develop the country. There is ample scope and opportunity for them to go on the land. For years, it has been available to them at is. per mile, but we find them either living in the centres of population or fossicking round the old mining plants on which many thousands were expended years ago. Most of them are in business, and they are all degrading the native population that comes within their reach. There is no evidence that the productivity of the land is attracting them from Port Darwin. These coloured races, who have devoted themselves with much success to cultivation in other countries where the land is good, have not availed themselves of the opportunity to take up land in the Northern Territory. I do not wish to speak further at this stage save to say that I have been induced to make these observations bv the statement of the Minister, and that I offer them in good faith to him. I urge the Government to hold their hand before they attempt to apply to the Northern Territory a policy that may not be applicable to it, although it has operated successfully in other parts of Australia. When we enter upon the work of developing the Territory let us clearly understand what we are going to do, and how we are going to do it. We have a right, not only to have an outline of the scheme, but what I may describe as complete plans and specifications, so that we may know what is actually propounded in the way of a developmental policy. Until we have that complete information we should hesitate to spend any large sum on development works. Meantime we may take steps to police Port Darwin and any other part of the coast where a landing might be effected by an enemy. As a matter of fact, I do not think that an enemy is likely to attempt to land in the Northern Territory until we have a railway stretching down to the south. An enemy that desires to take Australia will land further south where there is something to be got. Let us do what is necessary, however, to " police " the coastline for </para>
                    <para class="block">Customs purposes, and to keep an eye on what is being done by the people of adjacent countries. A large proportion of the coastline, particularly in the extreme north, is very muddy, and there are only certain points where a landing could be effected. But wherever it is possible for an enemy to land there should be an effective " policing " of the coast. I hope that the Minister when he visits the Territory will make careful observations, and that he will endeavour as far as possible te make independent inspections. Those interested will show him, as they did in our case, the best side of everything, and, if he does not look further afield, he will come back with a wrong view of the possibilities. Let him interview some of the old men who have been in the Territory for many years. There are unfortunately not many of them. Men do not stay there very long. Two or three of those whom we saw have since' left, but the Minister should seek information apart from those who are specially interested in urging an expenditure of money up there. Let him make careful inquiries, and let him remember that he has to decide, not only what expenditure should be proposed, but what we are likely to get as the result of that expenditure. </para>

                        <para>.- The question of the peopling of the Northern Territory is of the utmost importance from' many points of view, and particularly from the stand-point of the defence of Australia. I have to confess to a sense of disappointment with the statement made last night by the Minister. I listened carefully to his speech, but did not hear him submit any new proposition, or outline any bold policy of development. The proposal to extend the railway to the Katherine River does not meet the position. The honorable member for Grey was absolutely correct when he said that the proper way to develop the Territory is to extend its railway system, since land settlement is sure to follow the provision of railway facilities. We ought not to blame the Minister altogether for his failure to bring down a bold policy of development, for I do not think he has in his Department an officer capable of framing such a policy. To my mind, the Territory is being administered by the wrong Department. The surveyors, engineers, and other officers who would be of material assistance to the Minister in this work are under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, where, under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener-</inline> - who is not only an able surveyor, but a man of many parts, possessing an intimate knowledge of land matters in New South Wales and other parts of Australia - we have the nucleus of what should prove a very valuable branch of the service in securing information for us in regard to the Northern Territory. I trust that the Minister will recognise the necessity, of classifying the land in the Territory, so that we shall not have repeated there in years to come the mistakes made in other parts of the Commonwealth. I hope that land peculiarly fitted for agriculture and closer settlement will not be disposed of for pastoral purposes, so that the Commonwealth, later on, will have the experience of some of the States, and be put to the expense of resuming areas suitable for closer settlement. I was one of those who visited the Northern Territory some two or three years ago, and I took the opportunity to see all that I could within the limited time at our disposal. I joined the riding party to which the honorable member for Grey has referred, and travelled in that way a considerable distance. After all, however, the extent of country that we were able to visit, and not without considerable inconvenience to ourselves, was very limited as compared with the Territory as a whole. I am glad that the Minister proposes to visit the Territory, but if he thinks that he will be able within sixteen days to obtain a knowledge that will fit him to frame and carry out a developmental policy, he will find that he is making a big mistake. He will probably "make a few excursions in the vicinity of Port Darwin, and go down to Rum Jungle, where an experimental farm is to be established. That, as the honorable member for Grey has pointed out, is not a very favorable position for the establishment of an experimental farm. I should have preferred to see one established on the Katherine River or the Daly River, where there is a vast extent of country. </para>

                            <para>- It would be better to establish experimental farms where there are magnificent areas awaiting settlement. Such farms would enable the character of the country to be properly tested, so that settlers would be able to take up land with absolute certainty as to the purposes to which it could be devoted. I saw on the Katherine, the Adelaide, the Daly, and some other rivers that I visited, large areas of some of the finest land I have ever inspected, and I am satisfied that in years to come, those parts of the Territory will carry a very big population if we proceed with development on proper lines. </para>

                            <para>-  I journeyed up the Katherine by boat for  6  or 7 miles, and went down the river a number of miles on horseback. I saw right along the Katherine rich river flats, with fine country gradually sloping away from the river, so that it could be readily irrigated, and if so treated ft would become one of the most fertile portions of the world. We did not have an opportunity to visit the Barclay tablelands and other high portions of the. Territory, and I am not prepared to say what can or cannot be done with them. Whilst in the Northern Territory I had the pleasure of meeting the manager of the magnificent Wave Hill Station, who has resided there for many years, and we were told that that station was carrying between 70,000 and 80,000 head of cattle. I have seen in the Homebush saleyards cattle brought overland from that station, and they were as good a type of bullocks as any raised elsewhere in Australia. The honorable member for Grey has described the Barclay tablelands as within the temperate region of the Northern Territory. The honorable member divided the Territory into three parts - tropical, semitropical, and 'temperate - and declared that, the Barclay tableland lay in the temperate portion. While  I  am satisfied that the tropical portion comprises magnificent country, with splendid water, I should like to have direct evidence that it is a fit place for white men to work in. We were there in the middle of winter, and I saw no white man doing labouring work of any magnitude in the open. I do not blame them for taking things easily, considering the tremendous heat that we experienced even in the middle of winter. </para>

                            <para>-  In some of these places there was no black labour, but the white men did not appear to be doing much work. The temperature in the Northern Territory does not vary much during summer and winter. The great difference is that in winter the south-east monsoon blows  -  a comparatively dry wind coming across the continent - while in summer the north-east monsoon, which is heavily charged with moisture, and comes across the sea, prevails. The result is that the climate is moist in summer and comparatively dry in winter, although there is not much difference in the temperature. Even in the winter, with the dry wind blowing, one could not move a dozen yards without the perspiration rolling off him. Is that a fit climate for white men to work in? As to what has been said about Australian labour going there to develop the country, we cannot get Australian labour to do our work in the more temperate parts, and what inducement will there be for men to go to the tropical portions of the Territory to work ? The men who are engaged in work that has been spoken of as likely to be carried out in the Northern Territory would be very foolish to leave the more pleasant climatic conditions of the eastern and south-eastern parts of Australia to work in the tropics. In view of the small population of Australia and the scarcity of labour now existing, I see no possibility of any big exodus of Australian labour to the Northern Territory. Labour will have to be found in some other direction, and every inducement will have to be offered for population to settle there. The Minister referred to placing Russians on the land, but people who come from the cold climate of Russia are hardly a suitable class of immigrant for those tropical regions. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid they will not find the Northern Territory a place where they will be content. As regards the Minister's leasehold propositions, I remind him that, according to his own figures, South Australia some time ago had 186,000,000 acres in the Territory under leasehold, and that that area has now come down to 96,000,000 acres. The leasehold system therefore does not appear to induce many people to take up their residence in the Territory. If we desire to see proper development there, we shall have to give the people freeholds, and I hope ] there- fore, that the Minister will not bind himself absolutely to a leasehold system. The idea of experimental farms, with a Director of Agriculture and so forth, in connexion with this country, commends itself very much to my mind. It is absolutely necessary that money should be spent in this way in order to find out what the possibilities of the Territory are. The introduction of the refrigerator has turned places where, a few years ago, it was thought that dairying could not be successfully carried on, into some of the leading dairying portions of the Commonwealth. This applies particularly to land on the Richmond River, in New South Wales, and portions of Queensland. What has been done there can be done with equal success in many portions of the Northern Territory by the introduction of refrigerators and freezing machinery generally. I hope the Minister has paid close attention to the statement of. the honorable member for Grey this morning. He showed that the Minister was starting the business from the wrong end by extending the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River first. I hope the Minister will utilize in connexion with this matter the services of men in other Departments than his own. Surely some mutual arrangement can be made between Ministers in that regard. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to cast no reflection on the officers of the External Affairs Department, but they are not fitted by training or knowledge to cope with a problem of this sort. In the other Department to which I have referred, the very men required are available. The Chief Surveyor, for instance, is one of the most capable men in Australia in connexion with this specific matter. I trust, therefore, that in the interests of the development of the Territory, which is so essential for the defence of Australia, the Minister will utilize the services of all the suitable men to be found in the Commonwealth Departments. If those now in the Departments are not able to grapple with the problem, he should try to obtain what he wants elsewhere in Australia, or even in other parts of the world. For a number of years I have been greatly concerned about this part of the Commonwealth. No one who studies the map of the world, and understands the developments which are taking place amongst the nations of the East, can fail to realize that this is the vulnerable part of Australia. If we wish to keep Australia for the white races, we must spare no time or effort to get the benefit of the best ability available to show us the way to open up, develop, and people the Territory, for only in that way can we expect to keep it against invaders. </para>

                        <para>.- I do  not think there is any matter with which we have had to deal this session of greater importance than the question of the  Northern Territory. It is, therefore, much to be regretted that we have only the last day or two of the session in which to consider it. I thoroughly endorse the view put forward by the honorable member for Grey this morning. I was greatly disappointed with the Minister's proposals last night. It is not that they were not right so far as they went, but that they did not outline a great scheme for the' development of this country. The Territory has been trifled with for many years past, but when it came into the possession of the Commonwealth .we understood that the trifling was at an end, and that we were to start out on some definite policy for its occupation and development. Circumstances arose this year which to a great extent interfered with the consideration of a policy in that direction. For instance, the attendance' of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> as Minister of External Affairs, was necessary at the Imperial Conference. That took him away during the months that he might otherwise have devoted to developing a policy for the Territory. We also know that the present Minister has been only a short time in office. I know from conversations with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> that he had in his head an idea for a policy which he was developing after his return from England. That policy must have met with the approval of the Cabinet, and it is to be regretted that we have not been given some indication of what it was. It is of no use to put off the matter from year to year. Every year now is a loss of time for which we are responsible. I regret that no proposal has been put forward this year for extending the railway from Oodnadatta at least to the MacDonnell Ranges. It would be nothing less than criminal for the Government to neglect it in another session, and I shall be much surprised if we do not find a proposal made next session in that direction. So far as the question of the gauge is concerned, the proper way to deal with that railway would be to make the earthworks and bridges sufficient for a broad gauge, but to continue the narrow gauge in order that the existing 300 or 400 miles of narrow-gauge railway and the rolling-stock now in use between Terowie and Oodnadatta may be utilized. It will be a pity if we are debarred from extending the line to the MacDonnell Ranges until we have torn up the whole of the existing railway to Oodnadatta, and substituted a broader gauge. That is an undertaking that might follow at a later period. In the meantime the principal thing is to open up and develop that country, and this can only be done by giving it railway connexion. If there was ever a territory where railways should go in advance of settlement, it is this. The MacDonnell Range country has been spoken of by all who have visited it, and especially by Professor Spencer, as a very fertile region, and by geologists as full of mineral wealth. The present railway, for which we are responsible, and the cost of the working of which we have to bear, ends practically in the desert. If a line be carried on to the MacDonnell Ranges, it will not only prove a paying undertaking, but will open up a vast area of mineral and pastoral country. It is gratifying to hear the views of honorable members, who know the Territory, confirmed by the honorable member for Illawarra, especially after the speech of the honorable member for Gwydir, who did not disclose any policy of his own, but whose policy might be put into two words - " stinking fish." </para>

                        <para>.- I regret that an important question like this should be introduced at this late stage of the session, when it is impossible to give that attention which is necessary to the solution of the great problem of founding a new settlement - a problem that no Parliament in the history of Australia has had to face. The Northern Territory forms about one-sixth of the area of Australia, and its development, by means of white labour is something that has not been attempted in any other part of the world. We shall have to introduce a special class of legislation, because we cannot expect to settle this portion of Australia on the well-worn lines followed in the southern and eastern States. I have visited the Northern Territory, and have seen the mineral belts and the areas where experiments in growing cotton and tobacco have been tried. In company with the ex-Leader of the Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> and several others, I visited, on horseback, the regions further south near the Katherine River, and the </para>

In my opinion, this part of the Northern Territory will carry the largest and densest population. The Minister laid before us proposals of an eminently practical character; but the two fundamental essentials of settlement were omitted, namely, a comprehensive scheme of immigration and the grant of freeholds to the settlers. The only hope, for the north is dense settlement and intense cultivation. </para>

                            <para>- England is about the most backward country in the world in regard to land settlement. The interjection of the Minister is unfortunate, because the one weak spot in our Anglo-Saxon civilization is that there is not the close settlement of other countries. The problem that should have been tackled in Great .Britain long since is that of the land. It is because of the landlordism in England that land values have fallen £500,000,000 or £600,000,000 in the last thirty or forty years. </para>

                            <para>- Ever since my trip to the Northern Territory, and before, I have, like other honorable members, taken a very profound interest in its future. Experience will show that the difficulties now in front of us have obtained in no other part of Australia. If the Northern Territory had been similar to other States in its grazing and agricultural capacity, no Government assistance would have been required in the initial stages. Each of the other States has been settled first by the enterprise of the people themselves, who have subsequently been assisted by the Government with public works, which began almost at once to pay. In the Northern Territory, however, the Government will have to expend money in order to induce people to settle there. The South Australian Government made heroic efforts without showing anything like reasonable headway, and their expenditure of .£3,500,000 is an instance of failure unparalleled in any other State of the Commonwealth. This is not altogether because the South Australian Government have failed to provide means of communication. Had the grazing country been such as to attract private enterprise and capital, it would have been practicable to have freezing works on the sea-board ; and a large export trade would by this time have been centred at Port Darwin, as large stock especially might be travelled reasonable distances. </para>

                    <para>The Northern Territory will have to be developed by white labour in a way to make it productive, and that can only be accomplished by providing large public works in the initial stage. No proposal is made to institute a system of irrigation and immigration, and the leasehold tenure is not likely to induce permanent settlement, as is proved in every part of the world. No country has been a success on leasehold tenure ; and where the freehold system, which is really, as we now have it, a modern institution, is in operation, we find the most intense cultivation and the latest scientific methods. As I said before, the Minister's interjection in regard to land settlement in England is most unfortunate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> in 1905, promulgated his great Imperial preference policy, there ought to have been side by side with it a complete reform in the land laws of England. We are told by the Protectionists that the fall of values in the Old Country is due to a Free Trade policy; but, in my opinion, the land tenure is one cause. Free Trade also materially contributes to this result. We have only to cross to Ireland to observe at once the effect of the two systems side by side. It is not long since the Lands Purchase Act was passed ; and during the last eight or ten years the Irish farmers have ceased, in most instances, to be the tenants of absentee landlords, and are rapidly acquiring the freehold of the land they cultivate. Four-fifths of the peasant farmers at the present time in the richest portions of Ireland are gradually acquiring the title to their lands ; and this has brought about a transformation in the methods of agriculture. There have been no more encouraging signs of permanent prosperity in Ireland during the last two hundred years than can be observed at present, owing to the statesmanlike policy of the British Government. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that it is said all over Ireland. There is more  hope of contentment and prosperity in Ireland now than there has been for the last two centuries. Nations, it has been proved, can only permanently progress after a system of freehold tenure has been established as is proved by the history of France and of Germany. In the latter country, with poor agricultural land, very little headway could be made with cultivation until the German Parliament established freehold tenure throughout the Empire. However, we need only to refer to New Zealand, where leasehold was established at the commencement of the closer settlement movement some years ago. In the Dominion, 75 or 8o per cent, of the cultivators desire to acquire freeholds, and a majority in the House of Representatives is pledged to make these titles freehold. Where land is scarce and desirable, the people are glad to take it under any title, but after they have made it productive, and placed on it permanent improvements, they wish to get the most secure title possible. Coming back to Germany, that country has made immense strides in agriculture during the last thirty years, and so, too, has France. This is due almost entirely to the security of tenure which the people of those countries enjoy. In France 48 per cent., or nearly half, of the cultivators own the soil which they till. </para>

                            <para>- Where the land is mortgaged it has probably been given as a security to the Government, under the Credit Foncier system, and there need be no fear as to the ability of the owners to ultimately redeem it. One of the most extraordinary features in the progress of Germany ,has been the agricultural development of the country ; whilst people are leaving the congested manufacturing centres, the agricultural population is increasing. There, 35 per cent, of the people own the land that they cultivate. Great Britain is the foremost country in the world in commerce and manufacture, but only 10 per cent, .of the farmers of England own their own holdings. Because Great Britain has failed to solve the land problem, she is importing to-day probably twice as much as she would need to import were her soil used to the best advantage. In Great Britain the cultivator stands to the landlord in the same position as it is proposed that he shall stand in the Northern Territory towards the Crown; but the experience of New Zealand shows that even Crown leaseholds are not considered satisfactory. The conditions to be faced in the Northern Territory are most difficult, and yet it is proposed to give only leasehold tenure, which will not attract desirable immigrants wishing permanent possession. </para>

Every citizen, of course, is responsible for his share of the cost of government. The Minister thinks that railway construction is most necessary for the development of the Northern Territory. Something else is wanted as well. There is already a line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, a distance of 145 miles, which has done nothing to induce settlement. </para>

                    <para>What is needed is an extensive system of water conservation for the purposes of irrigation. In the Northern Territory; the rain falls chiefly in December, January, and February, Port Darwin getting from 60 tf&gt; 70 inches, and the rainfall steadily decreases until it is only 19 or 20 inches in the district 400 or 500 miles to the south of that place. Such a rainfall; confined chiefly to three months of the year, is not sufficient for dairying under these conditions. We should take example by what has been done in India. There are many books on Indian irrigation, but that published about twenty years ago by the Leader of the Opposition has been described by the most eminent authority on irrigation in Australia as being the most able, exhaustive and complete on the subject. The Indian irrigation system has grown since that book was written, and there are now 43,000,000 acres of land under irrigation in that country. Of this area, about 1 7,000,000 acres are served by Government canals, 2,000,000 by private canals, 6,000,000 acres by tanks, 12,000,000 acres by wells, and 5,000,000 acres in other ways.; </para>

Jute, for the making of bags, and hemp, for the making of rope, now grown in India, ought to be grown successfully in the Northern Territory. The northern part of the Northern Territory is mostly mineral country, but between the belts of mineral land are districts in which it should be possible to grow cotton - we saw cotton growing wild - and there are places where coffee can be grown. On the Adelaide River, and on some of the other rivers, we saw large flats which could be irrigated and used for rice-growing. </para>

                            <para>- We certainly saw the ruins of some coffee plantations, but in the work of developing a country many experiments have to be made, and some are sure to fail. There seems to be a fear on the part of some persons that although we have in the Northern Territory land suitable for the production of cotton and rice, We cannot hope to cultivate it in successful competition with the cheap coloured labour of other countries. I have, however, sufficient faith in the genius and industry of the Britisher to believe that we are capable of devising machinery that will enable us to cultivate these tracts of country, and to harvest such crops in a way that will enable us to compete with cheap labour. We can grow both cotton and rice in the Territory, and we have also there large belts of auriferous country suitable for the production of jute and hemp in large quantities. I feel confident that Targe areas will be devoted to the production of such crops, and that the inventive genius of the Britisher will enable us to compete with the cheap labour productions of other countries. Below that belt - along the Roper, the Katherine, the Daly, the Adelaide, and the Victoria Rivers - we have splendid opportunities to store immense quantities of water which would enable us to irrigate large areas of land on which progressive and closely-packed settlements could be established. We have opportunities there to carry on the dairying and other industries, and there is no reason why we should not be able to have large freezing works busily engaged there. It will be necessary, however, for us to grow artificial fodders to maintain sheep further north than they are at present. There seems to be a good deal of misapprehension as to the reason why only a comparatively small number of stock is carried in the Northern Territory. As a matter of fact most of that stock is carried by areas some hundreds of miles south of Port Darwin, where the rainfall is less than it is in the north, and where the fodder is consequently sweeter and more nutritious. The denser settlement of the Territory will take place north of that area. It will be within the area served by the rivers, some of which I had the privilege of seeing when I visited the Northern Territory, and which are in every way suitable for vast irrigation schemes. It is unfortunate that the Minister, before discussing the question of policy, has not seen fit to engage the most eminent engineer available, and to instruct him to traverse the Territory and report upon the whole future of water storage and irrigation there. </para>

                            <para>- Let him appoint whatever experts are necessary. We have in Victoria a gentleman who might well be appointed to such a position, and there are also in other States engineers experienced in irrigation works. Let us secure the services of the most eminent engineer, and obtain from him a comprehensive report as to the possibilities of water storage and irrigation within the Territory. The fodder now grown in parts where the rainfall is very heavy, and takes place within the space of a few weeks is altogether too rank for the fattening of stock, and it will be necessary to sow down, after cultivation, large tracts of country with artificial grasses. In that way alone shall we be able to secure a large population, and the growth of artificial fodders must be promoted by means of large irrigation and water-storage schemes. The Minister should, first of all, have brought down a report as to the possibilities of water storage and irrigation, not only along the large rivers, but, as in India, by means of tanks and wells. There are large subterranean water supplies in various parts of the Territory, and if wells were sunk, and the necessary machinery erected, we should be able in that way to supply many thousands of acres as cheaply as could be done by means of river irrigation schemes. When I was travelling through Queensland I went from Townsville to a place called Ayr, where a sugar plantation is being carried on by Messrs. Drysdale Brothers. There I saw water drawn by machinery from lagoons, and also from1 the sand by means of spear pipes, and in that way these gentlemen were carrying on a very successful system of irrigation. </para>

                        <para>. - I confess to a feeling of disappointment that we have not had submitted to us a vigorous, policy of development in regard to the Northern Territory. Whether we have made a good or a bad bargain in taking over that Territory, the obligation of developing it, and of bringing it into close communication with the south, is undoubtedly imposed upon us, and it was because I took that view that I supported the transfer to the Commonwealth. Apart altogether from the peculiar advantages that the Territory may offer us, as the open door to Australia from the East, it must be controlled by the National Parliament. For that, if for no other reason, it is above all things necessary that it should be brought into such close contact as modern methods will allow with the southern parts of Australia, where the population is chiefly settled. Even if we never succeed in populating the country, that work is necessary so that we may have ready communication with a vulnerable point of our coastline. For these reasons I deplore the failure of the Minister to suggest any vigorous step in advance. I was one of those who visited the Northern Territory some two or three years ago, and whilst I have not one word to say against an extension of the existing railway to the Katherine, as proposed by the Minister, I recognise that it is just , at that point that we get into the good country. The proposed extension will certainly be a step in the right direction, and the Ministry are certainly not remaining idle in this matter. I realize that the preliminary steps proposed are absolutely essential, and that action is being taken to explore the country, and to provide for scientific investigation. We have on these Estimates an item of .£3,000 in respect of exploratory work, and also an item of £2,000 for scientific research, whilst provision is made for special expenditure amounting to £5,000. All these are necessary preliminaries, and it is quite possible that only by superhuman effort could more have been done. I have my own doubts, however, as to the best having been done to develop the Territory, and I believe that, apart from the outstanding obligation to link up the Territory with the rest of Australia, that Territory is going to pay. As I have already mentioned, whether the bargain be a bad or a good one, we must shoulder the responsibilities associated with it. I am inclined to think, however, that we have not made a bad bargain, and that the Territory is a land of great potentialities. Although, like the honorable member for Gwydir, I was a member of the parliamentary party that visited the Northern Territory, I do not profess consequently to know all about the country. At the most, I do not suppose that we covered more than 300 miles in a direct line, and we could rarely see more than 100 yards on either side of us. We saw something of the mineral resources of the Territory, but there is yet much to learn concerning them, and I, like the honorable member for Parramatta, have had to add to my knowledge of. the Territory by reading. I am satisfied that we have there resources that are, at least, going to pay very good interest on the money we are expending, even if they do not make it possible to thickly populate the country. I hope that we shall be able to make the Northern Territory not only an outpost of, but a very important section of, our community. The honorable member for Gwydir is much prejudiced against it, and has not a good word to say for the whole of that vast area. He went so far as to assert that_the natives were perishing, and that even native animals were dying out, because they could not get sufficient to sustain themselves. Unfortunately, the natives are dying out only where civilization has reached them. Further out things are much better. The honorable member made far too much of what little race suicide is practised among the natives. One feature the honorable member overlooked was the abundance of wallabies in the scrub. The best answer to the attitude adopted by the honorable member is the fact that the swamp buffalo of India which were brought there some forty years ago and left at Port Elizabeth by the settlers who vacated the place, have multiplied by hundreds of thousands, and roam the whole of the far north as they do the American prairies. Herbivorous animals of that sort will not exist and multiply in a drought-stricken country. If the country had been as bad as the honorable member portrayed it, these beasts would not have increased so enormously. An immense trade has been conducted in hides for many years, and still the animals are there in plenty. This proves that the country cannot be a desert waste. The honorable member for Wimmera emphasized the necessity for freehold tenure and irrigation. Irrigation is a good thing, but in view of the rainfall of the far north, there is less need for it there than in some of the more arid portions down south. The rainfall is quite good enough to warrant considerably closer settlement in the north than now exists, and later we may deal with the irrigation question, but the Erst and foremost essential is a railway. Particularly when dealing with a new country, the very best system possible is one of long leases at nominal rents. The honorable member for Wimmera sought to buttress his argument by instancing the fact that the leasehold system had proved a failure in older countries, but he forgot to point out that that was a system of leasehold grafted upon freehold. In those cases the country was freehold, the Crown first granting a freehold title to certain large land-holders, who, in turn, exploited the rest of the people, making them pay dearly for the privilege of using the land as tenants. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there are objections to a leasehold system, one being that values are likely to increase, and the first lessee to become a sort of middleman, appropriating the unearned increment and getting big rent from sub-lessees. That exists in New Zealand to-day, but over and above all is the fact that, with a leasehold system, the Crown comes into its own periodically, and that is a good thing when the Crown means the people, as it does in a Democracy. The honorable member was dealing with a state of things that led to the ancient feudal system, and that, in France, culminated in the Revolution. That is a condition we desire to avoid. It is very difficult to control the freehold system. Moses was amongst the first to try it with his year of jubilee, when the land reverted to the original owners. We could vastly improve the present system of tenure, and, if we are to maintain our position as the owners of the Northern Territory, our best plan is to give long leases at nominal rents. Let the men who go pioneering there have twenty years' terms if they like, and let the Commonwealth run the risk of local developments putting land values up against it. In any case, that will be better than alienating the land outright, and allowing all the publicly-created value of the future to go into individual pockets, instead of returning to the people as a whole. The policy I advocate is safer and sounder, and will hasten, rather than retard, development. It is cheaper for a man to take up large areas of land at a nominal rent, with security of tenure and tenant-right to improvements, than to pay capital value for the land, exhaust his funds in becoming a freeholder, and borrow to make improvements. With the Crown as landlord, I would much rather take up land in the former than in the latter way. There is no comparison between the advantages of the two systems to a man who is genuinely out to use the land. Of course, it is a case of freehold every time for the man who is out to secure the benefit of the publicly-created value. While the freehold system exists, those of us who believe in leasehold must accept it, but that will not prevent us from advocating the introduction of the leasehold system when dealing with new areas, as these are. The honorable member for Wimmera referred to the rainfall as being from 19 to 20 inches up to 500 miles inland. I believe that is substantially correct, and therefore the possibilities of the country, much of which is good, virgin soil, are tremendous. </para>

At any rate, it will give enough water for the settler to do a great deal in the way of close culture, especially with the system of dry farming now prevailing. Connexion with the south is absolutely essential for our safety, apart altogether from other economic aspects, and I regret that the Government have not been bold enough to raise as much money as is required for the purpose. 'They are raising ,£130,000 merely to pay interest. It would be much better to raise £1,000,000 to put down the line, and so get something back for our money. The Barclay tablelands alone would show such an increase in value as would return interest on the money expended on a line of that sort. In" any case, good or bad, win or lose, we have to do it.

                    <para>I wish to discuss our position in the Pacific, and our control, such as it is, of conditions obtaining in the Islands. The conditions in the Pacific demand the close attention of the Commonwealth. Australia, as a Commonwealth, is very different from Australia as States. We speak as a Commonwealth with, at any rate, the voice of a small nation, and as part of the British nation, we can speak with a very strong voice indeed. There is what is as yet only a small cloud on the political horizon in the shape of the encroachment of Japanese throughout the Pacific. I am not a scaremonger, nor do I share any racial hatred of the nations of the East. I rather admire the Japanese and the methods they are adopting to secure the ultimate domination of the Pacific. If Japan is to become a great power, it must be by achieving control of the Pacific, and she is doing this in. a diplomatic, well-thought-out, strategic way which will, perhaps, not become apparent to the world until it is too late, so far as we are concerned, to remedy the evil.

                        <para>Not long ago a movement was started in New Caledonia for a transfer from French to Australian control, and this had the support of many French residents, who had formed the opinion, that a change of this kind would be in the best interests of the colony.

                    <para class="block">I heartily concur in those statements. In view of Japan's position, our Government should take some definite steps to approach) the British Government with a view to secure some say as to the nature of the population of the Pacific Islands, particularly the New Hebrides. Japan is extending her tentacles throughout the Pacific, and we can counter only in regard to the New Hebrides, as our sphere is limited. According to the census of 1900, there were in Hawaii, out of a population of 154,000 no fewer than 61,100 Japanese. That is one of the centres of the Pacific - I suppose the most desirable point from which to direct operations, and the best naval depot in the whole of the ocean. To-day, it is estimated that actually one-third of the total population of 240,000 in Hawaii is Japanese. I am now pointing out what I conceive to be a deep-laid strategic plan to secure domination of the Pacific, to which end Japan must annex Hawaii as a naval dep6t. Amongst the Japanese there are 30,000 trained soldiers, who go as coolies, and do any sorts of work, apparently with the full connivance of their Government. There is the full knowledge on the part of Japanthat^ when the time comes, and the word is given, there will be in these centres men who can be called to arms at  a  moment's notice. They are, in fact, at present an unarmed army ready to strike whenever Japan is ready. I connect these facts with New Caledonia because events in both places indicate the trend of the Japanese policy. New Caledonia is only 800 miles east of Queensland, and 1,000 miles north of New Zealand ; and the nickel mines there already employ some 2,000 Japanese, with the possibility, according to information at hand, that next year another 1,000 will arrive. The nickel mines, although in a French possession, are largely owned by British shareholders ; and this is another evidence of the fact that big vested interests seem always prepared to sacrifice their country for the sake of profit. Hawaii is sold to Japan in order that those who are specially interested in the cultivation of sugar and so forth may have cheap labour, and the same sort of thing is going on in New Caledonia. I admit there are many public spirited men who do not approve of this state of affairs ; and I am glad to say that the Americans are likening up and fortifying Hawaii. We must take up an attitude similar to that of Japan ; and, if possible, acquire control of New Caledonia. A special commissioner from the New Zealand <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> was recently sent to New Caledonia; and he reports that some 2,300 more Japanese are expected during the next twelve months - that is more than I understand - and that many of these are engineers, bridge-builders, masons, carpenters, and other skilled men. New Caledonia has a fine harbor and a coal-field, and would fit in very well with the general scheme on the part of Japan for the control of the Pacific. If she can secure New Caledonia by peaceful annexation, she will find herself, when the time is ripe, in an almost invulnerable position. These and her other schemes may lead to her domination of the Pacific, and of Australia. For these reasons, I urge the Government to take some cognisance of the suggestion made by the <inline font-style="italic">Morning Post,</inline> and see whether, through diplomatic channels, Great Britain and France cannot arrange to bring New Caledonia, and all the New Hebrides, under the purview of the Commonwealth, and thus enable us to thwart what is undoubtedly the intention of that power, which, of all the Powers, is likely to be the enemy of Australia in the future. </para>

                        <para>I am certainly not satisfied with the policy submitted by the Minister; and, unless something more is intended than what has been indicated, I think it is a pity we took the Territory over. Primarily, at any rate, the leaders in the development of this portion of Australia should be Australian born and bred men. I believe it would be most advantageous if we could have 100 or 200 prospectors, well led by geologists or mining managers, to explore the mineral areas, because the discovery of some well-defined gold-bearing reefs would lead more than anything else to the attraction of population. If the mineral resources are to be developed, we shall have to take steps similar to those taken in Western Australia. In that State investors have not been content to remain at Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie, but, from time to time, have sent out bands of prospectors, with the result that further fields have been discovered. There are in the Northern Territory similar belts of country to those which are found to be gold-bearing in Western Australia, and similar methods will have to be adopted. I hope that the Minister, as an old miner, will realize that one of the best ways to give a fillip to population will be to send out prospectors in the way I have suggested. The pastoralist and agricultural interests of the Territory would be best served by sending there those men who have assisted in the development of north-west Queensland, western New South Wales, and even portions of the Territory itself. It would, I think, prove a profitable enterprise if we were to spend even a considerable amount of money in sending out such men as leaders in the promotion of pastoral and agricultural interests. As to the railway, I should like to see it constructed, not only from the Oodnadatta end, but from the Pine Creek end towards the centre of the Territory. I am glad to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Francis,</inline> the engineer appointed, in addition to his qualifications as a railway expert, knows something of engineering in connexion with cool storage. This gentleman had to do, I understand, with the establishment of cool storage works in connexion with the railways, and I hope his varied qualifications will prove of advantage. I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera that the establishment of freezing works furnishes one of the best means of developing this part of Australia.

' The Northern Territory, magnificent as are its possibilities, must be developed on progressive lines ; and the Government will be largely judged at the next elections by their policy in this connexion. I hope that, in their own interests, and in the interests of the country generally, apart altogether from party, a vigorous developmental policy will be pursued. The Northern Territory is contiguous to some very promising markets amongst the Eastern races, which are now beginning to adopt Western methods in dress and diet. We should be able to send our commercial agents to the East, and, I believe, develop a great trade. The Northern Territory contains country tropica,], sub-.tropical, and temperate, where almost anything can be produced. With those wonderful possibilities, it would be a lasting disgrace to this Parliament if we did not insist on the Government inaugurating a bold policy, such as I shall be always found ready to support. </para>

                        <para>. - There is one suggestion not yet made, which would, I am convinced, prove the solution of this great problem. Honorable members opposite have now an opportunity ready-made to hand, to demonstrate to the world the practicability and beneficence of their policy of State Socialism. Here is a magnificent Territory.^ as large as two or more Continental countries, and there are, I believe, some  6,000,000  Socialists in the world. What the Northern Territory requires is population ; and I suggest that the Minister of Home Affairs, who is a strong Socialist, should invite the whole of the  6,000,000  of his brother Socialists to immigrate. They could administer the Territory entirely in consonance with their own doctrines, and give an object-lesson as to the way in which all government should be carried on in connexion with production, distribution, commerce, and so forth. The Minister of External Affairs, assisted by the Minister of Home Affairs, might get these millions of people to the Territory, and show the world how a Socialistic State should be run. This is the grand opportunity for which Socialists have been waiting so long. They have nothing to do but accept the invitation of the Government. They can then occupy the Territory, pass their own laws for their government, draw on their own people for revenue, produce for the common good and not for profit, and nationalize the means of. production, distribution, and exchange. Students of economics in all countries would view the experiment with the greatest interest, and its success when demonstrated would induce the benighted peoples elsewhere to follow the shining examples set to them, and adopt the Socialistic methods preached by honorable members opposite. The experimental Socialistic failures of the centuries that have passed have not convinced those honorable members of the futility of their doctrines, and they should therefore take this opportunity to demonstrate the practicability of their theories. It would be a great relief to the rest of the world if the  6,000,000  Socialists in it could be brought together and put down in the Northern Territory. </para>

The opening of the Panama Canal is now a matter of months only, and when it comes the commercial importance of the Pacific will be very different from what it has been in the' past. As the relations between Great Britain and her chief Continental trade rivals are now friendly, the attempt should be made to come to an amicable understanding with them touching the control of the Pacific, and particularly with France in regard to the control of the New Hebrides.

Australia and New Zealand should be consulted by the British authorities, with, a view to securing the preponderance of British influence and control in the Pacific. The rivals of Great Britain are gradually extending their outposts, and in the near future foreign naval bases will probably be dotted in the track of our commerce all over the Pacific. This is a matter to which I have on many occasions invited attention, but to which the significance by the Government is not attached which its importance demands. If we wait much longer it will have become too late to prevent many groups of islands or individual islands passing under foreign flags. I hope that we shall long continue on the most friendly footing with the great naval powers of the world ; but trade rivalry is so keen that the present understanding is not likely to continue indefinitely, and while it is yet possible to do so, we should take every precaution against future danger. I hope that the Government will give some thought to this matter. There should be something in the nature of a Commonwealth Empire policy for the Pacific. </para>

                            <para>- The British authorities appear not to be thoroughly alive to the seriousness of the question. It is increasingly apparent that the great naval battles of the future will be fought on the Pacific Ocean, and we should do all we can to insure the continuance of our safety, and the effective policing of what will shortly be one of the busiest ocean highways of British and Australasian commerce. I wish to know whether the Government has considered the advisability of increasing the salary of the High Commissioner. Those of us who have recently visited Great Britain are painfully aware that his present remuneration is inadequate. I hope that in framing the Supplementary Estimates the Government will take the matter into its consideration, and, recognising that the prestige of the Commonwealth requires that its representative in London shall be given a salary which will enable him to maintain his position in a manner worthy of its importance, will increase his. remuneration. </para>

                        <para>- - Some of the speakers on the Northern Territory question have been optimistic, and others pessimistic ; the truth probably lies in the mean between the extremes. South Australia undertook the development of the Northern Territory forty years ago, in a spirit of the brightest optimism, with the result that the Territory is now practically unoccupied, being notable chiefly for the smallness of its population and the largeness of its debt. I was a member of the parliamentary party that visited the Northern Territory, and I endeavoured to see as much of it as the facilities -afforded us .would allow. As the result of that visit, I have come to the conclusion that two great causes prevented the consummation of South Australia's hope with respect to the settlement and the development, of the country. The first was its endeavour to carry on the work of settlement by Asiatic labour. The presence of Asiatics in large numbers, who went there not to assist in building up a progressive community, but to get as much as they could, and to leave as quickly as possible, prevented white labour taking any substantial part in the work of development. The hopes of those who were engaged in exploiting the Northern Territory by means of Asiatic labour have been slowly dissipated during the last ten years. Asiatic labour is gradually being reduced, and the Commonwealth is in the happy position of being able to enter upon the development of the Territory on the basis of white labour. My observations have led me to the conclusion that it is possible to develop the country only by white, rather than by Asiatic labour. </para>

                    <para>The next barrier to the progress of the Territory under the control of South Australia was that in order to encourage the introduction of capital, the State Government offered land for pastoral, agricultural, and mining purposes on exceedingly easy terms, and upon long leases. Not only were the rentals very low, but the conditions were most elastic. In the hope that the Territory would soon carry a large population, a number of men speculated in agricultural, mining, and grazing areas to such an extent as to shut out the late comer, and to block a good deal of settlement that would otherwise have taken place. The Minister has intimated that there has recently been a considerable reduction of the area held under pastoral leases, but that reduction is in respect of the more speculative leases that do not cover a very long tenure. In some cases, leases extending over forty years, were granted by the South Australian Government, and the rental conditions were very easy. These leases may be divided into three classes. The first comprise those in respect of which there is a uniform rental over the whole period of forty years, and they cover an area of 64,400 square miles. The second are also for a term of forty years, and have yet at least twenty-nine years to run. They are subject to reappraisement every seven years, and carry a rental of from 6d. to 2s. per square mile. The area embraced by them is 12,300 square miles. The third class of leases are somewhat similar the only difference being that the rentals range from is. to 4s. per square mile, and they cover an area of 10,400 square miles. In other words, we have a total of 87,000 square miles of pastoral land held at very low rentals, and covered by leases which have yet from twenty-nine to thirty-five years to run. A great part of the land so held is practically unoccupied. Some portions are used for grazing purposes, but there are no fences, and very little improvement in the way of water storage. Cattle are allowed to roam over them at will, and the holders practically depend upon nature to provide for whatever stocking they have done upon those areas. By far the greater portion of this land is held, not so much for grazing as for speculative purposes, and if the Government provide facilities that will attract a big population, the holders of these leases have the incremental right to these large areas, and hope to secure a very substantial profit on their speculations. I strongly urge the Minister to see to what extent these leases have been taken up for speculative rather than for developmental purposes, and to what extent they have been, and are likely to operate, against legitimate settlement. If he finds that they have been, and are calculated to be, detrimental to the progress of the Terri- ' tory, he should certainly remove the causes that have made for failure in the past, and which are likely to handicap his efforts in the future. I am told that this question of monopoly applies not only to grazing, but to mineral, areas. Within recent times the South Australian Government has given some attention to the remedying of this set of grievances, so that they are not so pronounced as they were some years ago, when development might have been expected. These difficulties, after all, are man-made difficulties, which the Minister can remedy. </para>
                    <para>I agree with the honorable member for Angas that if the' Territory is to be developed it must have reasonable transit facilities. It must have railway and shipping facilities, and market facilities in the direction of the East. At the same time, I do not agree with those who think that the Minister should have come along and, as if by the waving of a magic wand, changed in a moment the whole face of the position. It would not be wise to make a big appropriation to carry out at this stage what might be thought to be suitable methods of development. The Minister is well-advised, in view of the substantial failures that have taken place, in " ganging " warily. He should be sure of his ground, and attempt development only along those lines that experience has shown to be successful. The Government should, first of all, extend the Oodnadatta railway to the MacDonnell Ranges, where, I am informed, there are good pastoral lands, that might be developed if railway communication were established. At present the Oodnadatta railway terminates practically in the desert, and if it were extended as I have suggested, it might contribute something towards its support. It is certainly an experiment that the Minister would be warranted in taking in hand for the purpose of developing the Territory. Then, again, in the north the Minister proposes to extend the existing railway to the Katherine River. That project is also worthy of consideration. So far as my knowledge of the country goes, it would seem to me that that line would traverse the western portion of the Territory, and if it is intended to continue it as part of the main trunk to link up with the Oodnadatta railway, there may be justification for it. On the other hand, it would leave out of account a considerable area that has been highly, recommended by explorers and travellers as worth development. I refer more particularly to the Barclay table-lands. Whilst the Minister has provided for the western portion of the Territory, he should also consider the desirableness of making an extension that will tap the Barclay table-lands. I believe that in the years to come, if this Territory is to be developed, there must be two railway connexions - one going through the Katherine River country, and linking up the MacDonnell Ranges plateau with the Oodnadatta-Port Augusta line; and the other branching off from about Pine Creek, and extending eastward through the Barclay table-lands and down through the western part of Queensland. This would give every promise of successfully developing a big tract of country, and be of splendid strategic value in the defence of the eastern and northern parts of Australia. These matters are well worthy of the consideration of the Minister. I commend him for not rushing to the House with a flaring scheme in the nature of a big advertisement of the Territory. He is right in feeling his way, and endeavouring to discover the lines on which substantial developmental work can be done. When he discovers those lines he will be able to work along them. </para>

He has to work out the different schemes as they present themselves, and obtain a knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of the country. As the honorable member for Gwydir pointed out, one of the great natural disadvantages is the presence of the white ant, one of the biggest pests I know of. </para>

                    <para>The Territory was a white elephant to South Australia, which struggled manfully with it before handing it over to the Commonwealth. I shall still regard it, until its problems have been faced and solved, as a white elephant to the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth cannot devise better means of dealing with it than South Australia did, I fear that our experience will be merely a repetition of the experience of that State. I should have been, much stronger in my opposition to the Commonwealth taking the Territory over had I not recognised that its development was an Australian, and not merely a South Australian, work, and that the burden of developing it should be spread over the whole Commonwealth. Each State should bear its fair share of the cost, because it is part and parcel of Australia, and we cannot allow it to continue a no-man's-land. It faces the East, and is the back door of Australia. Unless we occupy it I am sure that the Asiatic races, who are now feeling the pressure of population, will be compelled to turn their eyes towards it. Nothing could be more disastrous to the future success of Australia as a white man's country than to have a considerable portion of it occupied by the coloured races of the East. </para>
                    <para>I would specially direct the attention of the Minister to the necessity for bringing the possibilities of Australia more prominently and generally before the great British public. We want population of the right sort, and I am satisfied that the Mother Country has ample material to meet all our needs in that direction. All that is necessary is to bring Australia and its opportunities prominently before the people whom we want. I was greatly surprised on my recent visit to England to discover how little was known of Australia. What little was known was rather a caricature than an actual representation of our position. Canada loomed very largely in the eyes of the British public, being extensively advertised all over the Kingdom and throughout the press. South Africa was behind Canada in that respect, but considerably ahead of Australia, which was almost a <inline font-style="italic">terra incognita.</inline> New Zealand was known quite as widely as the Commonwealth. </para>

On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid has neither the wealth nor the monetary interest in Australia that Lord Strathcona has in Canada. He therefore cannot be expected to do the same amount of private work and private advertising. </para>

                    <para>When in the Old Country, I desired to have general' news of Australia, but found it most difficult to get. The news that did appear in the English papers was, I understand, largely compiled by the Commonwealth officers, and related more particularly to immigration. I think we can create a wider interest in Australia that would help us commercially. Some scheme might be devised to transmit cablegrams of general Australian news, not necessarily political, to the Old Country, and have them inserted in the press. In that connexion, the present Government have done substantial work by subsidizing a press cable service here. This has been in existence for about twelve months, and a return was recently placed upon the table giving the result of its operations. It had to face, at the outset, the strong opposition of an old-established and exclusive cable service controlled by a strong combination in Australia. The return shows that the new service is participated in by ten or eleven dailies, five large bi-weekly and tri-weekly papers, and seventy-nine or eighty country papers, connected with the Country Press Co-operative Association ; while, owing to the cablegrams not being copyrighted, a number of other associations avail themselves of them. Consequently, a considerable amount of news is being distributed by this means that could not be distributed previously ; but one great factor which must not be lost sight of is the consequent development of the business passing over the Pacific Cable. The Pacific Cable has been in existence for about ten years. It was constructed by a combination of the Mother Country, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The excess of working expenses over earnings amounts to about £60,000 per annum, towards which the Commonwealth has to contribute ,£20,000. As a result of the subsidy, there has been a great increase in the number of words sent through as press messages. For the year ending 31st December, 1909, the number of press words sent over the Pacific cable was 21,631, whereas for the year ending 30th September, 19 11, the number was 463,7261 or an increase, as the outcome of the subsidy, of 442,091 words. In the case of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, tha number of words sent during the twelve months ending 31st December, 1909, was 218,467, and for the year ending 30th September, 1911, the number was 220,214, or an increase of only 1,747. These figures, I take it, are ample justification of the subsidy, prior to which the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-Herald</inline> combination did very little of their business over the Pacific cable. The advent of competition, however, has increased the volume of the messages sent over the cable on behalf of those newspapers. The subsidy, instead of representing a loss to the Government, means, so I am credibly informed, a gain. The Government pay ,£2,000 per annum, by way of subsidy, and are receiving, as a result of the business done, something like £2,200 per annum. The Pacific Cable Board has had to fight against the established Eastern Extension Telegraph Company from the very first, and there is still strong hostility shown. A number of engagements have been entered into with the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-Herald</inline> Cable Combine, and these do not terminate for two or three years. For instance, there is an arrangement with the New Zealand press, representing two newspaper agencies, and several newspaper proprietors, who, under heavy penalties, are not permitted to take any news from any other source. The increase in business over the Pacific line has not been merely in press telegrams, but also in private messages ; the payment of the subsidy, and the publicity thereby given, having made the advantages of this line of communication widely known. In view of the development in connexion with the Pacific cable, I suggest that the Government should consider the advisableness of increasing the subsidy. </para>
                    <para>The other evening I brought under the notice of the Prime Minister  the necessity not only of linking up with New Zealand, but also of linking up the Mother Country over the Atlantic. I then pointed out that a number of lines across the Atlantic had been syndicated to such an extent that there were now really only two competitors, which might at any time be amalgamated. If this octopus scheme be completed, the Commonwealth will be simply at the mercy of a huge cable Trust. That, of course, is undesirable in the extreme; and there ought to be an All-Red line not only between Australia and Canada, but across the Atlantic to England. This would give us an All-Red route, not merely in name, but in actuality ; and I hope that the Government will take this into their most earnest consideration, and lay before us in this regard a liberal progressive policy. </para>

                        <para>-- 1 regret very much that any honorable member should cry " stinking fish" with regard to the Northern Territory,' or any other part of Australia, as the honorable member for Gwydir did to-day. In my opinion, there are great possibilities in this Territory, in which there is a large proportion of good country that should be populated at the earliest possible moment. The Minister and the Government have before them an enormous task; but I hope the honorable gentlemen will face it courageously. We have been told that this question will be dealt with on non-party lines, and that is just as it should be, and as I think it has been, with the exception of some indications of Socialism, which I venture to suggest must prove a failure if tried. All experiments of that kind have hitherto been disastrous; and it would hardly be safe for us to take the advice which was, jokingly, I think, offered by the honorable member for Lang. As to the white ants, I do not' regard them as forming a very serious pest, if their habits are properly understood ; though, of course, they are a nuisance. At any rate, in spite of white ants, Queensland has developed, and is still developing; and there is no reason why the Northern Territory should not show similar progress. The policy outlined by the Minister last night seemed to me so feeble as to offer no promise of real development. We have to grapple with practical facts, and the difficulties to be overcome will require a much bolder policy. Freezing works, which are very good in their way, and an experimental farm, seem to sum up the whole scheme of the Government, though the Minister did say that in the distant future he proposed to consider railway construction when the Commissioner had reported. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable member is wrong. There is a great outcry for freehold land, and the demand is being met as rapidly as possible. Except in a few isolated instances where large areas have been available, leaseholds have not been sought after to any extent. We should enter upon a bold railway policy. The construction of the transcontinental line may be too costly to be entered upon at once, but the country should be connected by the shortest routes with markets. Much of it is like a good deal of the western parts of Queensland, country capable of carrying a great deal of stock. Some years ago the Queensland pastoralists were almost ruined by droughts, it being impossible for them to get their stock away to other pastures. This trouble will not occur again, because the various trunk railway lines of Queensland are being linked up by a line which will serve practically all the country from Bourke to Camooweal, and if the Northern Territory were connected by an extension from the Pine Creek line to Camooweal, it would have an outlet for its stock and produce, and in the eastern States there would be a very good market. </para>

                            <para>- No. If the construction of the transcontinental line is necessary to serve that country, it must be undertaken, and I shall be willing to assist in tapping every part of the Territory which is worth tapping, but we should commence with the best. My experience leads me to think that the coastal districts are the best. The sum of £2,000, provided for wells on stock routes, is inadequate, and I should not have complained had the Government asked for a sum ten times as large. Pastoralists should be able to travel their stock from droughty districts to places where pasture can be obtained. We should not hesitate to spend money freely, though wisely, on the development of the Northern, Territory. If we do not, the country will be quickly overrun with rabbits and prickly pear. I do not disparage the value of the mineral wealth of the Territory, but the pastoralists must lead the way in the development of the country, and should be given every encouragement. I do not say that it should be made possible to speculate with the land, but its use should be encouraged in every way. Following pastoral occupation will come closer settlement, until, at last, the country will be put to the best use of which it is possible. As the population of Australia increases, the demand for meat increases. Cattle country is now being taken largely for other purposes, and it is necessary .to open up areas for the, cattle-breeder elsewhere. Such areas are to be found in the Northern Territory. We might also turn our attention to the cultivation there of tropical fruits, and cotton, as a subsidiary industry. On a small area we should produce enough for our own requirements. I wish to know why there is no vote for the British Association for the Advancement of Science? Last year we voted £1,000. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Calare has spoken about the advertising of Australian possibilities in Great Britain and elsewhere, but the Minister will be well-advised to have regard to the interests of our exporters also. We are a large exporting community, and depend greatly upon our foreign markets. We desire other markets than those we now have, in order to have a larger demand to meet, and the Minister will be well-advised if he sees that our products are advertised judiciously, but freely, in other parts of the world, but particularly in Great Britain. I understand that an agent is to be appointed to represent our meat industry in London, and another officer might be appointed to look after other Australian produce, or the scope of the duties of the meat agent might be widened so that he could do so. Many false rumours are circulated by our competitors to damage the reputation of our products. The Irish people protect themselves from injury of this nature by employing a man on the spot, whose duty it is to follow up every adverse report with regard to their produce, and sheet it home. We might do the same thing, so that our produce might be fairly dealt with. From a pretty close connexion with the industry, I know that 90 per cent, of our butter loses its identity on the London market, only about 10 per cent being sold as Australian butter. The Government goes to a lot of expense in grading this butter, but the benefit is lost to the producers, because the dis tributers in London hide its identity.! As to what was said by the honorable member for Lang regarding our concern with the Pacific, the Minister should lose no time in making representations to the Mother Country which will safeguard British interests there in every way. Some remarkable stories have been in circulation of late, which, if not tending to make one uneasy, should open one's eyes to the fact that something is happening. Where there is smoke there is fire, and it is necessary to see that those whom we have as near neigh'bours shall not be undesirable neighbours.. </para>

                        <para>. - To the friends of the Northern Territory, the debate that has taken place in these, the closing hours of the session, will be a source of much gratification ; and I am sure that honorable members will not regret the interest they have displayed in this question. Much, has been said regarding the failure of the South Australian Government to develop the Territory, but I think it is generally recognised that, for financial and other reasons, the Commonwealth has far better opportunities than South Australia ever had of doing justice to this very large province. Many charges have been levelled at the South Australian Government in regard to its inability Ito deal with this so-called white elephant. It must not be forgotten, however, that a large portion of the Northern Territory consists of tropical country, and that, in the opinion of many people, tropical production can be carried; on only by a subject race!, or persons in a state of slavery or semi-slavery. The very fact that South Australia declined to develop the tropical portion of the continent under such conditions, is a reason, which need not be enlarged upon, for the absence of a large white population there. The honorable member for Calare said that the Northern Territory laboured under a very heavy debt. As a matter of fact, until the South Australian Government undertook the construction of the railway there, and some harbor improvements at Palmerston, it was free from debt; and. as against the liability we have taken over, we have the harbor works and railways of the Territory to show. The remaining debt was incurred in connexion with the first steps taken some forty or fifty years ago to encourage settlement.  Instead of pursuing a reckless policy, the State has always been cautions not to pile up a heavy financial burden, recognising that, sooner or later, . the Territory would be controlled by a National Parliament. It has been suggested that the absence of Ministers in London has had something to do with the failure to promulgate a more forward policy. Imperial Conferences and Coronation celebrations do not occur every year; and, to my mind', it is by no means undesirable that our leading public men should visit London at short periods, in order to take part in the Imperial Conference. I regret very much the speech made on this question by the honorable member for Gwydir. He is a man of undoubted ability, intelligence, and industry ; but if the outside public gauge the value of his utterances on other questions by that of the speech which he delivered to-day, his reputation must suffer. The honorable member referred1 to the absence of gold-mining in the Territory. As a matter of fact, there has been a great deal of mining for gold, and the industry is still being carried on profitably at the present time. The backward state of mineral development is due to the fact that the fields have never been properly tested, and never can be until they are opened up by means of railways. We all know that gold can be won, but the question is whether it can be won at a price that will pay. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> L. Solomon, who was a member of the House of Representatives, and resided in the Territory for upwards of twenty years, often discussed this question with me, and told me again and again that the non-development of the mining resources of the Territory was due to the absence of capital. Water is generally <inline font-style="italic">struck at</inline> a depth of  joo  feet, and the mining company that encounters the water difficulty must erect machinery to cope with it. The man who declares that there is no gold in the Territory merely shows that he is incapable of dealing with the matter in a fair and reasonable manner. </para>

As a rule, Europeans do not care to engage for work in the interior unless they have a reasonable prospect of a lengthy period of employment, and their return passages are guaranteed. The Northern Territory has always been a happy hunting ground for mining schemers. I do not think many Australian investors have lost money up there ; but numerous schemes have been put on the London market in connexion with which a large amount of capital has been subscribed and lost. As  a  matter of fact, we have a lot of valuable mining machinery lying idle in the Northern Territory to-day. </para>

                            <para>- It was brought out, but never placed in position. An idea got abroad that the prospects were not as good as had been represented ; but from our point of view, as intelligent Australians, mining in the Northern Territory has never had a fair show. Drapers, tinkers, and tailors are excellent men, but they are not mining experts ; and when such men pose  as  great mining experts, as I have seen them do in the West, we know what to expect. When mining development depends upon the reports of such persons, we must expect failures. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solomon</inline> told me repeatedly that the failure of mining development in the Territory was due to the fact that no company had ever had the pluck to cope with the water difficulty there. I have it on the authority of men who have spent years in the Territory that it is an exceedingly valuable country. It is true that the Government might have done more than they have done ; but a mere discussion of what might have been done w.ill not help us out of the difficulty. Our real trouble is that we do not know enough about the Territory. I should like to see a lot of money spent within the next ten years, so that we should be able, at the end of that period, to cry a halt, because we had ample information in regard to it. The Government ought to appoint a commission of inquiry. There should be on that commission a first-class engineer, having a knowledge of railway and harbor works, and a first-class surveyor, possessing also an intimate knowledge of pastoral and agricultural country. There are such men in the Crown Lands Office in Adelaide, and no doubt surveyors with a like knowledge are to be found in the Lands Departments of other States. There should also be on the commission  a  mining expert. These men should be allowed to travel the country- to make  a  thorough investigation - and upon the presentation of their report we should be in  a  much better position to deal with the Territory than we are to-day. A sum of £10,000 would go a long way towards paying the expenses of such a commission. Only first-class men - men with a reputation to lose - should be appointed to carry out this work of inquiry for us, and I am sure that they would supply us with information of a thoroughly reliable character. Whilst I should be the last to say anything about a commission consisting of honorable members of this House, I think that, in this case, we require a commission of experts. At present we have one set of men always condemning the Territory, and another set always praising it. I do not believe in going to either extreme ; but I think that we certainly have in the Territory a vast tract of country of very great value. If my suggestion were adopted, we should feel surer of our ground than we do at present. One reason why the Pine Creek and Oodnadatta railway lines should be linked up as quickly as possible is that such a work would not only develop the Territory, but enable us to obtain a quick return for our money. The wealth of Australia to-day is derived largely from cattle, sheep, and wheat. The production of cotton and other tropical crops is all very well in its way, but I should like a large sum to be spent in the development of the Territory along lines that would insure a reasonable prospect of an early return. It is my contention that wheat can be grown profitably in the Northern Territory. </para>

They exist not at Palmerston, but further south, and the best are in the Victoria River country. There we have a lot of good land. The climate of the Territory is an assured one. A settler there knows, that, at any rate, by the end of November, the rainy season begins, and has to be put up with until the end of February. Certainty of climatic conditions means a great deal, because it is an unsettled climate that constitutes the greatest danger to those who are dealing in primary products. In Canada, a wheat crop can be raised and harvested in a hundred days. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> was strongly of opinion that the same thing could be done in the Northern Territory by sowing the wheat immediately after the wet season. </para>

                            <para>- A strong <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case can be made out for the growing of wheat there. One member of the commission would undoubtedly have to be acquainted with the country, and would be able to point out the parts where the work could be undertaken. If we can get a tremendous amount of wheat grown in the Territory, it will pay those engaged in the undertaking, and recoup us from a National point of view ; but we must have railway communication to shift the produce away. It is of no use to think of doing anything in that direction until the country is opened up by railways. No honorable member can dogmatize on the question of where the different railways ought to be run. That is not a political, but an engineering, question. We must be prepared to be guided by experts in all these matters, and the success we make of the Territory will be proportionate to our readiness to sink our own political views, and allow these men to guide us. A good deal1 can be done along the lines which I have indicated to the Minister, and I hope he will do everything possible to demonstrate what the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> had no doubt of in regard to wheat production. The honorable member for Calare referred to the long leases granted in the Territory. I regret that they were granted, but honorable members can easily understand how it came about, with two members for the Territory urging the granting of long leases at low rentals, and the South Australian Parliament anxious to do everything possible to meet their views. If the Minister looks into the leases, however, he will find that they contain certain important conditions. If the country is allowed to be monopolized, it will not reflect very much credit on the Minister or those who have control' of the Territory, because when leases of that character are granted over great tracts of country, they generally contain conditions requiring the holders to give the country up or fulfil certain undertakings. </para>

                            <para>- I have already honestly admitted that the South Australian. Government bit off more than they could chew, but the Commonwealth Parliament has not done anything of the sort. I admit that the task is a big one; but, as the honorable member for Macquarie said, it is- a task which we have undertaken for good or for evil, and which we must carry through. We have possession of the Territory, and are bound to carry the responsibility. The next thing for us to- do is to make, not the best of a bad bargain, but the best of a good bargain. It will call for pluck, keenness, sound judgment, and the best information we can get to guide us. Those, however, are not qualities which greatly frighten Australians. We have had far more difficult jobs to tackle, and we can tackle this and pull it through. We must have sound information to guide us, in the first place, and we must have it in abundance. There is a great deal of work to be done before the Federal Parliament can say that it has had so much information about the Territory that it is sick of it. </para>

                    <para>On the question of the control of the Pacific, we are not in a position to know what transpired at the Conference in London between the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Foreign Secretary, the Colonial Secretary, and Ministers of the oversea Dominions. If we wanted to know it, we should not be told, because, in accordance with the traditional policy of the Foreign Office, the communications were confidential. At the same time, by watching current events we can, I think, guess the trend of .the policy of the British Government on the Pacific question. It would be well if we could induce the people of Australia to look at the question from a diplomatic point of view rather than in the way in which it is regarded here at the present time. What happens now is that the average Australian is scared lest the Japanese should arrive in the Northern Territory, while another type of Australian laughs at the fear. The extension of the British treaty with Japan for another ten years is most significant, and cannot be regarded as unfavorable to Australian interests. It is difficult to know the merits or demerits of the Tariff agreement which the late Canadian Government endeavoured to arrive at with the United States of America; but  President  Taft has on more than one occasion voiced the desirability of the United States, Canada, and Australia controlling the Pacific. There is a great deal in that idea, which has occupied the attention of many public men outside Australia for a long while. It behoves us, as a Commonwealth, to do our utmost to bring about such an arrangement. It is equally obvious that British diplomacy is guided in all its actions by a desire to preserve the cordial understanding now existing between the British Government and the Government at Paris. There is no doubt that it will be many a long day before French and British troops, and French and British navies, face each other again as enemies. The whole trend of European affairs points to a cordial alliance between France and the Mother Country, and, that being the case, it is very desirable that in all the calculations which we make with regard to the islands of the Pacific we should recognise the fact that the Mother Country will always be prepared to treat very generously any claim put in by her neighbours, the French Republic. No intelligent Australian thinks it possible for us to carry out a foreign policy which is not in conformity with the policy of the Mother Country. We have, indeed, every reason to fall in with the views of the Mother Country in those matters, because I cannot recall any time when she has not been actuated by a desire to treat with justice any intelligent claim which has been put in by the people of Australia. We should do everything possible to bring about a recognition of the fundamental principle that the future .control of the Pacific must be in the hands of America, Canada, and Australia ; but we must always bear in mind that it is a matter for diplomacy. It cannot be expected that Australia and Australian interests and America and American interests should monopolize the whole Pacific, and so bar Japanese expansion. The right of Japan to a certain scope- for fair expansion will have to be recognised, care being taken that Australian interests are not detrimentally affected. The time has arrived for this Parliament to have something like a policy on these important world questions. We ought, through the proper authorities, to endeavour to ascertain the views of America on the Pacific question, and we can easily learn the views of France, so that there may be a cordial understanding between us all, and we may be fully prepared in case of eventualities with Japan. I never did have any fear of the expansion of Japan to the detriment of Australia, or the injury of Australian interests, but one of the worst dangers in- international politics is drift; and we ought not to drift on an important question of this kind. We ought to have a policy on which we can rely to guard our interests in every complication that may arise in London or in Paris. </para>

                        <para>. - I am pleased to hear the note pf hopefulness in the speech of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. The biggest disappointment to me in regard to the Estimates is the small mining vote. There is one item of £1,000 " to provide working in connexion with the establishment of Trust Fund - minerals account," and  ^£9,000  for prospecting for metals and minerals, and in aid of deep sinking, and purchasing machinery. Mining development is undoubtedly at the base of our success in the Northern Territory. We know what mining did for New South Wales and Victoria in the early days, and what it has done later for Western Australia. In a territory like this, unprospected and untried, there are greater potentialities than those discovered in any of the States. I am not speaking particularly of gold, for that is not so lavishly spread in the Northern Territory as elsewhere; but that is not to say that the wealth of the Territory may not be far greater than that of any of the States. We have ample evidence that there are payable minerals there, including gold and tin ; and wherever there is tin we have the associated wolfram, bismuth, and so forth. The gamut of minerals runs over about 600 varieties ; and doubtless there are many in Australia of which we as yet know nothing. There is, for instance, radium, which will doubtless create Eldorados in this country. For men to calmly tell us that the Northern Territory is practically exhausted minerally is to show an ignorance absolutely pitiful ; and those who make a weapon of the fact that there is idle machinery lying about, know little of mining in, say, New South Wales. I know field after field where there are hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of machinery lying idle on mine after mine, because the whole of the development has been done on the surface, and the work then abandoned. It is the commonest knowledge in connexion with mining speculation, though not in connexion with mining development, that there is a tendency to float mines on big prospectuses, and to spend all the available cash on a big display of machinery without going into any detailed work. This has happened even in accessible places within recent years, and to condemn the Territory on that ground is sheer folly. One striking and undesirable feature in mining work in the Northern Territory is the presence of the " Chow." While the Chinaman can fossick for alluvial gold, at which he is a first-rate hand, the moment he is asked to go into the bowels of the earth he is a positive failure. When Korea was taken by the Japanese it was discovered that the mines would have to contain millions of pounds' worth of mineral to pay, owing to the ideas of work being so crude. I am told by one who has had experience in the Territory that directly a mine gets to about, say, 100 feet, the work has to be abandoned, owing to the incompetence of the Chinese workers. Of course, if the mines in the Northern Territory had been ordinarily rich, no doubt smart miners from Queensland and New South Wales would have developed them, and many would have proved payable ; but they have been worked only on the surface, and any honorable member with practical experience knows that in a tropical country, if much of the surface is opened, the first tropical downpour brings in all the top, - unless it is particularly well safeguarded. One expert, whose word I do not doubt, told me that he saw several mines, which, after the richest ores had been taken from the top by the Chinese, had been left to collapse. I have earned my living at mining, and know something of the subject; and I declare that the Northern Territory, from a mining point of view, has been no more than hen-scratched in the most primitive manner. I urge on the Government, in approaching the question of mining development, to decide on a code of mining laws as soon as possible. I understand that up to the present we are operating under the South Australian law? </para>

                            <para>- I am not acquainted with that law. I claim, however, to have a thorough knowledge of the mining law of New South Wales, and some knowledge of the Western Australian law; and my experience is that, up to the present, it has all been in favour of the big speculator, and against the prospector with the pick and shovel. If we desire to have new fields developed, we must encourage the intrepid working prospector. Any mining law adopted should be closely scrutinized, so that, as a beginning, absolutely fair play may be given to the worker. If I were going out mining into the Northern Territory, I should certainly wish to know under what conditions I had to operate, and what security the law gave me over any discoveries I might make. The Chinese have been allowed to mop up the easiest and most accessible minerals; and it is an absolute disgrace to the South Australian Government that this should be so, after the experience on the mining fields of Victoria and New South Wales. We had better have no mining development at all than permit this exploitation by Chinese, whose one end and aim is to make all the gold they can, and then leave with it for their native country. The presence of the Chinese has been one of the greatest curses to mining in Australia. Even on the New England fields, they have not only gained possession of the most accessible minerals, but they have established themselves as storekeepers, mineral buyers, and exploiters in general.  1  guarantee that if an investigation were made now, it would be found that the Chinese are the chief mineral buyers and exporters in the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to be unfair to those who came before the Labour party, but I had to give a true reply to the interjection of the honorable member for Moreton. The Northern Territory is in greater danger from this cause than any of the States, owing to its proximity to China and Japan. Of course, we cannot ask the Government to do more than their finances will allow ; but if the Territory is to be developed with anything like certainty, the legitimate miner will have to be supplied with batteries and crushing plant, and, above all, with concentrating machinery. It can be easily imagined that any mining discovery might yield refractory ore, which would cost a great deal to treat ; and, with the difficulties of transit, it would be almost impossible to export it in large bulk. A good concentrating plant, or several such plants, controlled by expert Government officials, should be established wherever needed, for the production of rich concentrates for export, until such time as smelting and purification can be done on the spot. I do not expect the Government to succeed in everything at once, but I desire that everything possible shall be done for the assistance of the miners. The next step is to see that they obtain fair prices for their products, and that the middleman is abolished. Those who have been engaged in mining for wolfram, tin, bismuth, and copper, know that it is a very different thing from mining for gold, because it is much more difficult to sell the result. In disposing of such minerals, one is in the clutch of the middleman. The Labour Government, being in sympathy with the real miner, the pick and shovel man, should become his agent. I do not ask that the miner be paid at once the full value of the mineral he produces, but he should be given an advance of at least 50 per cent, of its market value, and when the mineral has been exported to France, Germany, the United States, or England, and returns received, they should be paid to him, less  a  percentage to cover charges. Men cannot be expected to risk their- lives in tropical climates merely to fatten up middlemen. For many years, the Labour party has had in its platform a plank asking for the nationalization of all means for the maintenance of health. We advocate Government control of hospitals, and the appointment of Government doctors. This policy should be put into effect in the Territory. If the Government can guarantee intending immigrants that their health shall be looked after, it will do much to induce immigration. Miners are generally able to look after themselves well, and take a few simple medicines with them, but there are times when they become ill, and their mates can do nothing for them. What is needed is the appointment of doctors and nurses who will visit the various fields and outposts from time to time. No private doctor could do this, because such a practice would not be profitable, but the Government could provide for it, and my experience makes me say that such provision would be a great boon to the miners, and, of course, they would share it with all other settlers. The men connected with mining are now sometimes cheated in connexion with assays, and often find it difficult to get a definite and reliable assay in regard to a mineral that is not well known. New South Wales has a State Assaying Department, but scores of miners would sooner pay a guinea for an assay by a private individual, not because the Department is incapable, but because it is dilettante. There should be a State Department big enough to handle at once all the samples submitted to it, because miners should not be kept waiting a month or two for the result of an assay. A mining centre is always a nucleus of settlement. Miners need foodstuffs, and thus give a market for the produce of the farmer and the pastoralist. In the construction of railways, it will be necessary to link together these mining centres, and to give connexion with agricultural land. In this way, the country should be settled very effectively. It will then be necessary to find foreign markets for its produce. The Government should see that the producers are paid full value for their produce. In South Australia, there is a State Produce Department, which has done magnificent work, but the Commonwealth Department could do still better work in the Northern Territory, because it would be able to control production better. I am glad; that freezing works are to be established, and I hope _ that tinning and drying works will follow, so that foodstuffs may be prepared for distribution and export. The Government will do well to attend to the acclimatization of animals which it may be advantageous from a commercial point of view to introduce. I have it on the best authority that there are many thousands of buffaloes in the Territory, which are 'being ruthlessly destroyed for the sake of their hides. These buffaloes are probably immune to tick and red-water, and it might be worth while to ascertain whether, by judicious crossing, a breed of cattle could be obtained which wOuld suit the Northern Territory. The Bureau of Statistics and Information should be of tremendous value. I hope that the Government will not spare expense in these directions. To do so would be to delay development. In some directions, money at first must be spent sparingly, but in others all expenditure in reason will be justified. The Bureau of Statistics and Information will instruct the people of the Territory as to the best means to prove its capabilities. In connexion with the making of advances to miners on minerals, it will be necessary to establish a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in the Territory, and I am surprised that provision is not made for that on the Estimates. At first, its business will not be large, but a beginning should be made. The question has been raised, " Can white men develop the Territory?" - a most serious problem. Some say that white men cannot develop it, and others that they can. My mind is open to conviction on the point. I am willing that there should be a test made, extending over seven or ten years, because, at the present time, I would not say that the white man will be a success, nor should I be prepared to sanction the importation of coloured labour. As an illustration of what can be done to enable the white man to live in tropical country, I would recall, the fact that when the French commenced to cut the Panama Canal, their men died by the thousand, like rotten sheep, succumbing to malaria, and even to the bites of a poisonous spider which is almost as large as a pigeon's egg. All their efforts were a failure. Then the United States stepped in, and did what I am asking the Government to do in connexion with the Northern Territory, that is, they sent out Government doctors to make an examination of the disease-breeding centres. The mosquito was given his quietus, and malaria gradually disappeared. The canal is in a zone more dangerous to human life than the Northern Territory. The Government also decided that the men employed on the construction of the canal should have the best food obtainable, and that full attention should be paid to sanitary requirements. We should adopt the same system in the development of the Northern Territory. The work done in connexion with the Panama Canal in this regard should be an object-lesson to the Commonwealth Government. What was done there is possible in the Northern Territory, and I hope that the Government will grapple with this problem in a way which will show that they mean business. Let them safeguard the health of the people, and give every facility to the miner and to the settler of every description to carry on his industry, and to secure the best possible market for his produce. If this is done, there must be great possibilities of development. If, however, we adopt the fatal policy of drift - and the Estimates would .seem to suggest that there is a tendency in that direction - the Territory must prove a white elephant. I know that honorable members are anxious to close this debate, but, as one who has taken a keen interest in the Territory, I shall, perhaps, be pardoned for dealing briefly with the question. </para>

                            <para>- I did not take part in the Budget debate, but some who did have also taken part in the discussion on these Estimates. I do .not want to speak at length, but when I see such a programme as that put before us by the Government, so far as the Northern Territory is concerned, I am afraid that we are drifting. If we do not give the Government more money, and if they do not attack this proposition more vigorously than they have done, I shall have fears both for the Ministry and the Territory. I desire to heartily congratulate the Government on their adoption, of the leasehold policy. The problem which confronts us with regard to land settlement relates to the granting of large areas at the outset, and to gradually reducing the areas as settlement goes on. To attempt anything but .the leasehold system would be to make the Territory a gambling ground for speculators, who would block settlement by charging high prices for their land as the population increased., A freehold system of land tenure in respect of large areas would, so to speak, crucify the Territory. I hope that the Government will soon bring their leasehold policy to the front, so that intending settlers may know what they have to expect. I have been frequently questioned by men who wish to go to the Territory regarding the terms on which land may be secured there, and I can only say to them that the Government are not yet ready to proceed, but that under a Labour Administration they will be treated well. That, however, is not in itself sufficient for the man who wants to sell up his home and settle in the Territory. It is, therefore, high time that the Minister propounded his leasing policy. In conclusion, I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the main points I have raised, and which relate to the establishment of a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in the Territory, the creation of a Mines Department that will properly control and develop mining interests, a proper Produce Department, and a Medical Department, with all the accessories necessary for the laying down of a sound foundation for the development of the Territory. I am prepared to give my hearty support to any reasonable proposition which the Government may bring down to thoroughly develop the Northern Territory. I recognise, as honorable members do generally, that the problem is a very difficult one, and I am prepared to support the Government in going slowly in respect of what I may describe as foundation departments, which need the most careful examination to secure success. It is all very well for honorable members to say, " Let us spend a million or more in constructing a railway," but we should profit by the experience of the States, and, first of all, make careful inquiry as to the best route for a developmental line to follow. </para>

                        <para>.- We have in these Estimates an item of £410 in respect to the Coronation celebrations, and we find that the expenditure under last year's Estimates in this respect was £2,342. I presume that this item refers to the payment of £130 each to honorable members who formed the delegation to London to take part in the Coronation celebrations, and I desire to refer to the absolutely poor and miserable display made by the Commonwealth in connexion with those celebrations. Troops from every other part of the Empire took part in the procession, but the Commonwealth was not represented, nor was there a Commonwealth arch along the line of route. Standing with another honorable member beside the New Zealand arch, I heard references made by the crowd to the absence of any arch to indicate that there was such a place as Australia, and we heard the remark freely made that the Commonwealth was too poor to be able to pay for one. Seeing that the Commonwealth thought fit to send a delegation of members of this Parliament to London to take part in this Empire festival, I think that we should have been careful to make an adequate display in connexion with an event of such world wide importance. The Government even refused to give official recognition to the cadets who were sent Home at the expense of private citizens of New South Wales. The Minister of Defence was careful to be present at the reception of the cadets at Charing Cross station, but, in the circumstances he might as well have stopped away. He and his fellow members of the Government did their utmost to prevent the proper representation of the Commonwealth at this important celebration. I do not wish to elaborate the matter. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of that; but I desire to emphasize the point that our representation in connexion with the Coronation celebrations was paltry, and an absolute disgrace to the Government. Australians in London who saw the Prime Minister seated in a carriage with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, and escorted by Canadian troops, felt heartily ashamed of the failure of the Government to send a contingent of Australian troops to London to take part in the procession. The Ministry ought to be heartily ashamed of their action, and I sincerely trust thai in connexion with any future Empire celebrations Australia will be properly represented. </para>

                        <para>,- It is unfortunate that the Government ha.ve been unable to make better provision in these Estimates for the development of Papua. It is understood that a loan for developmental purposes was asked for by the Papuan administration; if so, the request deserves sympathetic consideration. Every honorable member who took part in the recent visit to the Territory was greatly impressed with the efforts of the local Government to promote settlement, and to render it less burdensome than it has been to the Commonwealth. The revenue of Papua is very small, and is not likely to be materially increased during the next few years ; but if the Commonwealth granted the Papuan Executive a loan of, say, £250,000, a good deal could be done during the next ten or fifteen years to develop the country. Much has been done certainly; yet only a tithe of what urgently requires doing can be attempted with the revenue at the disposal of the local authorities. I do not believe there is a single harbor outside Port Moresby and Samarai where a ship can anchor. Every ship coming into other ports has to anchor miles away - from the land, and all the goods required by the residents have to be lightered to the shore at heavy cost and great inconvenience. To give an instance of the difficulties encountered in landing goods, we had on board, on the trip from Samarai to Woodlark Island, a considerable quantity of rails for a tram line for one of the local mines. The ship could not remain sufficiently long to land them all, the lighterage was insufficient, and although the men worked night and day, a great quantity of the rails had to be brought back and unshipped at Samarai. Then the coast is absolutely barren of any guides to navigation, which is, in consequence, extremely perilous in these waters. As a rule, ships are obliged to anchor during the night, especially between Samarai and Woodlark Island. Although provision is made on the Estimates for wireless telegraphy, stations will be wanted at other ports than Port Moresby,. We ought really to have had a cable between Australia and some part of New Guinea long before this. In this and other respects, Australia certainly ought to see that more justice is done to this great Dependency of ours. The local Government are doing everything they possibly can, with the limited funds at their disposal, but it is obvious that for some years they will be unable to command sufficient money to erect lighthouses or furnish other essentials to safe navigation. All these things will require considerable outlay, and it is vain to expect that the local Government can do the work out of their own slender resources. Every difficulty in the transhipment of goods, and all these delays to navigation, increase the cost of living in the Territory. If we wish the island to be settled, and its resources to be developed, we must make it more attractive than it is at present for people to go there. Up to the present no communication is possible with Papua except by steamer about once every three weeks. We spent nearly three weeks in and around Port Moresby, Samarai, and Woodlark Island, and during the whole of that time not a soul on board was able to get a message to or from Australia. Such isolation, within a Tew hours' steaming of our northern coast, is not calculated to render Papua attractive to settlers. While I welcome the provision made for a wireless station, the Committee would be only playing with the question if they believed that this would be sufficient for the needs of the Papuan population. All the members of the parliamentary party will admit that the provision made in the Estimates this year is altogether inadequate. </para>

                    <para class="block">Thursday Island to the nearest part of the New Guinea coast is not great, and might well be bridged by a cable. I should like the Minister to give us some idea of the intentions of the Government in regard to the request for a loan for the development of the Territory. The proposal is for a loan, not a gift. I believe that, if a loan were granted to the Territory - and we have the necessary funds - the revenue accruing from the expenditure will be sufficient to pay the interest and sinking fund so as to cover the whole loan within a period of, say, twenty-five years. The money could be used  to great advantage. A portion of it could be used to replace the <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England,</inline> which, although a good sea-going craft, is quite unsuitable for her work. Despite this, the upkeep of the steamer entails very heavy outlay. The fact is that the <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England</inline> was not- built, for the purposes for which she is being used, and so the refitting at intervals involves considerable expense which otherwise might have been avoided. I would strongly urge the Minister to get rid of the <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England,</inline> and purchase a steamer suitable for the peculiar service that is required. In fact, two steamers are necessary. The supervision of the island must be carried out from the various ports, and not by excursions from point to point on land. The rugged character of the interior accounts for this, and explains the necessity of facilities for travelling by .ocean and river. I am certain that if the Minister could supply the Committee with figures showing the cost of the upkeep of the <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England</inline> during the last seven or eight years, honorable members would be startled. I see no amount on these Estimates for the purpose, but if my memory serves me right, the cost of refitting and repairing that vessel last time was about ,£4,000, and I heard when we were in Brisbane that the next time she went there for repairs she would not get out under £5,000 or £6,000. </para>

                        <para>. - I am extremely glad that during the recess a number of honorable members visited Papua, but I rather regret that nearly all who went there were from one side of the House only. I should have been pleased if a number of those sitting in Opposition had also been able to make the trip, because the more members of Parliament visit the different parts of Australia, and the Territories under its control, the better. The members who went to Papua were good enough to meet my late lamented predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> for ' some three or four hours two or three days before he died, and they placed before him <inline font-style="italic">in externa</inline> their views on the question of the Territory. These were taken down in shorthand, and I am glad to say that the Department has the full advantage of the experience which honorable members gained whilst there. I was pleased to learn from the members that they were very well satisfied with what they saw in Papua. They recognised that a good deal had been done, and that a good deal more had to be done. As to wireless telegraphy, I am extremely anxious that there should be a station erected at Port Moresby. Were I not an ex-Postmaster-General, I might, perhaps, be a little more impatient, but I know the difficulties which surround the question. I think, however, that the Government are beginning to see the end of our difficulties, and the Postmaster-General has promised that one of the first stations shall be at Port Moresby. Whether the next one shall be at Thursday Island or Cooktown is a matter which, as Minister of External Affairs, I am prepared to leave to the expert. Stations are requested for Hobart, Brisbane, Cape Borda, and other places ; and if these can be provided shortly it will be a good thing for the Commonwealth. In regard to Papua, the New <inline font-style="italic">South</inline> Wales Government have lent to the Commonwealth one of their leading mining experts in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Came,</inline> who has already left for the Possession, in order to visit the coal-field, and also to investigate the alleged discovery of petroleum oil. Of course, whether this oil has been discovered or not we cannot say, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Came</inline> will make inquiries as to the facts. As the' honorable member for Coolgardie has said, the Legislative Assembly of Papua has recommended to the Government a loan of about ,£250,000, and the recommendation has been sent back with a request for further details, without which we do not feel justified in raising this sum. Honorable members will realize that, with a Scotch Treasurer, particulars are demanded before any advance of the kind is made. There are one or two matters, however, which must be attended to, one of which is the replacement of the <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England.</inline></para>

More support is required for the able Lieutenant-Governor and the capable officers under him, who spend a good deal of their lives, time, and labour in work that does not yield sufficient fruits nor confer sufficient reward. The absence of means of supply and communication is the principal obstacle. </para>

                        <para>.- When, some time ago, I gave way to allow the Minister to speak, I was about to dwell on the necessity of providing some superannuation or retiring allowance for officers -who have served in, Papua. The climate is extremely trying, and, in parts, very unhealthy ; and it is an ascertained fact that a white man cannot live there long without a prolonged change to more salubrious surroundings. It may be said that the officers ought to provide their own retiring allowance, as in the Commonwealth service generally ; but their salaries are so small that it is impossible for them to do so, as honorable members who have seen the annual report of the Administrator, will admit. The remuneration would be regarded as low, even in Australia; and when we consider the remote and isolated part of the world in which these men work, the unhealthy climate, and the excessive cost of living, it is seen that there is no margin for provision for a " rainy day." The Minister ought either to revise the salaries on a more liberal scale, or provide that the officers shall be eligible for some kind </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Df  retiring allowance on reaching a certain age. All the white residents are at some time or other attacked by fever, which is a most enervating complaint, rendering it absolutely necessary for them to have a change ; and a visit to the south or elsewhere involves considerable expense. The Department, I admit, has been very generous in the matter of leave ; but, unfortunately, an officer, when he resumes duty, is almost penniless, the holiday having cost nearly all his savings. However, the main point is that if the Government desires the best service for Papua, they must pay more for it. The life may have attractions for some men of adventurous disposition, who find in its wild freedom compensation for the poor prizes offered by Government. But, speaking generally, the service will not draw the most capable men under existing conditions. With the exception of the chief executive officers and one or two resident magistrates and surveyors, the highest salary paid is £450, a sum for which we could hardly expect to get the services of a competent surveyor or magistrate in the civilized portions of Australia. Then we find that an important officer like the Assistant Government Printer receives only £200 per annum, 'the wages of an ordinary' compositor in Melbourne or Sydney. Indeed, some of the men employed on the typesetting machines for the morning newspapers make a great deal more. The Collector of Customs receives1 £520 per annum, and his accountant only £300, while the clerks in the Lands Department are paid £200. Food imports are largely controlled by one shipping company, and the cost of living is so high that a man with £-200 a year is practically unable to save anything. Another matter, which has probably been brought under the notice of the Minister, is the proposal that the Legislative Council shall consist of members elected by the white population. That will seem very plausible in the absence of a knowledge of local conditions. But, owing to the peculiar circumstances of Papua, it would, in my opinion, be very dangerous to allow the handful of white people to dominate the situation. It must be remembered that there are in the Territory under 900 white people, while the aboriginal inhabitants number, probably, some hundreds of thousands. Their exact strength is still unknown. Now, the taxation is not, as one might at first imagine, borne entirely by the white people. On the contrary, the bulk of it is paid by the aborigines. These natives work for the planters, and, by their consumption of dutiable goods, contribute a very large share of the revenue. At this stage of the development of the Possession, I am not prepared to hand over the control of hundreds of thousands of natives to  900  white people, a great many of whom are interested in their exploitation. The white residents may be a very admirable and estimable people; but where a man's interests are served by degrading the natives to a condition of semi-servitude, he requires to be something more than human if he does not at times yield to temptation. The native race require our protecting arm, for they are a most docile and interesting people. Of course, they are addicted to the horrible habit of cannibalism, but that is an ingrained custom' in which they see no harm or hardship. So far as my information goes, very few white men, in  recent  years have been killed and eaten by the natives. On the contrary, they respond well to those who treat them kindly. If they have what to us are inexplicable customs, they are very amenable to discipline ; and it would be a national reproach if our occupation of the Territory resulted in their destruction or deterioration. The Government should extend its beneficent influence still further into the interior. I pay my tribute of admiration to the work which has been done, and is being done, for the natives by the missionaries as well as by the Government, 'and both deserve great commendation. In this connexion, I am glad to say that in my judgment the rumours at one time current about the excessive loss of native life in the recent Kikori expedition were greatly exaggerated. In all, eleven native carriers died during the. progress of the expedition. The subsequent judicial inquiry at Port Moresby brought out the facts ; and it is -regrettable that they were not published with the sensational news which first filtered out concerning the expedition. I admit that the loss of so many lives was very deplorable. It is the more so because the natives were forced to take part in this expedition. A native may refuse to engage with a private individual, but he has no choice when called on in the name of' the Government of the Territory. That is a command which he dare not disobey, under pain of physical punishment. This renders the occurrence doubly regrettable; for the deaths of these men, away from their own tribes, will render the future work of the Government, the missionaries, and prospectors somewhat hazardous in the region from which these natives were drawn. The history of the whole affair is now fully given in the files which have been recently made available. Incidentally, they show that the then Administrator, who set out to inspect a recently-discovered coal-field, had changed his plans and gone in a contrary direction. In the memorandum addressed to him by the Acting Minister it is stated that his absence from head-quarters had necessitated the holding up of important matters of administration, and that a sum of some £5,000 was expended in connexion with the expedition and the search parties. The memorandum proceeds to point out that it was a mistake that - </para>
                    <para>Only  a  very small supply of rice was taken by the expedition as food for the natives, and it is difficult to avoid thinking that, had a good supply of staple food of the natives been carried, they would have been in better physical condition to withstand the hardships and privations to which they were subjected. Cornflour - and  a  limited supply even of that - when the magnitude of the expedition is taken into consideration - can scarcely be regarded as a reasonable substitute for rice. </para>
                    <para class="block">This was written in reply to the then Administrator's report of the expedition and of the food supply which he took with him. The next paragraphs bear upon the fact that the natives are forced to carry for Government officers - </para>

                        <para>It must not be overlooked that these natives were taken by the representative of the Government of the Territory and pressed into service as carriers, yet, although they could not refuse to go as carriers when told to do so, they were given beatings for stealing when the pangs of hunger were strong upon them, or for not marching as fast as desired. The Papuan authorities have achieved a reputation for humane treatment of the natives, and it comes as a shock 'to learn that any of them have been treated in the manner described in the evidence. The care of the natives is a trust imposed on and accepted by the Government of the Territory, and the occurrence of anything which savours of a departure from the broad humanitarian lines which the Administration has so long followed must be regarded with much concern. It is sincerely hoped that no instances of this kind will occur in future. </para>

Mackay and Little; but it appears that the party went in a different direction and got lost. The expedition may, however, have had valuable results ; its leader certainly deserves great credit for his courage and for the hardships which he endured. In conclusion, I would urge that additional funds be placed at the disposal of the Government of Papua to extend the influence of the magistrates. The services of native carriers are of great assistance to prospectors and others ; and the natives, because of the confidence which the Administration has inspired, are showing a willingness now to serve the white man. We have a great trust and responsibility in the possession of this Territory, and I am satisfied that if by justice and kindness we win the willing co-operation of the native race, it 'can be made an asset of inestimable value to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- There is, in these Estimates, one other item to which I desire to refer, and that is the proposed vote of £5,000 for the Antarctic Expedition under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mawson.</inline> Taken by itself, that' is a handsome grant; but when we know that New South Wales alone has set apart £7,500 for the same purpose, and that, owing to certain disappointments, the expedition has been launched with some £5,000 or £6,000 less than was anticipated to be necessary to meet its requirements, it appears to me that the Government might be reasonably asked to promptly reconsider the question. The Ministry should consider whether it ought not, at least, to bring our proposed grant up to that made by the Government of New South Wales by increasing it to £7,500. This is the first occasion on which a party of research will devote itself from first to last to an investigation of the circumstances and opportunities in the south polar regions and under which further observations in relation to climatic conditions, of first importance to Australia, will be made. The expedition will make a careful study of the whole of the conditions of this most interesting region, which has a direct and close relation to Australia! From there, probably, we may derive data that will enable forecasts to be made of weather conditions, and possibly of rainfall, that will be of the highest value to Australia, as well as, possibly, to other countries, such as South America, that are in the neighbourhood of the South Pole. The investigations proposed to be pursued have not only theoretical, but many practical, bearings, and though the expedition is purely scientific, every one of those included in it will again and again stake his 'life in the hope of serving his country. This should appeal to the country from which they proceed - most of the members of the expedition are Australians - and this continent must expect to reap the chief benefits from their inquiries. If time permitted one could enlarge upon many reasons why a claim can reasonably be put forward for the reconsideration of the amount of the grant. I hope the Cabinet will take an early opportunity of reviewing their attitude to this expedition. If Ministers have any doubt, Professor Masson, who, as the  Chairman  of the Committee associated with this enterprise, and who is deeply interested in the project, will be able to supply them with particulars. A great adventure of this character has many important possibilities, and is sure to produce valuable results, so that I think we might well ask the Government to exercise greater liberality in respect to it. If the expedition had set forth merely to achieve the great feat of reaching the South Pole, for which the whole world is desirous of competing, the position might have been different. But it makes no attempt to reach the Pole, setting forth with the sole object of thoroughly and systematically investigating all the circumstances and conditions of this enormous region which lies so close to Australia. </para>

I have since obtained some further information bearing on the. points raised. I have here a letter that appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 17 th October last, over the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> Temperley, managing director of the Independent Cable Association, in reply to some adverse criticisms that had appeared in that newspaper. It opens thus - </para>

                    <para>In Saturday's issue you publish a two-column article severely criticising the independent cable service of which I happen to be the managing director. </para>
                    <para class="block">Later on, he puts the position with which I dealt in this manner - </para>
                    <para>It is one of the factors which brought the independent association into existence that your association included a penalty clause in prohibition of publication of any cablegram you did not supply. Some of your papers have been fined by your association for inserting private cable messages. At the present time there are newspaper proprietaries taking your service which have expressed their desire to subscribe to the independent service, but are not allowed to do so under the terms of your exclusive contracts. I could name one proprietary which is supporting our service with a cash subsidy, and yet is prohibited, under contract with you, from publishing a single word of what we could supply. </para>
                    <para class="block">In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of 22nd October there also appeared an article headed " The Cables " ; " Combine <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Independent " ; " The Facts of the Case " ; " The Position of the <inline font-style="italic">Sun,"</inline> to which I desire to refer. Honorable members who do not come from New South Wales may know that the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> was preceded by an evening publication known as the <inline font-style="italic">Star.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Star,</inline> which was in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-Herald</inline> cable combination, desired also to publish messages received by the Independent Cable Association, but it was prevented from doing so by reason of the terms of its contract with the combine. Subsequently, it went into liquidation, and from its ashes rose the <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> This is what the proprietary write in this connexion - </para>
                    <para>As to the position of the <inline font-style="italic">Sun, it</inline> may be said first and foremost that this journal pays far more for the cable service it secures - </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the independent cable service - than it would have to pay had it cared to cast in its lot with the combine. Several months back the combine made strenuous efforts to secure the adherence of the <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> It offered terms so advantageous financially that the cost of cables to this journal for three years would have been immensely reduced. In fact, it could have secured the combine cables at less than one-half the sum it now pays for the independent service. The <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> turned down this offer. In doing <inline font-style="italic">so it</inline> was not animated <inline font-style="italic">by any</inline> high-minded ideas of philanthropy. This journal is a commercial concern, and the directors of the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> decided that the company would be likely to make far more money by producing a newspaper containing cable news obtained from sources different from those of the other three dailies in Sydney. That their decision was sound is shown by the progress of this journal during the last twelve months. </para>
                    <para class="block">Had the <inline font-style="italic">Star</inline> continued, it would have been liable, under the terms of its contract with the other company, to a fine of £1,000 for publishing a cable received from any outside source. I am credibly informed that the Independent Cable Association opened up communications with New Zealand, and that the combined press of the Dominion was most anxious to avail itself of its service. There again, however, a similar contract prohibited them from publishing cables received through that agency. The matter has engaged public attention in New Zealand, and in the New Zealand <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 12th October last there appeared a report of some utterances by the Prime Minister of the Dominion, from which I make the following quotation - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>As for the press work, while we had an excellent press in this country, they were to a very large extent attached, by arrangement, to the controllers of the press service of Australia, and the proprietors of the papers here had entered into an agreement for an extension of time. The great bulk of the press news which came out here comprised messages sent to the Australian press. One had nothing to say against the Australian press obtaining the best service they could get. Australia was a large country, and some of the metropolitan dailies nad big numbers of readers, but he was persuaded that it was a mistake for this country, though the press was well conducted and provided a good service, to be attached to a service that catered for Australian readers. It would be better to have an independent service working from England to New Zealand. The Pacific Cable Company ought to be availed of to enable this to be done. The Government of the day at this end would help as much as possible in a material way to have a thoroughly independent press cable service. (Hear, hear.) " I do hope," he added, " that there will be no possibility of the controllers of the press at this end entering further into the existing agreement when the time arrives. I am sure that whoever is responsible for the control of the cable between here and England the Government will require to do something, as has been done in Australia, to give an independent service to the press." He made this statement because of the little cable news, affecting us, appearing at home. Sometimes, even the occasional correspondence in the home papers from New Zealand writers was tinged with parochialism. Matters of broad interest affecting legislation and financial interests could be cabled. It could not be published very extensively under the pressure of the columns of the English papers; but in London one could remain for months and scarcely know that either Australia or New Zealand existed. The matter was becoming more important as time went on. There should be this closer contact between the portions of the Empire. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That practically bears out the position I put from the Australian stand-point in my earlier remarks. This is the second subsidy of the three that were promised, and it is time the Department looked ahead to decide its future policy regarding the All -Red route, and the subsidized service established in connexion with it. The subsidy will cease at the end of next year. The experiment has been amply justified, as the figures which I quoted earlier showed. As the. Pacific Cable is the nationally-owned line, on which we have helped to meet the deficiency for the last ten years, it will be wise to continue the present policy. I have learnt, on the authority of the manager, that for every £2,000 which the Press Cable Association receive in subsidies from- the Government they spend £2,200 in payment for cablegrams over the All-Red route. I should be glad if the Minister indicated the future policy of the Government in this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government are very well satisfied with the press cable subsidy. It is no financial loss to us, because, although we pay a subsidy of £2,000 a year, we receive a revenue of a little over £2,000 on account of the number of words that now comes over the Pacific Cable, for which we get landing charges. Previous to the subsidy being granted to the Independent Cable Association practically all the press words came over the Eastern Extension Company's line. In the year ended 30th September last, 463,726 press words came over the Pacific Cable, as against 21,635 words that came over it during the year prior to the granting of the subsidy. </para>

                            <para>- Most of the messages are for the Independent Cable Service. A few come over the Pacific Cable for the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> Syndicate, but most of their .messages still come over the Eastern Extension Company's line. Part of the contract with the Independent Cable Association is that their messages must come over the Pacific Cable, and, as I have indicated, the service practically costs us nothing. The cable is idle to-day for sixteen hours out of the twenty-four. It is a very good thing to have two cable services going, and consequently the Government are quite prepared to renew the contract with the Independent Cable Association. </para>

                        <para>.- I have left to the last one very important and serious item to which the circumstances of the time are giving greater and greater significance. The usual sum of £20,000 appears on the Estimates for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. I have not a word to say against the reasonable expenditure of that amount. I have certainly not regretted the appearance of the item- in previous Estimates, but the fact remains that, in one sense, the time for advertising has passed, or is passing. The present circumstances of the Mother Country show that thousands of people there are prepared to come here, having been won by these or other advertisements, or by their knowledge of Australia. They are ready to embark,, they are members of our own family, and of one blood with us ; but the means for their transit to Australia are not available. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the circumstances, instead of this item appearing  alone,  it requires to  be  supplemented by another grant in order that the Commonwealth may add to the excellent  efforts  being put forward by the States, so that we may actualally bring here the people for whom we have been advertising for years, and who are now willingly responding to our call. The arrangements entered into by the conjoint States to bring 30,000 persons from the Mother Country within the next year or so, are most satisfactory, and all concerned in it deserve applause and encouragement ; but surely the Commonwealth, the most interested party of all, is not to stand idle at this time, and leave the whole of the  Work  in the hands of the States, when our advertising investments have proved so fruitful that to-day a passage  to  Australia from Great Britain cannot be obtained for love or money. That is a most satisfactory state of affairs from one point of view, and a splendid advertisement for Australia all the world over. </para>

                            <para>- And for preceding Governments, who placed similar sums on the Estimates. I do not grudge the Minister his full share of the results of that policy which, by the way, was very sternly resisted when we first proposed it to the House. I hope he may be able to share in the harvest now being reaped from our joint efforts. We are now practically at a crisis. No vessels appear to be available. I understand that Victoria has chartered a vessel of its own to bring here a certain number of visitors from the United States, who are to be afforded opportunities of inspecting our irrigation developments, and of judging whether these are not mere  attractive  than anything that even the West of America has to offer. They must be more attractive, in the sense that they will be offered at a far lower price than has to be paid for irrigated land in  America.  Since I visited that portion of the United States, twenty years ago or more, the . irrigable land which was then purchasable for a few , dollars an acre is now up into the tens and scores of dollars, and yielding magnificent returns. We know that Australia possesses, although  in one  sense a limited area,  yet,  as  compared  with irrigation areas either in Europe or America, what may fairly be termed a very large area suitable for irrigation, awaiting population, and presenting splendid opportunities tor closer settlement from which many of the drawbacks of the ordinary life of the isolated agriculturist will be absent. Under the opportunities which we can offer, settlers will be gathered together so closely that their schools can be placed in their immediate vicinity, and familiar intercourse with their neighbours will add to life a solace that is often wanting in the backblocks. </para>

                            <para>- We need not try to do so. I propose to offer them additional population, which will add to their resources, increase their wealth, and enable them to occupy lands which have for a long time been lying idle. A golden opportunity is offered to this Government. Our advertising policy has succeeded. It was inaugurated by us so as to lead up to our policy of settlement, and for that settlement we now have every opportunity. We have great areas of land available in this State, and in other States great areas ready and waiting for occupation. We sorely need more people. This State is eager for population. Nothing more advantageous to Australia, nothing more calculated to promote business and increase the welfare of all classes of our citizens, can possibly be achieved, than by bringing here those thousands of energetic, honest, and capable citizens who are prepared to cast in their lot with us. They have at last learned that the circumstances to be found in this land are better than those they now enjoy, and are ready to help us to improve' our conditions and the opportunities for our own people. I hope the Minister will press this on the States, with a view to their taking their share of responsibility. If the States decline, then I am sure our people as a whole will stand behind the Government in acquiring all the possible settlers of the right sort whom we can obtain. They are now freely offering from the Mother Country. Their only difficulty is to cross the sea - a difficulty that we can bridge. We have the means and the opportunities ; and all we require are ships pouring this stream of life into the country. </para>

                        <para>.-I desire to make a brief personal explanation. When reading, earlier in the sitting, the despatch of the Minister of External Affairs to the Administrator of Papua, the honorable member for Kooyong invited me to produce the reply of the Administrator. The only document I have been able to secure is one written before the despatch, but I propose to read that, in justice to the Administrator. It is as follows: - </para>

                    <para>With regard to the light punishment some of the native carriers received by my orders, I desire to point out that the circumstances were altogether unusual. We were a small party travelling through unknown country, constantly being watched and coming into contact with natives who had never seen white people before. Unless I could prevent their gardens being pillaged and the natives robbed, the lives of the party would have been seriously jeopardized, and continuous conflicts with the local natives would have been inevitable. </para>

                    <para>The police on the expedition, although they did excellent work under the most trying circumstances, very naturally felt and feel a strong grievance against me for leading them through such rough country for four months, and during the last month <inline font-style="italic">(i.e.,</inline> after the raft disaster), giving them no food to eat for days together, and no' blankets or tents to protect them against the weather. They are, therefore, full of complaints of the treatment I accorded them, and are inclined to very much exaggerate every incident. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the only reply bearing on the matter that I can find. The honorable member for Ballarat questioned what I said in regard to the cost of the expedition. But the following return shows the particulars :  - </para>

The cost of the search parties, calculated on the same basis, is also set out in a table attached hereto. The total cost of the expedition and the search parties would therefore be£5,002 16s. 4d. </para>

The old, narrow view that every immigrant deprived some Australian of work has pretty well disappeared. That was an idea very prevalent at one time, but facts have completely shattered it. </para>

The newspapers report large arrivals of men and women from the Old Country almost weekly, and yet there seems to be the same demand for them in all directions. Within the last few days I heard of manufacturers who would greatly increase their operations if they could get employes. </para>

                            <para>- I have been assured on the best authority that the confectionery industry would be enormously extended if workers could be obtained, and similar representations are made by other manufacturers. I did not think that there would be found one honorable member to contradict my statement. The only time I ever was afraid to say that I was an Australian was during my last trip Home, and that was because I was so besieged with applicants for passages that I had to keep the fact quiet. I managed to get a few passages for English people, but it was impossible to get any more.I found two or three young Australians in England who had to wait for months before they could find room in a vessel coming to Australia; and I regard the position as an absolute scandal. The people desire to come here by thousands, and they are required for every industry. The Minister would be well advised if he would assist the States in the way of supplying the necessary passages for people of good old British descent. The Commonwealth regulates the mail contracts and the mail shipping, and the Minister could here take a part that in no way conflicts with the action of the Governments of the States. </para>

                            <para>- The High Commissioner is heard of in every part of the British Isles; and he is worth what is paid to him as an advertisement, quite apart from his salary. He has even appeared in great anti-fat advertisements - he appears everywhere. The miserable amount of remuneration that is paid to him is totally inadequate to the position, and on all sides there is a feeling that the representative of a country like this ought to have more means placed at his disposal. </para>

                    <para class="block">Land coming to Australia. I am desirous of receiving such people as quickly as we can assimilate them; and I think they are arriving as numerously as is safe for themselves and for the Commonwealth. I agree to a certain extent with the Leader of the Opposition as to the waste of money ; but, though I have objected to this expenditure in the past, it has been gradually getting larger. Does the Leader of the Opposition not think he has had enough of conferring with the States, especially when they are antagonistic to the Commonwealth? Whether it be a Labour Government or otherwise that is in power in a State, the moment a Federal Minister approaches them they impose such conditions as to make conference and united action impossible. No one would contend that the States should introduce what immigrants they choose. One of the conditions should be that only desirable people are introduced ; and I must say that, at any rate, a fair percentage of those now arriving are not of the class that are considered acceptable. A great number of organizations in the Motherland are desirous of getting rid of ne'er-do-wells, who, if they do not do well in ' ' fresh fields and pastures new," will, at any rate, not be a burden on those at Home. The honorable member for Ballarat and the honorable member for Fawkner tell us that every industry here can absorb more people. The fact is that, while Victorians are clamouring for work in the Government workshops, the positions are filled by immigrants from the Old Country, who, I may say, are not nearly as good workmen. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The State Governments, who have generously advertised their States at Home, feel it a point of honour to find work for the immigrants when they arrive, so as to prevent disappointment, and a probable cry of " stinking fish." I hope that, if any arrangement is made with the States, it will be seen that only desirable immigrants are brought out, and that they are not introduced in greater numbers than they can be arranged for. It seems to me that the shipping to-day is ample to bring people here as quickly as is desirable. Many immigrants are disappointed, having come here under the belief that they could get work at perhaps <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> a day. Many of the foolish advertisements by immigration agents at Home incline them to the old belief that gold can be picked up in the streets, or, at any rate, that enormous wages are obtainable. </para>

Most of us have felt the pinch of being out of work, and I do not intend that others shall suffer in that way. I am offering this protest so that what is done may be done properly. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite are serious, but they speak with different voices. Although my honorable friend, with all the seriousness that his jocund face will permit him to express, spoke of the applications for land in the country, the Attorney-General, whom he follows so slavishly, has pointed out that his party has burst up land monopoly, and that now ships enough cannot be obtained to bring out those who wish to occupy the land. Which statement is correct? My honorable friend says that we must not bring out any one unless we have a job at a good rate of pay for him to come to. The number of applicants for choice blocks in the country has nothing to do with the question. At the present time, only 5 per cent, of our people are cultivating the land, but our cultivation, per head of population, is nearly as great as that of any country in the world. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know where we are. Every honorable member opposite speaks with a different voice. It makes me wonder what tilings are like in the Caucus when the door is locked. There never was a time when Australia was more prosperous. We are told by the authority appointed by the Labour Administration in New South Wales to make an investigation that 3,500 men are wanted for secondary employments in that State, and it may, therefore, safely be assumed that Australia could to-day absorb 10,000 men in secondary employments. For every man who cultivates the land there must be eight or ten engaged in other occupations, and if our secondary employments cannot get all the labour that is needed, what is the use of bringing out more cultivators, unless we bring the others with them, seeing that our proportion of cultivation per head of population is nearly as high as that of any country in the world. </para>

                            <para>- I do not object to people being put on the land. I should like to see as many persons on the land as can find employment there. But it would be absurd to provide only for the immigration of farmers, since every man who goes on the land gives work to five or six others. What we need are healthy, strong, immigrants, able to shift for themselves in a new country, and their selection is a matter for administration at the other end- At a time like this, a bold immigration policy is needed. It would do more to preserve our present prosperity than almost anything else. It is moonshine to suppose that immigration will decrease our prosperity. </para>

He is quite correct. At Wagga, the other day, there were 1,600 applications for fourteen blocks, despite the land tax. </para>

                            <para>- One member of the Labour party says that the land tax has made land available, and another quotes figures to show that land is not available. This reference to the rush for land is a red herring drawn across the trail. Every one knows that among the applicants for land are many persons who already hold large areas. It is land hunger that accounts for the multiplication of applications, and that cannot be prevented except by an enactment providing that no man shall hold more than a certain area. Now that every one can apply, there are applicants, when choice blocks are offered, who already have plenty. That has nothing to do with immigration. I think that I had. better accept the statement of the Government that its policy has caused more immigrants to turn their faces to Australia than there are boats to bring them here. The obligation is on Ministers to find vessels. </para>

                            <para>-The vessels regularly trading to Australia may be full, but there are scores of companies in England who would send steamers here tomorrow if they could get charters for them. It is the bounden duty of the Government, in these rollicking times of prosperity, when immigrants wish to come here, to provide money for bringing them out. It is a matter of money ; but we are passing these Estimates although they do not provide for the expenditure of one penny in excess of the vote to which we agreed last year in respect of this matter. In the States where a Labour Government has succeeded to power these votes are being cut down, so that whilst we have the Labour party shouting from the house tops in one breath, that they favour immigration, in the next, we have them saying, in effect, that immigration is unnecessary. This is about the most serious; question within the whole of our political purview. There is nothing mysterious, subtle, or occult associated with the problem. We have only to do the work lying to our hands, and all that we want at present is a substantial vote ,to provide facilities for bringing people to Australia to help us to secure it for all time, and also to secure their own happiness. </para>

                        <para>.- I have a somewhat serious indictment to make against th'e Government in regard to a matter affecting my own electorate. In the division before us I see provision made for a contribution to the funds of the Imperial Institute, and for a proposed vote of ,£5,000 in respect of the Antarctic expedition under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mawson.</inline> Last year a sum of ,£2,500 was voted for the assistance of sufferers by the -Bolton colliery disaster, and £1,500 to assist British settlers in the New Hebrides. I take no exception to any grant in relief of distress, or in furtherance of scientific research, believing that it is only right that the Commonwealth should devote some of its funds in this direction. There is, however, an old saying, that charity begins at home, and I think that the Government of Australia might well spend some of its surplus revenue in, alleviating distress occasioned by disasters within the Commonwealth. In the early part of the year the town of Port Douglas was visited by a cyclone which completely devastated it, the only buildings left standing being, I may state for the information of the honorable member for Brisbane, a public-house and the post-office. The population o'f the town is not more than 1,000, and probably its insignificance was responsible for the decision of the Government that no grant should be made to alleviate the distress caused by this visitation,. There was some loss of life, and the cyclone was followed almost immediately by a flood, with the result that people who had been rendered homeless were reduced almost to starvation. Owing to the flooded state of the country there was no possibility of assistance. Steamer traffic was delayed, as the result of the rough weather, and many people were left homeless and foodless*. The  President  of the Shire Council wired to the Prime Minister asking that Government assistance should be granted to the suffierers, but he received 'a reply that, in the opinion of the right honorable gentleman, assistance in the circumstances could not be granted. I was at Cairns at the time, and the Shire  President  also telegraphed to me urging me to plead with the Prime Minister to grant some assistance to the sufferers. I at once wired to the Prime Minister ; but, although nine or ten months have elapsed, I have not yet received a reply. I believe, as a matter of fact, that some two month's after the application had been made, the Cabinet considered the matter, and decided that it was one of purely local concern, in which Commonwealth assistance could not be rendered. The Government had their own officials on the spot, and it was their bounden duty to instruct them! to report on the extent of the damage, and upon the question of whether or not the application for relief was a justifiable one. I repeat that charity should begin at home, and that our own people should be looked1 after as well as people on the other side of the world. We voted a large sum to the Waratah Search Fund, and also made a grant for the relief of sufferers by the Sicilian earthquake. </para>

Despite what the honorable member for Port Melbourne has said, there are many vacant positions te be filled. A conference between the Treasurer of Victoria and a large number of employers of labour, as well as some representatives of the Trades Hall, decided that) a very considerable number of craftsmen in various branches of industry were absolutely required to carry on works in progress in the city of Melbourne and its vicinity, and that fact goes largely to discount the statement made this evening by the honorable member for Melbourne. Ports. There is a still more important consideration having reference to our rural workers. Every holder of land in Victoria finds his operations crippled at present because it is impossible to obtain the hands necessary to properly carry on his work* </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will find himself just as helpless during the recess as he is in this House while Parliament is in session. We also require a large number of men to enter upon the occupation and cultivation of the land. In Victoria, we are making strenuous efforts, under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mead,</inline> to settle the people on irrigable lands, and very large irrigation enterprises are now being entered upon. Although it is possible that, in many cases where land is thrown open for selection there is a plethora of applicants, nevertheless, the policy being pursued in this State is resulting in a large number of families being settled on land  where hitherto there has been only one. The same remark will apply to New South Wales, where, with the completion of the Burrenjuck  scheme, the land so to be supplied with water will be capable of supporting a very large population. The whole outlook in this regard is promising. But, no matter how loudly we proclaim- our determination to maintain our White Australia policy, we shall find it impossible long to continue to hold Australia unless we settle it with white people. Whilst our population is equal only to but one and a half to the square mile, it is absolutely absurd to talk about having anything like the settlement that is necessary. I should like the Minister to explain the item " Expenses in connexion with Father Shaw's wireless telegraphy station in Papua." From this it appears that the Government have entered into a private contract with an individual, and are carrying on wireless telegraphy through his efforts. Is that the case, and if so, is the same policy to be pursued in other parts of the Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>.- We have endeavoured for the last ten years to make known the advantages of immigration to Australia by a system of advertising which is now bearing fruit ; but the present state of affairs is due, not only to the efforts of the Commonwealth, but also to the combined efforts of the States. We have in the High Commissioner a first-class asset. He has done a great deal to advertise our resources. The previous  speaker  drew attention to the Conference held recently in Victoria, where all parties represented unanimously agreed that more mechanics were required in Victoria. In Sydney a Royal Commission appointed by the present Labour Government also reported that a large number of mechanics were required to meet the requirements of industry and trade in New South Wales. Statements have been made in this House from time to time, on the authority of Ministers, that the public works of the Commonwealth cannot be carried out because of the dearth of men for the purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say it is the duty of this Parliament to find a job for every man who comes to Australia ; but if we have faith in our country we ought to believe that it can carry 100,000,000 people. At no period in our history have the avenues of employment been open more widely than they are at present ; and where we can fill up those avenues only to create further employment in other directions, we ought to seize every opportunity for doing so. Any member of this Parliament who says that Australia is fully populated is acting as a traitor to his country. The Commonwealth, with its broad acres and magnificent resources, is only waiting for an influx of a desirable class of people to develop it. If the public works of the Commonwealth were properly undertaken, we should have room at once for tens of thousands of people, not men who are trained to any particular trade, but men who could engage in construction work. We have also a large number of vacancies in connexion with our industries. The building trade in the country districts is in many instances at a standstill because it is impossible to get men to go there from Melbourne to fill the places waiting for them. </para>

                            <para>- The only thing that will prevent a full supply of material to the builders is the want of labour to saw the timber in the forests. We have reached a stage in our history when the lack ot a vigorous immigration policy may seriously jeopardize our safety, or at any rate lessen the chances of . maintaining a European population within our borders. There is no difficulty in any of the States in absorbing immigrants. A much wider field than those I have mentioned is offering in the development of the mineral riches of some of the States, but all these avenues are subordinate to the great question of settling the people on the land. The Victorian Government undertook a vigorous immigration policy, courageously sending a delegation to the Old World. This has been most fruitful in its results; and yet Victoria cannot get enough people to absorb the land available, while the other States are in an infinitely better position than Victoria by reason of their, larger areas. Plenty of people are ready to come from Great Britain to occupy Australian lands, as well as to follow other avocations. All that we require is to charter ships to bring them here. The Commonwealth never had a more overflowing Treasury, and never will it be more easy to supply the money for that essential purpose. If the Government continue to palter with this serious question, they will lay themselves open to a charge of grave dereliction of duty, and of not acting patriotically in the interests of the country which they are charged to govern. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like the honorable member for Wimmera to specify the particular public works which are hung up for want of labour. That is the first thing he must do in order to prove his assertions. It is easy to make general statements about the scarcity of labour, but when the Commonwealth Government advertised for 300 hands in the Small Arms Factory, there were about 1,800 applicants. </para>

The New South Wales Railways Commissioners have hundreds on their books wanting employment in their Department. Most of the immigrants who come out are sent to the Commissioners for employment.

                            <para>- Since that report was published, more than the number who were said to be required have come to the country. Two steamers have lately arrived with 1,200 immigrants each. The mere fact that we have prosperous times is the best advertisement that Australia could have in the Old Country. Every steamer booked to leave England for Australia for the next twelve months has her passenger-list full. Surely we do not require to go any further in that direction. Australia has been well advertised, and immigrants are coming here of their own accord. </para>

                            <para>- If we overdo the thing we shall have unemployed in our cities, and that fact will injure us greatly. It is far better to absorb the immigrants as they come here than to overload the market with labour and create stagnation that will immediately react upon the flow of population to our shores. The High Commissioner in England, and the delegation that recently went from this Parliament have done as much to advertise Australia as if we spent another £20,000 for the purpose. In the Newcastle district there are hundreds of men out of employment. It would be a crying shame' to bring miners or bring unskilled labour here, although I believe there is a scarcity of skilled labour in the way of bricklayers, masons, and so forth, but that is only for a time. I do not want to encourage a wholesale system of immigration. Rents in Sydney and Melbourne have gone up considerably, because so many people have come here and are seeking accommodation. The people already here get no advantage from that. I can understand men with property wanting more immigrants to keep rents up, and I can understand men in business wanting them. ' </para>

                            <para>- The cost of materials has increased, but wages have not increased in proportion. Timber that used to cost 9s. per 100 feet costs 18s. to-day, and bricks which used to cost £1 ros. per 1,000 now cost £2 19s. That is due to the operation of combines, and will continue until we have power to regulate combines. I shall oppose any increase in this vote until there is proper justification for it. When we want men for the transcontinental railway and other big works and cannot get them, it will be time enough to bring them here. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather pleased with a good deal of what has been said during the last few minutes. Before the last general election we were told that if the Labour party came into power there would not be ships enough to take the people away from Australia. Now, however, we are told that there are not ships enough to bring people here. When the and tax was imposed, it was prophesied that confidence in Australia would be lost, and yet honorable members of the Opposition declare now that Australia was never more prosperous, and people never more anxious to come and share in that prosperity. I was a little surprised at the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that we ought not to spend the full amount of £20,000 in advertising Australia. I understood him ' to say that it was unnecessary to spend a large portion of that sum, seeing that Australia was now well-advertised, and people were coming here, and that it would be better to use the money in providing shipping facilities. </para>

                        <para>The figures of. net immigration into Australia since 1861 are very interesting. The average from i86r to 1890 was 15,000 a year. The average from  1891  to IQ08 was 3,150 a year. The figures for 1910 showed a gain of 37,500, or 9,000 more than the whole gain from 1891 to 1908. </para>

                        <para>The shipping companies, I find, thoroughly realize the urgent necessity of providing more ships, especially ships with third-class accommodation, to cope with the greatly increasing traffic. The companies, however, will not be able to fully meet this demand for some time to come. The total tonnage of ships just completed <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> under construction for the Australian trade is about 200,000 tons gross. The Federal Steam Navigation Co. have two new steamers in course of construction, the <inline font-style="italic">Shropshire</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Wiltshire.</inline> Both of these ships, which have a capacity of over. 6,000 tons, have excellent accommodation for both first-class and third-class passengers. Messrs. Turnbull, Martin and Co. (the Shire-Line) have a similar vessel nearing completion. The P. and O. Steam Navigation Co. are building two new steamers for the Australia mail service, while the P. and O. Branch Service steamers, the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Bendigo,</inline> will come into commission towards the end of 1911. Each of these ships will accommodate about 1,000 to 1,200 " One-Class " passengers. The Ocean Steamship Co. inform me that they intend building new ships for the Australian trade at an early date. Messrs. Ismay,  Imrie   and Co., too, have steamers under consideration for the Australian trade. The Orient Co.'s new ship, the <inline font-style="italic">Or ama,</inline> will probably be ready about November, 191 1, and will have  accommodation  for about 750 third-class passengers. Thompson and Co.'s new ships, the <inline font-style="italic">1'hemistoctes</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Demosthenes,</inline> will be capable of dealing with at least 750 third-class passengers each. </para>

If the Commonwealth were to bring out a large number of immigrants and land them in one of the States, and there happened to be a lack of employment, even momentarily, the whole blame would be cast upon us for interfering. </para>

                            <para>- He did not deny what I am now saying. I saw from the newspapers that the Premier had been asked to subsidize the immigration of Russians, but that he had replied that he was prepared to spend the money in introducing English people. These Russians, however, never asked for any subsidy, but came, as I say, on their own account. Quite a number of them came in the same steamer as that in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> returned from England. If the Commonwealth Government brought out a number of immigrants, we should have to land some of them in each' of the States; and we might find the Queensland Government informing us that their depots were full, and that they did not desire us to interfere. I am not prepared to advocate any interference with the arrangements of the States. If the States are anxious to be associated with us, and they approach us unitedly, I do not say the Commonwealth will not be prepared to meet them; but until then, I for one am not prepared to do anything in the matter. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to be surprised. The present situation is entirely novel in our history. A large number of eligible persons are desirous of leaving the Mother Country for Australia, and the shipping companies at present trading here have lately raised their rates, thus further indicating their inability to convey those immigrants here. This is an entirely new position; and if I were Minister, looking at the matter from a party point of view, the first thing I should do would be to consult the States, in order to compel them to shoulder their responsibility. The Minister need not give a proportional number of the immigrants to each State, because, so long as sufficient land is provided somewhere, he would have fulfilled his obligations. Then the responsibility would rest with the States. I said, further, that even if the States stood out, the Commonwealth Government are in a position to make their own inquiries, and determine for themselves where settlers can be provided for at once. I believe the result would be gratifying to the Minister, who would be enabled to enter into other arrangements if the steam-ship companies cannot or will not attempt to meet the situation </para>

It seems to me the most simple and natural business transaction for the Government to bring those desirable settlers here. We have to be satisfied that they are desirable, since we know that there are splendid opportunities for them in Australia. The responsibility is ours, but it directly rests on the shoulders of this Government. They can easily discharge it to the great and permanent advantage of this country if they have courage. Let them not affect to be afraid of offending the susceptibilities of the States. This is the first time I have heard of any such alarm on this score, and I hope it will be the last. </para>

I am informed that men are now being dismissed from work on the Federal Territory. I think I have been in close contact with every unemployed movement here in the last twenty-one years. I would like the honorable member for Wimmera to see the number of names registered at the Labour Bureau at the corner of King and Bourke-streets, the number registered for Commonwealth employment on the second floor of the Customs House, and the number registered for State employment in the Public Service Commissioner's office behind the Treasury. If he went to those places, he would not say that there is ample employment for all. I do not accuse him of wishing to have here three men for every billet. I should like to see three billets for every man. </para>

                            <para>- Many of them are. I was connected with three bodies of immigrants who caine to Australia, one numbering 120, another 80, and the third nearly 200, but as a medical man I had only to examine them to ascertain whether they bore vaccination marks. Persons who should not have been permitted to come because of their state of health came because I had no power to prevent them. I do not know whether the regulations are better now. Surely, we do not desire that the population of our capitals shall be increased. The population of Melbourne is now more than 600,000, and numbers nearly half the population of Victoria. Nowhere else in the world are the capital cities so large in proportion to the population of the country as in Australia. The honorable member for Calare told us of a family which landed in Adelaide, sent out by a British charity organization, without a penny. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member did not have such land as mine. With regard to the vote of £350 for the assistance of the settlers in the New Hebrides, I think that tha expenditure is opposed to our Protective policy, which should not be impaired. I would rather pay money directly than refund duties. I visited the New Hebrides about three years ago, and do not know why persons prefer to go there instead of to Queensland, where it is easy to get land. All the work done in the New Hebrides is performed by coloured labour, but in Australia white men have to be employed. When I paid my visit, a subsidy was being granted on condition that black labour should not be used, and while white crews  were carried  as far as Vila, the work from there on was done by coloured crews. I would not reduce the subsidy paid to Burns, Philp, and Company, because we  get a splendid return for it. I visited the islands as a keen critic of the way in which the kanaka is treated, and had reason to praise what I saw being done. </para>

The United States of America allow their countrymen, when stranded abroad, to go to their Consuls, who, on their citizenship being proved, send them back. </para>

                            <para>- I had a talk to the High Commissioner, and that splendid representative of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Taverner, and they told me that pitiable cases sometimes came under their notice, which they were comparatively helpless to assist. The Agents-General desire to act with the High Commissioner in this matter, and would like a fund established to provide for the return of Australians. The expenditure to this end should be greater than it was last year, when it amounted to £102. We should not permit Australians to become a charge on the rates of the Old Country, but should bring them back here, where they will have a better chance of earning a living. I would rather see assistance given to settlers in the Northern Territory than to settlers in the New Hebrides. We should build railways there, open up the land, and send settlers to populate it, helping them when there. The Leader of the Opposition will bear out the statement that the men sent to the Victorian village settlements were put on land which will not feed a goat in many instances. They built their homes, and planted their gardens - and frequently their bodies in the cemeteries - but had no chance of making a living. </para>

                            <para>- It was not the fault of Ministers, but had they been given good land they would have done well. If we all joined hands in the matter of developing the Northern Territory, we should be in a position to welcome there as many white persons as cared to come. Should provide those who go there with medical attention, and make a scientific investigation into tropical diseases, with a. view to bringing about the conditions under which population will thrive. I understand that there is very rich land on some of the rivers, which are larger than any others that we possess. Queensland has the lowest death-rate in the world, and, probably, with proper scientific direction, white men could develop the Northern Territory, and keep it for future generations of our people. </para>

There is something very wrong if that is really the case, with a Labour Government in power, which is spending  £3,500,000  of loan, money. Then, again, the honorable member for Melbourne, who has just resumed his seat, told us that, in spite of the operation of the big, crushing, bursting-up Federal land tax during the last twelve months, it is most difficult to obtain land. </para>

Every Federal Government, and every Labour Minister of External Affairs hitherto, has always declared that immigration is a national affair ; but now, for the first time, we have a Minister of External Affairs declaring that it is a State undertaking, notwithstanding that, under the Constitution, we have power to ileal with it. 1 should like to know where the " State frighters  " are now. The Minister says that he dare not do anything in this regard lest his actions might be resented by the States. This Minister is, for the first time in the history of the Federation, turning down immigration as a national question, and declaring it to be a purely State matter. I desire to know whether the Minister has made any representations to the High Commissioner, since he has been in office, in regard to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> provision of shipping accommodation for immigrants? </para>

                            <para>- Yes; these undertakings are not being carried out as we should have conducted them ; we should have carried them through with a great deal less taxation ; but we were not permitted to do so. That, however, is a matter of the past, and I am not going into a detailed criticism of the Estimates of this Department. As long as the Government keep on spending millions, as they are doing, for defence, I shall only say, " Good luck to you; go ahead !" How long they will do that, however, I am unable to say In this connexion I wish to refer to an ungenerous and impudent statement made last Saturday by the Attorney-General in that celebrated column of his, " The Case for Labour." I am sorry that he is not well; but I see no evidence of illness in " The Case for Labour " that he reels off from week to week. It suggests that he is in particularly good health, and I am glad to see in it evidence of great mental vigour. In the course of his usual weekly article he wrote of the Opposition last Saturday - </para>

                            <para>- Is that all? I shall not argue the question, but apparently the honorable member did not relish my references to taxation. The facts are on record, and I merely stated them. I repeat that if one desired -to criticise these Estimates, one could find plenty of material. I do not think that there has been a time since Federation when so many large and new salaries have been provided for on the Estimates, as those to which we are now asked to agree. These Estimates are full of new offices, carrying tip-top salaries. I believe most of them to be necessary ; but there are one or two matters to which I desire to call attention. First of all, I should like to know who are the members of the Naval Board. The first na.val member is, I presume, Admiral Creswell, who is. down for a salary of £1,200 a year, 01 aru increase of £300 per annum. The second naval member is set down to receive £1,000 a year, and I should like to know who. he is. Then, again, the third naval member is to receive £900 a year, and yet another £750 per annum. I call attention to the difference in the payment of these officers. I venture to say that none of these members of the Board have hitherto received, man for man, more than the members of the Military Board have received. We have now a complete reversal of the old order of things. Whereas the members of the Military Board had the advantage in point of salary, the advantage now goes to the naval side. The land defences of Australia, when in thorough going order, will cost in the way of upkeep three or four limes as much as will the naval side. Yet the members of the Military Board are receiving much lower salaries than are the members of the Naval Board. The Chief of the General Staff receives £1,200. There is a reduction there from £1,500, but that officer and the Chief Naval Officer will be on an equality as regards pay. The second Naval Member receives £1,000 a year, and the Adjutant-General receives only £684. The third Naval Member receives £900 a year, and the Quartermaster-General £750. The Quartermaster-General of the Commonwealth, who has such a tremendous responsibility in connexion with the new scheme of land training, should receive more than that, in view of the salaries paid to members of the Naval Board. Why this complete reversal of the conditions? The salaries of the members of the Military Bo?.rd are as follow : - Adjutant-General £684. Chief of Ordnance £700, Quartermaster-General £750, Secretary £420. These salaries are very low considering the responsibilities attached to the positions. No change is made in them, but there ls a great lift in the salaries paid to the members of the Naval Board. Will the Minister explain the reason for it ? Another new staff is being set up in connexion with the Naval Department. There is a Director of Naval .Reserves, a Director of Naval Works, and a Naval Adviser to the High Commissioner. All these are to get salaries of from £800 to £850. I am not complaining of the salaries on the naval side being pitched pretty high, but why this great discrepancy between the Military and Naval Staffs? Later on I shall challenge the item regarding the Area Officers, and move its reduction by £1 to test the question of their pay. </para>

                            <para>- There may have to be an appointment to that rank, because we do not happen to have another officer of the same rank in Australia. It is customary in all such positions to start officers at what may be termed the bottom of their class, permitting them to rise by certain stages to the highest figure. Practically the officers on the Naval Board are here under what may be termed contracts. They have to lay down the whole of the scheme for the new Navy for Australia, and so have to be experts. The salaries paid to them are presumed to be in accordance with their expert knowledge, the special work they have to do, and the rank they hold. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister's explanation does not get us much " forrarder  " so far as the military go. I do not think the naval salaries are at all too high, always providing that care is taken to get men who are worth the money. The salary of £1,500 for the Chief of the General Staff was only brought into existence three years ago. The present Minister did it, and why he is taking it down now by £300 a year I do not know. Major-General Hoad received £1,500 a year as Chief of the General Staff, and as Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. The next occupant of the post must be the best man obtainable in the Forces, and directly he is appointed to the position he must be made Major-General. We have now in the service two or three Brigadier-Generals. Among those I recall now are Brigadier-General Bridges and Brigadier-General Gordon. One of the anomalies of the military service is that an officer is not paid according to the work he does, but according to his rank. That often works out unjustly, and is doing so in the case of the members of the Military Board. The last Adjutant-General was paid £800 a year.  His  successor is receiving £684 per annum. No matter how good a man may be, or what work he is doing, unless he has the rank he cannot get the pay. Some provision ought to be made, so that while he does the work he should get the pay. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be glad to help the honorable member to assist the bottom dog when we get to him. Just now, we are dealing with the big mastiffs of the service. Whenever a man takes a position for which his rank does not qualify him to receive the pay, it will be very easy for the Treasurer to make up the pay to him temporarily while he is doing the work. The salaries of the members of the Military Board could all be liberally revised without doing injustice to any one else. Men who control a service such as this is, and such as it is destined to become, deserve higher salaries than are set down here. It is true that in the British service the pay of a naval officer is slightly more than that of a military officer, but at Home the land defences have not nearly the importance of the naval defences. It is much, a bigger job to be in the navy than in the army there, but here, at present, the reverse is the case. Even when these schemes are in full working order, we shall be spending about three times as much per annum on land as on naval defence. Our naval defence ought, as soon as possible, to take first place in importance, as it is our first line of defence. Hitherto, we have treated it as our second line. Who is the Director of Naval Reserves at £850 a year? </para>

                        <para>. - What is proposed to be done in regard to the appointment of a manager? Commander Clarkson seems to be allowed to do pretty well as he chooses, and is a most fortunate man in being able to select his own work. He was engaged to go to the other end of the world to superintend all arrangements in connexion with the factory ; and, before his departure, was given an engagement as manager at £800 a year. I believe his salary at that time was something like £400 ;. but now he is receiving £900 as the third member of the Naval Board. Is he still engaged at the Small Arms Factory ? </para>

                            <para>- What steps are being taken towards making a permanent appointment? Apparently, a position worth £1,000 a year is going begging. Are we to pass this vote of £1,000 for a manager, and is Commander Clarkson to receive it instead of his present £900? What is Commander Clarkson's definite occupation to be in the Department ? Either a manager ought to be appointed, or one of these salaries ought to be eliminated. We cannot obtain rifles from Home without a long wait after the placing of the order; and we require nothing so much as arms and  ammunition in Australia. The factory is more than twelve months overdue, although the American firm obtained the contract simply because they undertook to complete it months before the English firms could do so. There never was a more unsatisfactory piece of business ; and we cannot obtain any explanation. It is time there was a straightforward statement made to the public. </para>

Here we have a staff of nine clerks, and yet there are not more than fifty people employed at the factory. When I was there in October, the machinery was standing still ; and, though the office is one of the most up-to-date and best-equipped I ever saw, it seems to represent an extravagance under the circumstances. Some of these officials have been about the place for a long time, and if we are not to obtain any rifles, it would seem to be a most unusual and unnecessary arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- The factory will turn out some thousands of rifles annually, and there will be a good deal of clerical work in connexion with their manufacture and distribution. Replying to the honorable member for Parramatta, what he terms a full and complete statement of the position of affairs has not been made, because the Attorney-General may have to be consulted. It is possible that an investigation may have to be carried back to a time before this Government took office. I am not suggesting that any former Minister was to blame in any way, but, under the circumstances, it would not be fair to the Department, or to the contractors, to publish statements which might prejudice the case of any party. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not understand the reference to an investigation going back to a time prior to this Government accepting office. I hope that there will be such an investigation, but I have yet to know that the possibility of it is any reason why the public should not know how the work of constructing and equipping the factory is progressing, and why there has been delay in the production of rifles. Is it due to any remissness on our part, or is it because machinery has not come to hand quickly enough ? Commander C'larkson was sent to the other side of the world to superintend matters in connexion with the factory, and begged to be permitted to stay there, and when he was brought back, instead of being made manager of the factory, as was intended, has been made a member of the Naval Board. Is it intended eventually to make him manager of the Small Arms Factory ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We hear complaints about things not going as they should, and about defective machinery, and possibly it is because there is not a competent person in charge. Commander Clarkson's salary last year was set down at £600, but this year he is to get £900, and the manager of the factory is to receive . £1,000. I do not say that the position is not worth the salary, but we should be careful not to pay too much, because our defence expenditure is increasing by leaps and bounds. The sum set down for the factory has increased from . £1,175 last  year to £3,191 this year, though, of course, the expense must be larger because this year the place will be in going order. While we are paying £1,000 to a manager, we are giving only £1,100 to eight clerks, so that they will get the paltry wage of about £137 each. I hope that the man at the top is not going to be paid an exorbitant salary and those under him less than they should receive. It is time that the factory was in working order, under the control of a competent man. Without a competent man mistakes must be made, and work improperly done. Indeed, it would hardly be worth while going on without a competent manager. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable members ought to visit the factory. It is one of the most marvellous in the world. For the first time, it will be possible to manufacture a gun without the application of manual labour. It is all very well for those who have no mechanical knowledge to complain about the time taken to equip the factory, but the machinery is very complicated, a great deal of it being new, not only in this part of the world, but in the Old Country- When the factory is completed, it will be the only one where it will be possible to make and test a gun without the employment of skilled labour or the touch of human hands. I do not know whether Commander Clarkson should or should not be made manager of the factory - the honorable member for Parramatta may be right in what he said about that - but certainly a competent man should be put in charge of it. In setting up an establishment such as a small arms factory, there is much room for delay without any fault on the part "of those in charge. The officers in charge of the Small Arms Factory are, after all, only human, and may err in regard to the machinery that is required. I hope that honorable members will not be too severe in their condemnation unless they have some mechanical knowledge, and a knowledge also of the plant that is requisite in such a factory. The machinery is most interesting, and would well repay a visit of inspection by honorable members. It is so accurate that it is able to test whether a gun is even the thousandth part of an inch out of "true." Then, again, the electrical machinery used is a remarkable piece of work. It is an output of the Fitzroy Dock, and it is really a pleasure to watch it working. I am not here to excuse the Government in regard to any question of management ; but I am confident that if those who have spoken had possessed some mechanical knowledge, they would not have indulged in the reflections which they have made. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the honorable member for Hunter, I desire to say that the delay has been occasioned, not by the absence of a manager or person superintending the erection of the factory and the placing of machinery in position, but by unforeseen circumstances. Captain Clarkson has been acting as manager throughout. I agree with the honorable member that it is time the factory was in operation, but unforeseen delays have occurred. As to the position of clerks, I would point out that men are ranked as clerks irrespective of their age, and that every clerk employed at the factory will receive the rate of pay for which the regulations provide. There will be no attempt to employ adults at a rate of pay that is not commensurate with the duties they perform. </para>

I desire to impress upon the Minister that, whilst there may be something to be said for the establishment of various factories in the Federal Capital, if the Federal Territory is not suitable for any particular Government factory, the Cabinet should take into consideration the desirableness of adopting a policy of decentralization. We have the Harness and Clothing Factories in Melbourne, and it may perhaps be argued that it is essential that they should be carrying on operations here ; but it is a bad policy to bring all such establishments into either Melbourne, Sydney, or any other State capital. Art  attempt ought to be made to establish them outside our principal cities.  1  have in my own electorate, at Warrnambool, a site that is suitable for a woollen cloth factory, and there are sites in other electorates. I rose only to urge upon the Ministry the desirableness of instructing the manager to give special consideration to suitable sites outside our large cities. </para>

I shall be prepared to be guided solely by the decision of. the expert, in whom I .have every confidence, and I trust that the Government will give him every opportunity to visit Hobart arid inspect the building to which I have referred. A gentleman who, for two years, was a lecturer at. our University, and whom I met recently at Neuchatel, told me that, although he has travelled widely, he knows of no place more suitable than is Hobart for educational establishments. Our magnificent climate lends itself to the building up of intellectual, as well as physical, vigour, and in order to demonstrate the anxiety of the State Government to work hand in hand with the Commonwealth in regard to this matter, I propose to quote from a letter addressed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliott</inline> Lewis, Premier of that State, when he learned from newspaper reports that I was moving with the object of securing the establishment of a temporary Naval College at Hobart - </para>

                        <para>My Government would be prepared in every way in its power to facilitate the transfer to the Commonwealth Government, free of cost, of such portion of Derwent Park as might be deemed necessary, and as is at present unappropriated for other purposes, or any other Crown  land  on the Derwent that might be considered more suitable. </para>

                    <para>Later on he wrote to me placing under offer the use of the building to which I have referred I am informed that it is not necessary that the College should be near the waterside, but in the Derwent River we have a harbor which the captain of one of our big ocean-going steamers has told me is absolutely unequalled. Another point to be remembered in this connexion is that we are about to tap the natural power in our Lake district, which is only  65  miles from Hobart, so that, whereas horse-power there now costs about ,£30 per annum, the installation of this electrical power will reduce it to ^£10 per annum. Any machinery required in connexion with the College could be driven in Hobart cheaper than is possible on the mainland. Time will not permit me to refer to the facilities offering at Norfolk Bay. but I may mention that the men of the British war-ships on the Australian Station, after being almost frizzled in other parts of Australia, annually spend some time there. The vessels of the Squadron visit Hobart, and go on to Norfolk Bay, where unequalled facilities for target practice exist. We have every facility in die neighbourhood of Hobart for educating the young men whom we desire to place in what, I hope, will be a Navy equal to that of any other country ; and I feel sure, judging by the courtesy with which Ministers have received my representations, that they will give this matter their most earnest consideration before any site is fixed upon for a temporary or permanent Naval College. </para>

The Prime Minister told us that he would give us an opportunity to take a vote on the matter. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the Opposition will do so. The Government are making a serious mistake in proposing to institute a search all over Australia for a site for a temporary College, on which a lot of money will be wasted. It is an unwise policy, and I should like to move, in order to test the question, that the proposed vote be reduced by ,£1. Burraneer Point is not in my electorate, but the decision to turn down the recommendation in favour of the establishment of the College there was practically the result of a debate in this House at a time when most of the representatives of New South Wales were absent. I have never seen the place, which is not near my electorate, and could not benefit me in any way. It seems peculiar to send an expert round and then turn his recommendations down because some members of the House asked that the site should be fixed elsewhere. </para>

The same principle is being followed with regard to the Woollen Factory. Managers and clerks are being appointed, and money is being voted, but no one knows where it is to be. The Government made a mistake in departing from the recommendation of their expert regarding the site for the Naval College, and the Opposition ought to have challenged their action. The Government have wobbled too much on the question. </para>

                        <para>- - I wish to take this opportunity of dealing with the very unsatisfactory condition of affairs relating to wireless telegraphy that has often been referred to in the House. The subject has hitherto been dealt with mainly by the Postmaster-General, but this division deals with the subject of schools for gunnery, torpedo, and wireless. Besides, I find no express provision in the Postmaster-General's Estimates relating to it any more than there is in this, and the subject is one which more intimately concerns naval defence than anything else. The position of affairs with regard to wireless seems to be very peculiar. The Government, through their spokesman, the Postmaster-General, stated in the strongest possible way that the establishment of wireless posts around the coast of Australia was a matter of extreme urgency. No one will dispute it, but what is the actual state of affairs? It may not be entirely their own fault, but the Government are in a peculiar position. </para>

I desire to take exception to the fact that sufficient provision is not made on the Naval Estimates for the appointment of wireless stations generally, or for schools of instruction in connexion with them. There are two matters which are distinct' from one another. The first relates to the contract for the erection of two stations, one at Fremantle and the other near Sydney, to which the honorable member  for Fremantle has on more than one occasion referred. I shall say nothing with regard to the unsatisfactory condition into which matters have got with regard to that contract, but I wish to dell with the proposal brought forward for the establishment of other stations. </para>

                    <para>According to the statement made by the Postmaster-General, it is proposed to establish wireless stations at Melbourne, Hobart, Port Moresby, and Cooktown or Thursday Island. We are told that the Government, instead of adopting the course which Governments almost universally adopt when they have the financial power to do so - purchasing the necessary patent rights to enable them to deal effectually with such a complicated question - propose, apparently, to take up some undefined system that is recommended to them, by an expert of their own. That expert is admitted to be a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie.</inline> He was recently the manager of a radio-telegraphic company which was successfully sued by the Marconi company. He has, therefore, come out here as the representative of a company which was found <inline font-style="italic">in flagrante  delicto- found</inline> actually in infringement of an existing system. That, in itself, does not go too far to recommend that gentleman's advice. This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> about whom I know personally nothing, except what I have stated, has, apparently, some system of his own. The Government are prepared, instead of purchasing already patented rights in Australia, to enable them safely to put a wireless system into force, to adopt some system about which there is a good deal of mystery, and which has been suggested or invented by that gentleman. The Postmaster-General made this rather peculiar pronouncement on the matter - </para>

                        <para>We are following the advice of the expert that was engaged by the Prime Minister when he was in London, as to the system we are about to adopt. In view of the trouble that has arisen between the Marconi and Telefunken Companies, we may, at some future time, as a Commonwealth, have to defend parts of the apparatus comprising the system which, after careful consideration, will be registered in the name of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">I suppose the Postmaster-General meant that it would be registered in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> and transferred to the Commonwealth, which is the mode provided by the Act - </para>
                    <para>I cannot guarantee that we shall be clear, but if we infringe rights in any way the Government will accept the responsibility of paying reasonable compensation for the infringement. </para>
                    <para>That policy, announced by the Postmaster-General, represents an entirely unstable attitude, and One which cannot be maintained. In the first place, assuming that the Government proceed to carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie'</inline> s arrangement, they cannot rest upon paying compensation or damages. I suppose they can pay damages, which may amount to a great deal of money, but after paying damages they may be stopped from using the works. </para>

                            <para>- My difficulty is that there is so much mystery about the whole thing. The one plain, straight; forward way that has hitherto been adopted by all Governments is to directly secure the rights which this Parliament has created and given to the people who hold them. In that case the Government say - " We want to take those rights. We need not give you your price, but we will have them valued by arbitration." That is the way which has been adopted in England, America, and, I believe, in Germany and most other civilized communities. Instead of doing this, apparently the Government propose to say - " We are not going to act under section 92, but we shall assume that the Marconi patent, which already supplies practically the whole of the mercantile marine of the world, and is installed in most of the navies of the world, and the Telefunken patent, which is owned by a company of some standing, can be put aside as if they do not exist." </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The Marconi Company has recently been successful in a very important litigation in England, but the Government say - " We are going to have a certain system brought forward by a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> and we shall fight <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie's</inline> battles for him, and if we are beaten we shall pay all damages." That is a most ineffectual way of going to work. I do not think the Postmaster-General, or his legal adviser, will dispute the fact that, if they do not act under sections 92 to 96 of the Patents Act, by coming to an agreement with the Marconi Company, the Telefunken Company, and other owners of patents, the Government will be liable to be stopped by an injunction. The other parties have the same rights against the Government that they have against any private individual ; and the Government will be forced to " climb down." In the meantime, all works and operations will have to be stopped, and the Marconi companies and others will have to be approached with the request to agree on terms. </para>

There is a very wise provision in our Patents laws, that the Defence Department may become the possessor of patent rights, and if it does so, may seal up everything connected with them in order that foreign nations may not get the benefit of the discovery. But does that apply to this case ? In the very next sentence the Postmaster-General says - </para>

                    <para>But consider the position. Here, in a matter most vital to the interests of the Commonwealth, the Government have decided to take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie's</inline> system, which may be good or utterly bacl. It may be some entirely new idea that has never occurred to the Marconi or the Telefunken people, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Oliver</inline> Lodge, or any of the other experts, or it may be simply a. modification of the system already determined to be an infringement of the invention of those other parties. All we know is that the Government are going to adopt this system, thinking it is protected in some way by section 92 - the Minister is going to put his head in the sand, "and take the consequences. Surely the straightforward course is that usually adopted by any civilized Government, namely, to say to the parties, " We have given you patent rights under our law, but we require them for public purposes, and have a right to take them, and we shall pay what arbitrators say is a fair price." </para>
                    <para class="block">But the Government are taking something - we are not told what - some idea, which may be nothing more than a modification of the infringement - and are doing this under a veil of mystery, prepared to " stand the racket." I desire to point out to Ministers and the Committee that this " racket " may be something different from what Ministers expected. It may not be a mere matter of paying damages. The works may be stopped by order of the Court until the Government are obliged to do what they ought to do now - approach those persons whose patent rights they desire, and pay a price fixed by arbitration. That is not the position in which the Government of Australia ought to allow themselves to be placed. I am not going to pronounce an opinion that this will be an infringement, because I know nothing of the- system or of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> more than he was formerly the manager of the company which was beaten. </para>

                            <para>-  The Minister will find, when he has to do with patents., that he is treading a very thorny path. Wireless telegraphy was first thought of in connexion with Defence, and Defence considerations were urged as the reason for the establishment of stations. At the preliminary investigation,  Colonel McCay  and Admiral Creswell were present. It is proposed to establish, in connexion with the Defence Department, a school for the instruction of officers in wireless telegraphy, and probably, later, officers of the Postmaster-General's Department will be sent there for instruction. If this opportunity were allowed to pass, and an attempt were made to resume the discussion on the item dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie's</inline> salary, it might be ruled out of order as not closely relevant. It seems to me that the only opportunity for discussing it on the Postmaster-General's J Estimates would be on the first item, but that the discussion is perfectly relevant now. </para>

                            <para>-  I hold that this is a proper occasion for it. The point raised by the honorable member for Flinders is of great importance to our Defence Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie's</inline> connexion with wireless is only incidental, and the subject could be discussed without mentioning his name. What we wish to know is whether a system is being adopted which cannot be interfered with as infringing patent rights? We do not wish to adopt a system which will cause litigation, and perhaps make us hold our hands for six or seven years. We need wireless stations which will be able to communicate with the vessels of the Australian unit, and should not adopt a system which may be an infringement of patent rights. When we try to discuss this matter on items in the Estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department relating to the salary of the expert, or to a proposed expenditure on specific stations, we may be told that we cannot return to a question that relates to defence. </para>

                            <para>- I had almost concluded my argument when the point of order was raised. But, as often happens in such cases, the interlude has brought to my mind one or two points which I am afraid I must put before the Committee. The view that I expressed was that if the Postmaster-General adopts <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie's</inline> mysterious system, and that system is an infringement of, say, the Marconi system, the Department will not merely have to pay damages, but will probably be liable to an injunction. The Postmaster-General intimated by interjection that he was advised to the contrary.  1  think I understand upon what that advice rests. Section 92 of the Patents. Act provides that - </para>

This section is like a number of others, to be 'found, for instance, in various land compensation Acts, enabling the Government to take any private right of property for public purposes. It is always provided in such cases that certain formalities shall be observed before the property or thing is taken. But to say that the Postmaster-General without approaching the patentee to obtain an agreement with him, or without going to arbitration to settle the terms on which he may use his rights, can disregard him altogether  and infringe his patent- </para><interjection>

The Government may be secure, but on the statement made by the Postmaster-General I am not satisfied that they are. If they start by infringing patents, they may not get out of the difficulty by paying damages. They may be reduced to the ignominious position of having their works stopped, and of having to come down and meet the people whose patents they have infringed. </para>

                            <para>- I could understand the position of the Government if they were dealing with a secret patent, and not one like this, which the patentee is entitled to use, according to the Minister's statement, in every other part of the world. I could understand their being extremely reticent about allowing anything of the kind to get out, but I cannot understand their being reluctant to say, even in that case, " We have submitted the invention to certain experts, and have received a favorable report regarding it." Apparently they are not prepared even to go so far as that. </para>

                            <para>- There is, in the Patents Act, certain machinery by which, when a man wants to take out a patent, he puts in his application and then his specification is submitted to the examiners, whose duty it is, on his behalf, to examine the patent, compare it with all others, and see whether it is an infringement or whether it is new. I should have thought the simplest course for the Government to take in this matter, before committing themselves to nail their colours to the mast with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> would have been to say to that gentleman, " Submit 5'our invention to one of the examiners who is the skilled official appointed for that purpose under the Patent Laws. Let him examine it and report to us whether it is a new  invention or an infringement of old inventions before we take it up in any way." </para>

                            <para>- 1  remember many years ago in New South Wales that we wanted to get a new and improved telephone jack. The Siemens Company at the time gave us an improved jack, and I was recommended to purchase it from them. The Western Electric Company took us to Court, and the Judge stopped those jacks from being landed in Sydney at all. I advise the Minister to look up what Judge Owen said on that occasion. I am not so much concerned with the legalities of this case, or as to whether the Government can get through the law upon a technicality or not. My point is that it is wrong for a Government to take any risk with a matter that is the subject of a patent. The Government confer patent rights upon other people, and protect their rights for them, yet here is a Government who are going to chance this thing for themselves. That is a fine example to set to private individuals. Of course, the Minister need not pay any attention to what I am saying. He is a very lofty individual, but he will be very lucky if he is not brought to his marrow-bones before long. This is one of the most serious things that we have yet had to consider. A young man comes out from London with a system. Is it the same system that has already been ruled out in the Courts in London ? </para>

                            <para>- On the strength' of the statement made the other day, and quoted by the honorable member for Flinders from <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.,</inline> we and the public have a right to know, before the Government launch upon schemes of this kind, whether or not they are taking risks. The Government have no right to take risks with patent rights, above all other things. The Government are the one authority which is supposed to guard patent rights for everybody, and they should not set an example to those who are trying to take advantage of other people's brains. Either the Government have a right to use this system, or they have not. If the former, there is no harm in their telling the Committee, but there is only one way in which they can possess the unchallengeable right to use it. That is, by getting trie Registrar to say so. They are taking up an altogether improper attitude if they are risking it, saying, " We may have to defend our action."  I  understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> has been beaten in London in connexion with his wireless system; but  I  believe the Minister now tells me that  I  am wrong. </para>

                            <para>.- The item of £33,600 as. allowance to  224  Area Officers at  £150  per annum is one of most serious import to the future of the Defence Forces. The work originally contemplated is not being done at the present time. Some of these officers are struggling to do it to the best of their ability, but I believe that, in some cases, the practical training of the troops is being left to the sergeant-majors. I do not suggest that the Area Officers are not earning their money, but if they are only doing  £150  worth of work, the whole scheme is a burlesque and a farce. An Area Officer is supposed to live within his area, to know almost everybody, and to be the moving personality in making the training attractive and effective - to be the moving spirit in his section. No one can pretend that such work is being done at the present time for the paltry salary of  £150.  The compulsory training will be made or marred in the next five 3years, and during that period we ought to have the best ability that can be pressed into the service. As an expression of my opinion, I move - </para>

                        <para>. - If the honorable member for Parramatta knows of any officer who is not performing his duties, he ought to acquaint the Defence authorities with the name of that officer. If it can be shown that any officer is not carrying out the work for which he is paid, steps will be taken at the earliest possible moment to put matters right. It is scarcely fair on the part of the honorable member to make a general statement of the kind in regard to the Area Officers, who, I believe, are doing their best. </para>

                            <para>- They are permitted to follow their civil avocations, and the work, which is not excessive, is adequately paid for. Every effort is made to see that their duties are carried out in such a way as to fit the cadets for the Citizen Forces, and any complaint, so far as I am aware, is always closely investigated at once. It was impossible to make permanent appointments, for this would mean that ultimately, when highly-trained instructors were turned out of the College, there would be practically no work for them to do. At this transition stage the scheme ought not to be criticised as if it were in full working order ; and I ask the honorable member not to press his amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - The Honorary Minister, with his usual cleverness, has misrepresented everything I said. I made no charge against Area Officers of not doing the duty they were set to do ; my complaint is against the Department for giving them this work in such a way and under such circumstances. I am sure the Department has got the best men at the price ; but if the Honorary Minister means that the Department has obtained the best officers in the Force, he knows that is not correct, and he is disingenuous in so putting this matter before us. </para>

                            <para>- The Honorary Minister, without any qualification, said that the Department had obtained the best officers it could get, and that they had been recommended by officers high in the service. That is so, but before applications were called for the salary was fixed at £150, for which not more than three clays' work has to be given. If the work is not done the fault lies, not with the Area Officers, but with the Department, which is making shift with these men for four or five years in the inauguration of a new force. This is a total departure from Lord Kitchener's idea, which was that, in the transition period, the Area Officer should be paid an adequate sum, so that he might be relieved from following his civil occupation. He had to be a militia officer, of course, and the appointment was a temporary one, but the remuneration was to be enough to enable him to employ some one to do his private work. Instead of that, he is putting in not more than three days a week at the work of training, and is supposed to devote the rest of his time to his civil occupation. </para>

                            <para>- I say that he is asked to put in not more than three days a week. Will any one say that he is doing the work" effectively by putting in three clays a week? Six clays a week would be little enough time for the performance of the obligations laid on him. Lord Kitchener repeatedly emphasized the fact that this is the foundation of the whole system. The Department could, and should, have drawn the best men into the work; but, having fixed the salary of an Area Officer at £150a year, it is getting what it is paying for. Young lieutenants are doing this work ; but highly-trained men cannot undertake it because the pay is not high enough. We are getting, not the best ability, but the best ability obtainable at the price. </para>

                            <para>- That is an idle slander. Honorable members opposite  make political capital out of all these matters. They would not care what became of the Defence Force if they could make" political capital out of it. Our first essential is efficiency ; without it our expenditure is wasted. Although spending millions on defence, we intrust the efficiency of the system to militia officers at £150 a year, asking them to give two or three days a week to their work. In four or five years' time the result will be very serious, and our Army may be marred before those passing through the Military College will be ready to take up their positions. The defence scheme will not get a fair chance unless the Area Officers devote the whole of their time to their duties, and are paid adequately for doing so. I have no complaint against the present Area Officers; I say that the Department does not pay a sufficient salary, and does not require enough work to be done. For a man to devote only half his time to this important military duty is not fair to the Service or to the officer. </para>

                        <para>. - My opinion, as an amateur, is that the Area Officers are not fulfilling the purposes for which they were appointed, and not allowing our defence system a fair chance. They were wrongly chosen in the first instance. There were a large number of warrant and non-commissioned officers of experience and knowledge of discipline, tactics, and other matters, who would have been just the material for Area Officers, and the addition of £50 a year to their salaries, with an honorary rank, would have secured their services. I understand that the Minister recently had to issue an order to the present men, asking them to use their common-sense in regard to drills. Complaints were continually reaching honorable members through the press and other sources, about the way in which boys were being drilled for long periods without rest, and in all sorts nf weather, and the system was being brought into disrepute because the Area Officers were incapable of using discretion . </para>

                            <para>- The slavish following of regulations is the curse of every military system, and particularly of that of Great Britain, on which ours is founded. The experience and ability of our warrant and non-commissioned officers would have been of great service had they been appointed to act as Area Officers. Were a man of seven or ten years experience to be appointed an Area Officer, he would be on the same level as men possessing no experience at all. Not only is there need for reform in the Postal Department, but great mistakes have been made in the Defence Department, and changes are urgently needed. I hope that when new appointments are made, consideration will be given to those who have experience, and the knowledge necessary to enable them to properly train our future soldiers. </para>

                        <para>. -  I admit the strength of the objections of the  Deputy  Leader of the' Opposition. The training of our future soldiers should not be regarded as a side line by those who are responsible for it. To mv knowledge, a number of our best Area Officers contemplate retiring, because it is not worth their while to devote the whole of their time to their work. A man who cannot make more than £150 a year is not the sort of individual who is qualified to mould the material for our future Defence Forces. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has said that the Area Officers are occupied three nights a week in attending to the duties of their office; but I know that some of them have to work six nights a week. They have to travel long distances in many cases, and their treatment casts a serious reflection upon the Administration. We are undermining the very fabric that we boast of having built up, and we certainly shall not be giving Universal Service a. chance of becoming what if ought to be unless we attract to it the best men available. A number of non-commissioned officers who have had considerable experience - and some of whom have been in the Indian Service - would be delighted to join the Permanent Forces and to act as Area Officers if the salary attaching to the position were adequate. It would not pay them, however, to forsake the callings in which they are at present engaged in order to accept a position in the Department at £150 per annum. They are capable men, and have shown their ability by their success in the profession of arms ; but the Department does not make it worth their while to join our Permanent Forces, and so help Australia in this, the most vital of all undertakings. I hope the Government will regard this matter more seriously than they have done. I understand that the Minister of Defence contemplates waiting for the Military College to turn out officers to staff our area forces: but many years must necessarily elapse before College graduates will be available. I feel so strongly on this matter that I am quite prepared to vote for the proposed reduction. We are not doing a fair thing by the men, and, what is still more important, we are not doing what is right by Australia in failing to secure the very best material we can get for this work. </para>

                        <para>.Like the honorable member for Brisbane, I have to discuss the question from the point of view of a layman, and I certainly think that some serious blunders have been made in the selection of Area Officers. I cast no reflection on the capacity of those already appointed, but I know that quite a number of men attached to the Defence Forces in my electorate regard as a scandal the way in which boys are required to suit the convenience of the Area Officers in the matter of attending drills. We should appoint officers who can allot for training a time that will suit the convenience of the majority, and not men who can devote only a portion of their time to the work. In many instances school teachers have been appointed as Area Officers, and they have to arrange to drill the lads after school hours. In other cases boys have to travel long distances at night to attend drills in order simply to suit the convenience of the Area Officers. Whilst I do not propose to vote for a reduction of the Estimate, since I believe that the Government are amenable to reason and will try to meet this difficulty, I think the suggestion made by the honorable member for Parramatta, that we should have as Area Officers men who could devote the whole of their time to the training of the lads, is worthy of the consideration of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>. - Whilst the uniforms that are being supplied to the cadets may be suitable to the climate of the southern States, they are altogether unsuitable for that of the northern State. The material from which they are made is too heavy and too close in texture, having regard to the climatic conditions of Queensland, and the boys there are often to be seen sweltering in them. I take no exception to the style adopted, but I ask the Minister to consider the desirableness of obtaining a lighter material for the uniform to be worn in the northern State. </para>

Failing such action, additional training centres should be established. In Queensland, we have a number of small towns or villages within a  5-mile  radius, and one' training centre in respect of them means that the boys have either to travel by rail or walk a considerable distance to attend drill. </para>

As to the other point raised by the honorable member for Moreton, we have on the table a Bill which has already received the unanimous approval of the Senate, and in which the Minister takes power to allow boys to abstain from drill if they are situated a certain distance from where the parade is to take place.

Last year I complained that only £2 had been paid under that head. This year, I find that, although £200 was voted in the last Estimates, none of it was spent. I cannot believe that the Commonwealth Departments are so devoid of inventive genius that no claims are made for these gratuities. Either the claims do not reach the proper quarter, or they are turned down by some one who is interested. </para>

Do the Government propose to take any action in that direction? Even prior to the Commonwealth taking over the Post Offices, an attempt was made to have the block resumed for post-office purposes; but since then, the work has assumed such dimensions that every one knows the step will have to be taken. The telephonic, telegraphic, and postal business have become so large that it would be simply a waste of money to try to make the present Post Office building suitable. As the Commonwealth grows, the necessity for office sites will grow, especially in the large cities ; and Sydney will grow faster than any other part of Australia. A few days ago, the Government proposed to purchase in London a block for the High Commissioner's office. They now have a grand opportunity to resume this block in Sydney ; and- if they do so, they can expand the Post Office, without interfering with the frontages. A large block at the back of the Post Office can be resumed without much' expense, because there is a very poor building on a part of it, and another part is vacant. This would serve the Department for a number of years. We are going to have a Commonwealth Bank, and accommodation for it must be found near the commercial part of the city. This block will be very useful for the purpose, and it would pay the Government, as a speculation, to resume it. They can build a larger Post Office there, and still retain the frontages. If they do so, the rents accruing from it will more than pay interest on the capital expended, and probably pay something towards a sinking fund. This sort of thing has been done in London by the County Council, and by other municipal bodies in the large towns in Great Britain. We must have a little foresight in these matters. The members who compose the Federal Parliament are supposed to be statesmen, and as such they must look ahead. If the block is resumed it will not be necessary to start building at once. Only a portion of the additions need be erected and the old buildings could be let. Practically it will be necessary to only purchase the ground, for the buildings on it are in no way commensurate with the land value. This will be a good business investment in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole. I do not support this merely as a local proposal, because I should be quite willing to support a similar investment in any other city. The Postal Commission reported in favour of the purchase of this block, and the State Commission, prior to Federation, made a recommendation to the same effect, and since then greater necessity has been shown for the resumption. </para>

                        <para>. - These Chief Clerks will be under the Secretary, but they will not necessarily have charge respectively of the branches mentioned by the honorable member. My brief experiences in the Department has convinced me that the work now expected from the Secretary, especially that which involves personal preparation of recommendations before they are submitted to the Minister, is out of all proportion to the possibilities of one individual. It is proposed to delegate to these three Chief Clerks certain functions, not necessarily Telegraphic, Telephonic, Postal, or connected with any other branch, but functions which seem to fall into a regular routine. They will submit recommendations of primary importance to the Secretary, and will be given a certain discretion in matters of minor importance. The Secretary may, or may not, agree with the recommendations they submit to him. </para>

                            <para>- It is not intended at present that they shall submit recommendations direct to the Minister, but that they shall prepare recommendations for submission to the Secretary ; and if the Secretary deems them of such importance as to be beyond his decision, he will forward them to the Minister. The Chief Clerks are given,- as I say, certain discretionary power to deal with matters not particularly important. In my judgment it is absolutely necessary to have some method of distributing the responsibility in this Department, and it is thought that the one proposed is the best to meet the situation. </para>

                            <para>- I am talking about business which comes to the head office through the Deputies, and which, I understand, will now go to the three Chief Clerks in the first instance. To have really effective administration, these three Chief Clerks should be the three best men in the States, so that they may have a proper status, and that discipline may be maintained. It is this reviewing of work by younger and lower-paid men which takes the heart out of the senior officers, and the Minister should take care not to re peat the mistake which has already cost thf Department dear. Ten years ago, when the Post Office was taken over and the new system inaugurated, we had men at low salaries reviewing the work of Deputies, and that alone led to the retirement from the service of some of the strongest and ablest men. The chief cause of trouble in the Department is the lack of tone. The Minister is doing the right thing in the wrong way. He will not get proper discipline by having the work of seniors reviewed by juniors. </para>

                        <para>. - To my mind, it is undesirable that the work of highly-paid officers should be reviewed by juniors getting much lower salaries. In New South Wales there are inspectors whose duty it is to report upon the work of postmasters getting higher salaries than they receive. This is undesirable, because it tends to cause friction. </para>

                        <para>. - I have a few words to say about the innovation of the Government regarding wireless telegraphy, which the Postmaster-General cannot assure us is free from the risks of legal proceedings for the infringement of patent rights. Having taken considerable interest in wireless telegraphy, I wish to condemn what has been done, though I am sorry to have to do this at so late an hour. There has been a good deal of doubt regarding our position in respect to wireless patents, and for some years the Government hesitated about bringing Australia into line with other countries in the provision of wireless communication, because of doubts as to the legal position. I understand that the Telefunken company was prepared to provide an installation, and to erect stations, indemnifying the Government to the amount of £20,000 against any successful action for the infringement of patents. The Government, fearing that it might become involved1 in litigation, declined the offer, though 1 urged its acceptance. I understand, too, that the same company would have sold its rights to the Government for a sum not greatly in excess of the indemnity guaranteed. The guarantee, of course, was to hold good only in connexion with successful actions. It could not be expected that the company would guarantee the Government against trivial or unsuccessful actions. All it meant was that the company would stand by its patents, and that if they were defeated they would pay the Government up to £20,000 for the loss sustained. Everything hung fire until the present Postmaster-General stated the other day that, on the advice of an expert recently brought from England, he was adopting a new system, which would be registered ; and, although he could not guarantee that it would not be attacked, he said that he was willing to take the risk. The new system flouts both the Marconi company and the Telefunken company - strong companies with an influential backing. In Australia, the men who have interested themselves in wireless are such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Hordern, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLeod,</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison.</inline> These big companies, now that, the Government has declined to use their patents, - will not calmly allow themselves to be flouted. It is most unbusiness-like for the Postmaster-General to run the risk of legal proceedings for the . infringement of patent rights.- - Any case that may be brought is likely to l&gt;e a long one, and to be very costly. The Australian rights of the two leading companies could have been bought for from £40.000 to £00,000, an amount which could soon be swallowed up in the legal expenses of a big case. A National Government should hesitate before refusing to recognise master patents considered by the leading counsel of the world to cover all other like patents. Some time ago, the Postal Department told me that, in its opinion, the Telefunken patents were covered by the Marconi patents. </para>

This expert was the adviser of the Radio Telegraphic Company, which had to pay heavily for an infringement of patent rights. </para>

                            <para>- What I have just stated cannot be denied. This officer's opinion should not be accepted in regard to a decision which may bring upon the Government heavy financial loss. More publicity should have been given to the matter. It does not matter to me what system of wireless is adopted, so long as it is up-to-date. I know the Telefunken people, and am better acquainted with their system than with others. The Government would not accept their system, because they said that the master patents of the Marconi company covered it. Now, however, they are taking the risk of offending both companies. Nothing should be done without careful consideration, and having the whole matter threshed out in Parliament. </para>

If the Governments of Great Britain, the United States of America, Germany, France, and, indeed, every European nation are in possession of a wireless system, and are using it, so far as we know, without question, why can we not secure the right to use some recognised system? The position with us is that we entered into a contract with a company to erect certain wireless stations, and that just as one of those stations was about to be used the Minister turned down the Telefunken system and entered into an undertaking- </para>

                            <para>- No one will deny that, although the original agreement with the holders of the Telefunken rights for Australia was entered into by the honorable member for Bendigo when Postmaster-General, the whole terms of the agreement were altered during the term of office of the ex- Postmaster-General, and that he could then have abandoned the system. Instead of doing so he entered into a fresh agreement with them which is open to serious question. We are now entering into a contract with an expert for a new system, and it is hardly to be supposed that that system does not infringe existing patent rights. Whether it does, or does not, we may be sure that it will be challenged. </para>

                            <para>- In adopting the new system the Minister is exposing himself to two fires instead of one, and is entering upon a dangerous course. In respect of the Telefunken system the Government had a. guarantee against action and loss for a considerable sum, and would have been much better advised had they stuck to it. Another aspect of the case is that, on the strength of the Government contract - on the understanding that the Commonwealth intended to adopt the Telefunken system throughout Australia- a company was floated to take over that system. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know a shareholder in the company referred to, but I protest against the Commonwealth adopting a new system of which they know absolutely nothing beyond what the Government have been told by their expert. As the honorable member for Macquarie has pointed out, that gentleman has already been implicated in litigation in the Old Country owing to his infringement of patent rights - an infringement which led the company with which he was connected into a great deal of litigation and loss. We are probably in a fair way to reap the same results, and there is nothing from a business stand-point to commend this action on the part of the Minister. I wish now to draw attention to the payments made to those in charge of allowance post-offices. The men are paid according to a schedule of rates which, to my mind, is not sufficiently liberal. The Postmaster- General recently decided to abandon the semi-official post-offices, and to appoint an officer at a salary of £110 per annum to take charge of every office having a revenue of over £200 per annum. This means that a man in charge of an allowance post-office with a revenue of £190 per annum, will receive £40 or <inline font-style="italic">j£6o</inline> a year less than will an officer in charge of an office earning <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> more per annum. That is not fair, and the schedule of payments should be reviewed and considerably liberalized. We cannot expect large payments in respect of small offices in outlying districts, and as a general rule those in charge of them do not ask for anything of the kind. But there are many offices where the work is so considerable as to take up practically the whole of the time of one individual, and where those in charge are not sufficiently remunerated. I hope that the Postmaster-General will take an early opportunity of looking into . the schedule. </para>

                        <para>. - All sorts of statements are being made by Ministers and others as to what is behind our criticism of the proposals of the Government in regard to wireless telegraphy. I desire only to say that, if there is anything behind it, I do not know what it is. I only know that my sole desire is to keep the Minister out of trouble, and there is nothing in respect of which he may more easily fall into trouble unless he is careful, than this very matter. The Minister has told us that the system he is adopting is not that which has been defeated in the Law Courts in London. With that statement I am satisfied so far; but is this system that we are adopting entirely the product of the Minister's expert? Is it his own? </para>

                        <para>. - I was rather surprised to hear the Prime Minister's statement that the Government are more certain of what they are doing now than they would be if they purchased a system that has been accepted by many other Governments after the fullest investigation and inquiry. All this trouble has arisen over a wrong step taken in the past.. I have never learned exactly how the preceding Government adopted the suggestion, that the Telefunken company should erect two wireless stations. </para>

Honorable members seem to think that when those two stations were erected, and the contract price had been paid, the  bargain was closed; but we have yet to learn what proportion of the revenue of the stations was to be taken by the Telefunken -company. We are in the dark on this -question. It may not be advisable to throw any more light on it. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government have not submitted the question to the proper authorities, upon whom are they relying? Is it solely on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie?</inline> That officer has only been here a short time, and "his antecedents do not appear to indicate that he won success for those with whom he was previously associated.  His  credentials do not appear to be altogether of the highest type. He may not be introducing the same radio-telegraphic system that was disallowed in the Old Country. He may be learning by experience, and putting forward an idea by which he thinks he can side-track the other systems. My own opinion is that eventually the Marconi system will be held to be the basis of the whole wireless principle. The Marconi company withdrew their action against the Telefunken company only to initiate a more effective action, taking <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Oliver</inline> Lodge's patent as the basis. If they can -establish their right to use that patent, then on the previous judgment 'of the Court they must eventually come out as the real possessors of the wireless system. If that is -so, whatever system we adopt will trench upon their rights, and then we shall be in a most unsatisfactory position. It is a great thing for the Minister to say that he is prepared to take all the risk on behalf of the Commonwealth. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> feels safer with the knowledge that he has the Government behind him than he did when he had only a company behind him. It is not a very good idea to put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> forward to register the system on behalf of the Commonwealth, and then give him the sole right to patent it anywhere else. The Commonwealth takes the responsibility of proving whether he is right or wrong, and he takes all the benefits that he may obtain from the rest of the world. The question is not so much whether- we are secure, as whether the bargain made with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> is a good one. If his patent is successful, and turns out to be better than existing systems, it is going to be a very big thing for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> but not for the Commonwealth. </para>

There are in the service, men who, years ago, committed offences which were not serious, but for which a black mark was put against them. Some of them have since served twenty years with a clean record. The Postmaster-General might consider whether those offences should not be overlooked, and the men given the right to have the furlough to which other men are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- The matter to which I refer is, I submit, not dealt with in the Bill ; and I should like some expression of opinion from the Postmaster-General before the session is over. The recommendation of .the Postal Commission in this regard has been approved by the Public Service Commissioner as equitable, and, that being so, we may reasonably expect the Government to take some action. Can the Postmaster-General tell me whether the fourth, class officers under the schedule now adopted, will receive their increments annually, as a matter of course? The men have a right to know under what conditions they are being employed, and whether the increments are to be annual, biennial, or triennial. The Postmaster-General, I understand, is against payment for overtime. This has been a sore point for years with the officers of the Department. Every Arbitration Court and Wages Board have recognised the principle of payment for overtime, and, as the Government have seen fit to place the Public Service under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, we may take it for granted that they agree with the principle. That being so, they ought to follow the many precedents set, and see that payment for extra work is allowed. At present, men who work overtime are allowed time off in return, but that is a rotten system in any employment. It gives the employe" no respite from his labour, and when he is given leave, it may, perhaps, be at a time when he can make no use of it. Further, overtime is not allowed, so to speak, by the day, but the hours worked during the week are aggregated. The result is that if a man works fourteen hours one day and two hours the next, that is reckoned as sixteen hours' work, and so on throughout the week. The proper rule to be observed is that, if a man works beyond the ordinary hours in any one day he should be paid at overtime rates; and I invite the Postmaster-General to inform us as to what is intended to be done in this respect. It will be of no use to offer the excuse that employes malinger or anything of that sort, for even if that be so, the management is deficient, in that proper supervisors are not engaged to see that the Government get full value for the wages paid. Then I should like to know what are to be the duties of the extra officers who have been appointed to the Postal Department? </para>

But whether successful or not, the effect of the action of the Government will be to drive the Marconi company and the Telefunken company into each other's arms, and cause them to make common cause at law against the Commonwealth, which will be involved in considerable loss, whether it be right or wrong. I think the Government are ill-advised in the course they are taking. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to call attention to a departmental regulation which is about the most woodenheaded I ever knew of. It has been in operation for some time now ; but it ought to be altered at the earliest possible moment. I refer to the regulation under which a double test is applied to the question whether or not a district shall be entitled to a delivery of letters. Before  there can be a postal delivery, there must be 100 letters daily for distribution, and the income of the local office must not be less than ,£200 a year. In reality, the number of letters which go through an office ought to be the one and only test. In my own electorate, not far from where I- live, there is an office at which 120 letters are received daily for distribution ; but that office does not earn the required revenue, for the simple reason that many of the residents are in business in the city, and buy their stamps and do other postal business there. In the case of another office, although the number of letters received for distribution may be less than at the office I have just mentioned, more money is earned owing to local circumstances, and, therefore, the privilege of a delivery is granted. If the money for stamps is not being paid over the counter of the local office, it is being paid over some other counter. </para>

If the test were applied throughout, the Department would, in many instances, find itself in a ridiculous position. Some of the most important offices do not earn sufficient money to entitle them to the privilege of a delivery; for instance, there are junction and quadruplex offices which do not earn enough to pay the salaries of the men in charge, and yet it is necessary that they should be there. I hope the Minister will look into this matter. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to the inspectors, I have before urged that there is a strange want of tone in the office from top to bottom1, and that this has <inline font-style="italic">led</inline> to a great deal of trouble for some time You cannot keep these big business concerns strung up too highly ; the moment they get slack, troubles begin. The way to preserve discipline, and to keep a proper tone, is to be careful about the placing of officers in authority. I have referred to the supervision of the recommendations of £800 a year men by £500 a year men, and I would also draw attention to the fact that some of the inspectors responsible for the organization of the offices of a district are paid less than some of the postmasters in that district, the commencing salary of an inspector being a little over £300 a year, while some of the postmasters may get £100 or £150 a year more. The status of the inspectors should be raised. An inspector has not much encouragement for doing his best to keep a district in a state of efficiency when he knows that the postmaster who in some cases is doing only routine duty is receiving more salary. </para>

Ministers hope that such actions will not be brought. If it be found that we are infringing the rights of any system, we shall be ready to pay. I have carefully avoided any discrimination between the two big competing companies, and shall continue to preserve a neutral attitude. Each has notified me of its intention to take action against the other, and of its expectation of a successful issue. </para>

Realizing that the establishment of wireless stations is a necessity, we have adopted a particular system, and if it be found that we are infringing patent rights, we shall meet our liabilities as a Government should do. I hope that next session our stations will be fully equipped, and able to transmit round the coast- any opinions in regard to them or the system employed that honorable members may wish to express. Referring to what has been said about the position of the Chief Clerks, I would explain that it will be their business to deal with the innumerable reports and communications from inspectors and deputies sent on to the Central Office for decision, and with the enormous correspondence of the Central Office. All inquiries, reports, and correspondence will be sorted under their control, and, if possible, dealt with, either directly or by reference to the Secretary, or in important cases by submission to the Minister. </para>

It is believed that the new system will save a great deal of trouble, and will expedite the answering of correspondence. Having looked into the arrangement very carefully.

A Bill has been drafted which will meet the honorable member's view in regard to furlough. It provides that when an officer has been in the Public Service for at least. twenty years he may be granted, on the recommendation of the Commissioner, leave of absence for a period not exceeding twelve months on half pay, or six months on full pay. The Commissioner will thus have a discretionary power which he does not possess at present. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to increments, fifth class officers get them automatically, but with fourth class officers their payment depends on good conduct, though officers giving anything like reasonable service seldom fail to get them. For overtime the Department gives time off in lieu, money payments having been found unsatisfactory.I am aware that the Arbitration Courts of at least two of the States have in particular cases awarded special rates for overtime, but we think it better to compensate for it by time off, and the greatest consideration is shown for the officers' convenience in allotting it. </para>

                            <para>- The object of this motion is to provide a Treasurer's advance for the first month of the next financial year. Although the intention of the Government is to call Parliament together before the end of the current financial year - and it will be convened bar accident before that time- I think it is convenient that a Treasurer's advance should be supplied for the first month of the next financial year. </para>

                            <para>- Because honorable members do not take any interest in them. We have been voting millions tonight while they have been asleep. There has been no criticism, no trouble about anything except to let items go through. It is time that the country began to open its eyes and see what is really going on here. Here we are asked, to cap it all, to vote money for 1913, I can do nothing but protest now. Our duty outside, of course, will be to point out what has gone on inside. I protest against a proposal of this kind being put through at 20 minutes to  s  o'clock in the morning, after we have been sitting since half-past 10 o'clock on the previous morning. This is legislation by the sheer weight of numbers - by exhaustion. It is a legislative orgy. There is not an honorable member who will pretend that he has a grip of the business which is going through. I know that I have not. The sooner the country realizes that the Caucus has destroyed this Parliament for the time being, the better it will be. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the Committee is entitled to know why this money is wanted. Some remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta were justified, but nine-tenths of them were not.  His  remarks about the Caucus were absolutely unjustified. I think that if a little more explanation of proposals were given, there would be less dissatisfaction from both sides of the Chamber. I am not very experienced in parliamentary or financial matters, but I do think that when a month's supply for 1913 is asked for, at least five minutes' explanation of the reason for the proposal should be given to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - Ever since this Parliament commenced- it has been a subject of complaint that its financial arrangements were defective, to this extent, that, do as we would, the votes for public works lapsed on 30th June, and all accounts had to be closed on that date, unless, of course, some provision had been made to provide supply for the new financial year, lt has been suggested that the Audit Act should be amended so as to allow the Treasurer to finance public works for the first month of the new financial year, and thus prevent embarrassment. This suggestion has not been adopted ; but this difficulty has been recognised by all parties in power. The only way is to appropriate, in the current financial year, a sum to cover the first month of the next. financial year, in order to prevent a jarring stoppage. I have stated that, in all probability, Parliament will be called together before the end of the present financial year ; but, even then, it would be most difficult to get Supply in time. No danger to the public convenience, or to the good government of the Commonwealth, can arise out of what I propose. It is not a case of appropriating money for new works, but a case of placing in the hands of the Treasurer a sum out of which he can make advances from time to time for works in progress. If I thought for a moment that my proposal was open to serious objection, or violated! the sound principle of a full control of the finances, whatever the disabilities might be, I should not ask the Committee to approve of it ; but I am sure that honorable members who have given any thought to the matter, will admit that this is not only a sensible, but a necessary, provision to make. </para>

                            <para>- No; July next. The honorable member has stated that the object of this proposal is to appropriate Supply for a month's services in the next financial year. It is nothing of the kind. Until a Supply Bill is passed after the close of the financial year there can be no Treasurer's Advance for the first month of the new year. This is only to cover the Treasurer's Advance, and is not an appropriation in respect of Supply for the first month of the next financial year. It is simply designed to enable public works to be carried on. The principle is a sound one. If I had any doubt as. to that I should not ask honorable members to agree to the course that I have invited them to take. If honorable members on either side are in any way apprehensive I would much rather drop the motion altogether, although by so doing we shall inconvenience the Service. </para>

We then passed a Bill covering two months' Supply, whereas the Prime Minister himself says that this is not a demand for a month's Supply but only for an advance to the Treasurer. I cannot find a shred of excuse for voting now money that can well be voted later on within the financial year. . Unless the Government intend to refrain from meeting Parliament again until June or July, there can be no excuse for the course now proposed. If the Treasurer  wants an advance he will be able to obtain it on the first day that the House meets after the recess. </para>

                <para class="block">When the Treasurer delivered his Budget he announced that it was the intention of the Government to set aside a certain sum of money, namely, £600,000, for the use of the Postal Department to meet necessitous cases which might occur in the different States. He also intimated that before any portion of that money was disbursed, a schedule would be submitted to Parliament showing the headings under which it would be spent. It is in fulfilment of that promise that this Bill is now brought forward. In all the States a certain number of works have been embarked upon in anticipation of the Treasurer providing the necessary money to enable them to be carried out. The complaint upon all occasions has been that money has not been available until it has been voted by Parliament, and that consequently a number of public works, which have been approved, could not be undertaken. I have, with the consent of the Treasurer, issued instructions that as many of the authorized works as possible are to be proceeded with, and in this Bill it is proposed to vest the Postal Department with power to utilize any surplus which may accrue from one work to meet any deficiency which may occur in connexion with another. It is thus hoped that we shall be able to make a very considerable advance in our postal equipment within a couple of years. </para>

                        <para>- Not quite. I did not observe in the Estimates as many blanks as appear in this Bill. I take it to be a really consequential measure, and I merely wish to say that a couple of years ago the ex-Postmaster-General, with a great flourish of trumpets, and in a spasm of zeal, announced his intention to set this Department upon a business footing. Its various services were to be made to pay for themselves. That was his guiding principle. But at the end of two years of his reforming zeal, this great Department, which has enjoyed the blessings of his more businesslike control, will be only £2,000,000 to the bad. I know that that is not quite a fair way of putting the position, but if we add together the interest and all moneys which have been expended upon the Department since it was taken over by the Commonwealth, it stands in debit to-day to the tune of £5,500,000. Good old Socialism ! We ought to imitate it somewhere else. </para>

                    <para>. - Under this Bill it is intended to appropriate £600,000 during the current financial year for the construction of telegraph and telephone lines and for carrying out special works in connexion with the Postal Department. Of that sum £266,000 is to be expended in New South Wales. I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the fact that a considerable number of works in that State are hung up pending the passing of next year's Estimates, because the Department has neither the money nor the labour at its disposal to carry them out. The circumstances involve a considerable delay, not to mention the great inconvenience to which those persons whose interests are at stake are subjected. I do not know whether there is any possibility of expediting these works, but if there is, in the interests of the Department and the public, they should be expedited. There is another phase of this question which ought to be looked into. It is well known that during the first few years of Federation the Postal Department was starved. The expenditure upon it was insufficient to keep the lines and instruments in an up-to-date condition, and I am credibly informed that a considerable amount of the trouble which is experienced in the General Post Office, Sydney, to-day in connexion with overtime is due to the inefficient lines which have to be worked. It is not possible to get the messages over them in the way that it would be if they were in a proper state, and. these circumstances give rise to a suspicion that the officers are not adequately discharging their duties. It is all very well for the Postmaster-General to' come here and quote the number of hours which are being worked by certain officers and the low average message transmission, but he entirely overlooks the fact that they have to deal with very inefficient material. This is a phase of the question which should be investigated as early as possible, and a special appropriation should be made to bring the existing lines into a state of efficiency. </para>

                    <para>. - In connexion with the construction of telegraph and telephone lines, there is one matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General, namely, the frequency with which honorable members receive communications from the Department after telephone lines have been approved, stating that the works will be proceeded with at some future date - very often the following year. We are frequently informed that the contractors are behind with the supply of poles and cabinets. Is there not some means by which a supply of these necessary materials could be kept on hand ? Most commercial institutions would see that a sufficient stock was available to meet all reasonable requirements. The Railways Commissioners, when running their trains, take good care to keep stocks of coal on hand at convenient places. Similarly, municipalities do not wait foi road con tractors to supply material for every job just when it is required. They keep stocks on hand. Surely a big Department like the Postal Department ought to be able to devise some means by which it can get ahead of its supplies, and thus obviate the vexatious delays which occur in carrying out necessary works. Months after a particular work has been approved I have frequently received complaints from residents in various parts of my own State that no steps had been taken to carry it out. On asking the reason for the delay, I have been informed by the Department that the contractor is behindhand in the supply of telephone cabinets, and that the line can-&gt; not be carried any further because the contractor for the supply of the necessary poles is not able to provide them in time. This seems a peculiar method of conducting business. Contracts are let for supplying only, a small number of telephone cabinets. Why, can they not be let for 5,000 or 10,000 if necessary, seeing that the population is growing, and the demand for these conveniences is constantly increasing? However, we on this side have to recognise that' we are in a minority, and are simply tolerated, our representations being treated with indifference by' a Government who can rely upon a very comfortable majority. I hope the Postmaster-General will agree to postpone the consideration of this measure until we have had an opportunity to peruse the items. A number of honorable members on this side went home in the belief that nothing but the Estimates would be touched to-night. </para>

                        <para>- I am continually receiving letters to the effect that the Department recognise the justice of carrying out a certain service, but that it cannot be done this financial year, that there is no hope for it in the next financial year, and that probably it will be remembered in the financial year succeeding. I have even got as far as the year  1913-14  in the case of one application. </para>

Can the Postmaster-General indicate whether any of this money is being voted for the extension of works which are net going to pay? Will he tell us whether the existing works are paying, and how much they are paying, and, if they are losing, how much the loss is. Has the Minister with his new accountant arrived at any solution of the financial position of the telephonic and telegraphic services in one or all of the States? </para>

If amendments made by another place are not of a technical or difficult character they are commonly dealt with in the House; otherwise, they are considered in Committee. When this Bill was returned from the Senate, it was not considered that the amendments were of great importance, and their consideration was at once proceeded with in the House. Two have already been so dealt with. </para>

                    <para>.I wish to say that I agree with the amendment of the Senate. The clause makes provision that in the case of fraudulent withdrawals from the Commonwealth Savings Bank, the bank is not to be liable. I point out that if private banks make a mistake, arid hand out a depositor's money to the wrong person, they are liable. I think that a similar liability should attach to the Commonwealth Savings Bank as well as to the commercial side of the Commonwealth Bank. It should not be forgotten that in withdrawing money from the Savings Bank, the depositor will hand in his cheque with his pass-book. </para>

                        <para>- It might have been provided that where money was fraudulently withdrawn from a branch in which! it had not been deposited by the person in whose name it was withdrawn, the bank would not be liable, but clause  48  is a general provision, and would apply to the branch in which the money was deposited, and in which the specimen signature of the depositor is kept. I shall not take up time unnecessarily in discussing the matter now, but I agree with the amendment, and if a division is called for I shall make one to assist in striking out this clause. </para>

                <para class="block">If a private banking institution pays on a forgery, it is liable, no matter how good the forgery may be, and I may say that I have seen forged cheques which, since proof could not possibly be supplied at the time they were presented, could not be detected as forgeries. Yet the bank had to make the money good. My principal objection is that the clause places great temptation in the way of the officers of the bank. It places in their hands an instrument which, I venture to say, will some day be used, and that, in my opinion, is most unwise. </para>

                    <para>. - My experience is that people who deposit money in Savings Banks take the utmost care of their bank books, and in such case, there is no chance of any other person being able to operate on an account. It is frequently found that beggars, who are never suspected of having a banking account, have concealed about them Savings Bank books; and this only shows .the care with which such valuable documents are safeguarded. Much was said elsewhere about servant girls losing their bank books, but I may say that, as a plumber, I had much to do with private houses, and I found that the servant girls were very careful, indeed, to allow no one else to have the book but themselves. There was no dissentient voice raised in the House in regard to this clause; and, after all, to remove it is, in my opinion, simply to offer a temptation to fraud. Even a depositor might enter into an arrangement with an accomplice to draw his money, and to then sue the bank. When we protect the Savings Bank we are protecting the community generally ; and, under all the circumstances, I think we ought to reinstate the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not see why the Savings Bank should not take the responsibility. If a man's house were broken into, his bank, book stolen, and his deposit drawn on a forged signature, the bank would, under the clause, go scot free. My own idea is that a large banking institution should place a certain percentage aside for contingencies of the kind. People who intend to commit frauds of the kind will go about the business in no haphazard fashion, but will be prepared with signatures and other proofs necessary to satisfy the banks. As to the argument about reasonable care, I suppose that a depositor would be able to show that he was in no way to blame in this regard. </para>

                    <para>. -A curious fact about this clause is that it is operative only in regard to the Savings Bank branch, which is used principally by those who have the least experience of banking. This legislation would, therefore, appear to be against the interests of the most ignorant portion of the community, if I may so describe them. Amongst certain people it is the easiest thing to persuade them to give up their bank books, and many a time I have been made the custodian of such books for safe keeping, although I pointed out that this was against the intention of the Act of Parliament. My own mother, who had not sufficient experience to draw a cheque in the ordinary way, placed her money in the Savings Bank. I received a letter from the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Graham</inline> Berry, late Treasurer of Victoria, assuring me that there was no such account, but when I returned to England some years later, I found the book, and then it was possible to pay the deposit. Further, I have known of instances where depositors have suffered loss, simply through their bankbook being stolen, and other instances where wives have drawn husband's deposits and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> As I have said, this provision operates only in the case of the Savings Bank branch. </para>

That money cannot be withdrawn without the production of the deposit receipt. But even if the deposit receipt should be stolen or destroyed the bank is nevertheless answerable to pay the money. The average person who puts a few pounds in the Savings Bank_ cannot be expected to have as much banking knowledge as big financial magnates possess. </para>

                    <para>. - I doubt whether it is a wise thing to allow the Senate's amendment to be made. We certainly ought to guard the position in some way, otherwise there will be a danger of collusion taking place with the object of robbing the bank. It will be known that a depositor whose account has been improperly' drawn upon will be able to recover from1 the bank, and I am afraid the knowledge of that fact will be acted upon. By the elimination of the clause to which, the Senate takes exception the road is left open for that kind of thing to be done. On the other hand, I quite realize that poor people who have money in the Savings Bank ought not to be deprived of the opportunity of getting at their own. Is the Prime Minister satisfied to accept the amendment ? </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill has been carefully drafted. It has been under consideration by three different Treasurers of the Commonwealth. It is intended to provide the necessary machinery to enable Commonwealth inscribed stock to be issued at any time when it may be thought advisable and necessary. The Bill provides in Part 11. for the creation and issue of stock, and in Part in. for the inscription of stock for registries, and registrars for transfers and transmissions, for the granting of stock certificates, and so forth. Part iv. creates a stock redemption fund. Then there are penal provisions and the usual miscellaneous provisions necessary in a measure of this kind. In addition to providing general machinery for setting up Commonwealth stock, clause 5 involves the principle that I mentioned when we were dealing with the Loan Bill recently. The clause reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That lays down the principle that whenever a loan is raised by the Commonwealth J per cent, must be set aside every year towards the redemption fund. This provision operates whatever the rate of interest may be. Consequently, in sixty-six years' time, the principal of any loan to which this provision is applied, will be entirely wiped out. We consider that the provision made in this machinery Bill is ample for all purposes of the kind. We propose to make a slight amendment in clause 12. The clause reads - </para>

It has been carefully scrutinized by several Commonwealth Treasurers, and by the Attorney-General. In my opinion, it meets the case. It was originally prepared, as the Leader of the Opposition is aware, by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, when he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. It has since been revised at various times. I think it covers all the necessary ground. </para>

                        <para>.The Treasurer is perfectly correct in saying that there are few points which appear to call for attention in this Bill. This, I am sure, is a fact that will be welcomed by the House at this hour. But .there are one or two departures for which justification will, be required. The first is in clause 5, where it is provided that the maximum interest payable on stock shall be fixed at 4 per cent. I notice that in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner's proposal, the rate was 3 per cent. The maximum here fixed is 1 per cent, higher than it was then. I am aware that it is a maximum, and that it is open to the Government to fix any lower rate that they think fit in regard to any particular loan. But the question is whether it adds to the stability of our stock, or whether it evinces confidence on our part in the popularity of that stock, if we think it necessary to raise by 25 per cent, the rate of interest proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. Even now 4 per cent, is a high rate. Certainly it is a higher rate relatively than it was ten years ago when the first Commonwealth Treasurer brought forward his 3 per cent, proposal. I think that the chief stocks in the Mother Country have never gone above 3 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- It is not what they are worth that is material in this relation, but what the maximum interest is. The question for us is whether this provision is capable of being interpreted as indicating a want of confidence in the character of our securities; whether it does not appear as if we approached somewhat timorously the market on which we shall be putting our stock. Ought we not to be able to appeal in a more authoritative way on the best terms that any of the Dominions can secure ? </para>

                            <para>- I dare say, but we are dealing with the affairs of the Commonwealth. It is not so much the limitation of the interest to which I am looking forward. The provision in that respect could be amended at any time if necessity requires. I am thinking of our standard in the world's market. It appears to me that our position may be prejudicially affected by an apparent admission on our own part that we foresee the likelihood of our being obliged to offer  a  higher rate than the best fixed securities of the Mother Country obtain. This is one of the particulars in which the Treasurer departs from the Bill of ten years ago. It is a departure of doubtful wisdom. </para>

                            <para>- Too low an interest would defeat our object. The success of a flotation depends on many variable factors. I  am  not criticising this proposal in the light of a possible future position ; we have to ask ourselves how it will affect us in that future. Unless we are obliged to go above  3  per cent., why should we do so? We should assume that our securities will be considered to be as gilt-edged as any in the market, and that we shall be able to borrow at  3  per cent. </para>

                            <para>- In part. In regard to the sinking fund, as to the interest, I offer the same argument. We can well afford to provide that the payment to the sinking fund shall be 1 per cent., and even to pay 2 per cent. in the beginning. Should necessity force future Parliaments, the Act can be amended, but now at the outset the Treasurer can fix what terms he likes. I am having regard to the impression to be made on the public abroad as well as at home. We have nothing to lose, and not even temporary inconvenience to fear, by reducing the rate of interest to  3  per cent., and increasing the payment to the sinking fund to 1 per cent., if possible, making it 2 per cent. for the first few years. Such an action would be taken into serious account in the great financial market to which we shall have to appeal, where a first impression is very important. </para>

                            <para>- There is no intention to deceive. You would say, " We consider  3  per cent. a sufficient interest, that being the rate paid by the principal stocks of the Mother Country." Why should we anticipate our not being able to keep up in the race? It would be the easiest thing in the world to put aside 1 per cent., and while we should not bind ourselves to 2 per cent.., we could easily do that much at first. For the next ten or twenty years we should stand on velvet in the money market. I hope that within a comparatively short time the Treasurer will have to deal with the consolidation of the debts of the States, and what we are doing now must affect that very great undertaking, in which a slight difference in our standing on the market may cost Australia a very large sum of money. The Prime Minister takes too long a view. He is considering emergencies that may arise, but it is not our business to prophesy. Let us take a confident stand. There is nothing, even on the horizon, to throw a shadow of  suspicion on our credit, nor have we reason to assume that we shall take any but front rank. </para>

In these matters both parties have a common interest. The more I consider the matter, the more importance I attach to the terms and conditions on which we float our initiatory loan. What I suggest is not more than we are entitled to expect. Perhaps, after the second reading has been passed, we might have an adjournment of an hour or two to enable honorable members to think the matter over, because the making of a mistake in this direction we should always regret, and could not rectify. I desire that the great financiers and financial critics shall recognise the high standard of Commonwealth finance. It can do us no harm to take this position, and will do us a great deal of good if we firmly establish our credit. No one will thank us for not doing this, and if we fail to do this it may be at our own cost. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Ballarat that we cannot launch our first loan too carefully, because there is everything in creating a good impression at the beginning. When it was proposed to borrow to pay for the Naval Unit, we decided to strain every point to commence with a slightly better credit than the States, a matter of imperative necessity for the success of the consolidation of the, debts of the States. If we secured an advantage of only one-eighth, the work of conversion would come very easy. In my opinion, the Prime Minister would not do wrong in lowering the rate of interest. I think that  3  per cent. would be too low, but3½ per cent. would be the happy mean. </para>

                            <para>- If we have to pay a little more at that rate, we shall get it back in the long run. I have not much enthusiasm for sinking funds. Of what use is a big sinking fund to a country that is constantly borrowing? A sinking fund is all right if you are paying off a loan, and not raising another loan during that period. Otherwise all that a sinking fund does, it seems to me, is to help you to raise another loan. There is one reason for a sinking fund which seems to be a valid one. I think that it is a good healthy check on the Treasurer - letting him understand that the loan has to be paid back. It prevents reckless borrowing, I believe. But so far as the economic side of the question goes,. I confess that when we are constantly borrowing I cannot see that it matters very, much whether we have a sinking fund or not. Only from that point of view am? in favour of a sinking fund. </para>

The amount raised is to be placed to the credit of the Loan Fund, and will be applicable by virtue of Acts similar to that which I have just introduced.

                            <para>- That is the only State in the Commonwealth which has interminable stock. Possibly this provision was put in the Bill with the idea in view of the ultimate consolidation of the State debts and the taking over of that stock. But even in South Australia it can be paid off by giving due notice after a certain number of years - after thirty years, I think. In the true acceptation of the term, therefore, it is not interminable stock. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has a choice. It is not necessary to have this provision in the Bill for the consolidation of the loans with the particular class of stock which is held in South Australia. I think that it will place our loans' on a better basis not to have any suspicion when we are going on the London market with interminable stock at any time. 1, in common with many honorable members, look forward to the time when there will be only one stock in Australia, and we shall have come to a working understanding with the States, whereby the Commonwealth can control the borrowing functions of the States. Probably that time is not very far ahead. It is to our interest in starting our loan policy to see that everything we do will put our loans on the most favorable basis in the eyes of the financiers of the world, because it is by that means we shall get the best possible terms. The Treasurer has taken power to fix the rate of interest at as high as  4  per cent. Although it is impossible to forecast the state of the money market for many years ahead, I do hope that the credit of Australia will never be so bad that we shall have to offer  4  per cent. to get the amount that might be required for its development. Of late years, the money market has not been tight in the way in which it was a number of years ago. The tendency has been gradually for the money market to ease. There have been, no doubt, times of stringency, as there will be in the years to come. But, taking it all in all, I feel sure that if we are careful at the very start, we shall be able to get our money at less than  4  per cent. I would very much prefer to see the rate of interest fixed at3? per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I notice that under the clause the stock is to bear interest at a rate not exceeding  4  per cent. Suppose that a loan was raised for the purpose of carrying out some work which was not of a very permanent character. It would be possible to make the sinking fund in regard to that loan more stringent than the sinking fund in regard to a loan for carrying out large public buildings or a railway, providing, of course, that the maintenance was fully met in the meantime. Sixty-six years is, in these circumstances, a very fair thing for a sinking fund. I hope that when the Bill gets into Committee one or two of these matters will be attended to. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not want to argue this question. But if we can do better than borrow money at3½ per cent. we will do so. In view of the present state of the money market, if the Commonwealth stock is at par it will be the best stock in Australia by at least¼ per cent. An annual payment of¼ per cent. to a sinking fund will in the lifetime of some young Australians now living, wipe out the whole of the principal. I think, with all due respect to my honorable and learned friend, that3½ per cent. is a fair thing. </para>

What I expressed was my doubt as to whether, in view of the fact that the state of the money market is always beyond computation, even a few months ahead, it would not have been wise to make an endeavour to put our best foot forward first on a 3 per cent. basis. </para>

What does it matter whether you buy at £76 consols bearing interest at2½ per cent., or i'f you buy them at par bearing interest at the rate of3¼ per cent. ? What we need in Australia i's a stock in which people can invest their money, and then get out of it if so desired - after the lapse of a few months - a stock that is readily saleable on the market every day of the week. This provision will riot bind us to interminable stock. It is simply permissive, and surely in a matter of this kind we ought to provide the machinery for both purposes. </para>

I desire to place on record, however, the fact that I think it would be advisable to pay into the fund a higher rate in respect of stock covering works of short life, but in respect of permanent works, I think that ½ per cent. is a reasonable provision to make. </para>

I wonder what the Trades Hall will have to say to this proposal. </para>

                            <para>- But having regard to all the facts, the Treasurer is to be commended for the provision he has made for a redemption fund. At the first blush there was a temptation to adopt the suggestion of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Leader of the Opposition, and to provide for a payment of 1 per cent. into the redemption fund so as to enable us to redeem our stock within thirty-three years. We should certainly try to pay off our own debts within thirty-three years, and our inscribed stock would be more valuable if such a provision were made. Inscribed stock is almost a liquid asset, and a business man often finds it very handy to lodge against an overdraft. I hope that our inscribed stock will be readily taken up within Australia, for that will mean that we shall be paying to our own people the interest on our loans. Great Britain in the matter of loans does not feel the pinch as we do, because if the British Government borrow £100,000,000 the money is raised locally, and the interest paid to persons there, whereas when we float a big loan we have to send our money Home. </para>

                        <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>

                    <para>The Bill relates really to the Department of Home Affairs, but I am thoroughly familiar with its provisions, and shall briefly recapitulate them. Honorable members are agreed that there are three distinct features in respect of which the Public Service Act is embarrassing. It alters the date of issue of the annual list of officers from January to August and brings the Public Service year into consonance with the financial year, thus enabling statistical information to be prepared on the same basis as the Estimates. It is more convenient in every way, and will permit of printing being done at a less busy period. Clause 3 seeks to alter the scale of salaries of officers of the 4th and 5th class of the Clerical Division. All these alterations are being submitted upon the advice of the Public Service Commissioner. Under the original scale an officer had to serve eleven years to reach the maximum of £180 per annum. Under the new scale he will reach that maximum after eight years' service, and may advance by annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £200, if the value qf his work and efficiency justify it. At the present time these salaries are fixed by Statute. For some time past the Public Service Commissioner has recommended the granting of a slight increase to these officers. But I do not think it would be wise for me to pay the increases out of Treasurer's Advance. Then it is proposed to alter the scale of salaries for 4th class officers by increasing the minimum from £185 to £210, and the maximum from £285 to £300. Clause 3 also provides for increasing the salaries of 1 st class officers to £700 per annum in exceptional cases, on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. Clause 4 contains machinery to give effect to the scale which is set out in the schedule of the Bill. Its new features are that it provides for a report by the chief officer of a Department prior to the payment of an increment to any officer under him instead of providing for that report to be presented annually in March. This will save labour, and the report will be of greater value. The conditions as to three years' service, and the passing of an examination prior to the payment if the minimum wage, are eliminated, the only condition insisted upon being that of age. Clause 5 permits of the suspension of officers being discretionary. Hitherto a member of the Public Service who was accused of an offence, whether it was of a trifling character or of some magnitude, had to be suspended, and undoubtedly a sensitive man would feel that suspension very much. He would be injured by it both in the community and in the service. It is now proposed to remedy that defect. Under this Bill if the charge preferred against him be of a trifling character he will not be suspended, but will continue to discharge his ordinary duties until his case has been decided by a board of inquiry. Cases are frequent in which suspension causes considerable inconvenience owing to the loss of service of officers for lengthy periods pending the hearing of their cases by boards of inquiry. The expense incurred in providing relieving officers is also considerable.. Clause 6 eliminates a provision which is contained in section 72 of the principal Act to the effect that an officer shall not be entitled to receive any addition to his pay while on furlough- That provision was considered unfair, because one officer on furlough might suffer loss of his increment, and thus be prejudicially affected in status during the remainder of his career, while another officer might not suffer if he happened to be at the maximum of his grade. Provision is also made to pay six months' salary on the retirement of an officer in lieu of six months' leave, thus obviating the necessity, for acting appointments. At present an&gt; appointment cannot be made until the leave expires. The clause provides for the granting of six months' salary in one amount instead of its payment by fortnightly instalments. That is a perfectly proper thing., Provision is also made to grant six months' pay to dependents of officers who, at the time of death, were entitled to furlough. Let us suppose that an officer has continued in the Public Service for twenty years and is entitled to six months' furlough. Should he die, the Government consider that it would only be fair to pay to his dependents a sum equal to the salary which he would have received during his six months' furlough, or such portion of it as he had not received. Sub-clause 2 provides that combined service in the permanent Naval and Military Forces and the Public Service may be counted for furlough. Hitherto this has not been possible, and the proposed amendment will rectify this anomaly. If honorable members will turn to the schedule they will see that the rates in the 5th class have been slightly altered to make calculations of salaries simpler and to avoid broken&gt; amounts. </para>

                            <para>- The proposed new rates of salary are shown in the schedule to the Bill, the only alteration being in respect to officers of the fourth and fifth classes. As regards the latter class the scale of salaries agrees with that approved by the Government in connexion with the proposals submitted for the classification of telegraphists. Under the original scale, including long service increments, an officer reached a maximum of ,£180 after eleven years' service, while under the new provision he will reach that salary after eight years' service, and may advance by annual increments of <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> to a maximum of £,200 provided the value of the work and the efficiency of the officer justifies. The only alterations in the scale of salaries for the fourth class are made with a view to increasing the minimum rate from <inline font-style="italic">£*&amp;5</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£2IO&gt;</inline> and the maximum from £285 to <inline font-style="italic">£300.</inline> That is clear enough. Officers at present classified in the fourth class at ,£185 will advance to ,£200, the proposed maximum salary of the fifth class, as a matter of right, while a large proportion of them will be entitled on the value of their work to advance to the proposed minimum salary of the fourth class, <inline font-style="italic">£2x0.</inline> A proviso has, however, been inserted that no officer shall, because he is classified in a certain subdivision of. the fourth class, be entitled to the salary of a similar subdivision under the new schedule, as in some cases there would be no justification for immediate advancement to the salary of the corresponding subdivision as provided in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I would prefer not to do so, because the Public Service Commissioner has made these recommendations. Officers other than those in the clerical division may be paid increases by an act of the Governor-General in Council. But clerical officers cannot be paid them without an alteration of the law. The Commissioner says that they are entitled to some consideration as well as the officers in other grades of the service. These salaries are fixed by Statute, and can only be altered by Statute. As the Public Service Commissioner has recommended them, and as they have been approved by the Government, it is only fair that we should submit them to Parliament in order that the officers in question may be enabled to obtain their increments. </para>

                            <para>- It provides for a readjustment. I do not think that there is any contentious matter in the Bill at all. None of the points which are dealt with are controversial, the alterations have been approved by the Public Service Commissioner, and do not substantially increase the increments payable, which, are not proportionately higher than those which are given to other branches of the service. The amendment of the principal Act in the case of suspension is a necessary one, and where death occurs while an officer is on furlough, I think, that his dependents ought to be paid the amount which is due to him. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I understand that it will apply to all. branches of the Service. If, after twenty years' service, an officer is entitled to six months' furlough he will be paid his salary for that period in a lump instead of being paid fortnightly. Should he die before his furlough has expired his dependents will be entitled to the amount which is represented by the unexpired portion of it. </para>

Its effect will be to increase the minimum salary of officers of the Clerical Division, which was £40 a year, to <inline font-style="italic">j£6o.</inline> During the second year of his service the salary of a clerical officer under this Bill will be £72 as against £60 under the principal Act, and during the third year it will be £84, as against £80 under the principal Act. But in the fourth, year there will be a drop, in that the salary under this Bill will be £102 as against £110 under .the principal Act. In the fifth year the salary will remain unaltered, but in the sixth year there will be a drop to £138 under this Bill, as against ^140 under the principal Act, while in the seventh year the salary will be £156 under the Bill, as against £r6o under the principal Act. </para>

                            <para>- I am told that on the strict reading of the Bill his salary during the fourth year of his service will be £102. Under the scale which is set out in this schedule, an officer, after seven years' service, will be paid a salary of £160 per annum, and during that period will have received a total salary of £760, whereas under the scale provided in the principal Act he would be receiving a salary of £156 per annum, and would have received a total of £732. So that under this measure he will have a slightly smaller salary per annum, and will receive £14 less on the total. But the concession which he will get is that instead of stopping at £160 per annum he will have his salary increased automatically to £180 per annum, and perhaps to £200. So that while there will be reductions under the Bill, there will be two additions which will automatically increase the salaries of officers of the fifth class. The only other point worth making is that a clerical ' officer, under the present law, must be under twenty-one years of age, and have served three years in order to get the minimum salary. Under this Bill the condition that he must have served three years will be obliterated. </para>

                            <para>- The difficulty of dealing with the Public Service in the just way that I am sure all honorable members desire is once more impressed upon us by this Bill. It deals with the officers in very large classes, providing for those increases and alterations which, in the opinion of the Public Service Commissioner, will more adequately meet the mass obligations due to the Service. The difficulty is that in these matters one has to take the proposals in gross, and recognise that there can be no discrimination. The same provision operates at the same time in every class, on the swiftest and ablest member of the service as well as on the man at the tail of the hunt. We are face to face with the difficulty of striking an average, and doing a fair thing in a general way, while ignoring all special capacities, exceptional industry, and particular qualifications. Under  those conditions there must always be genuine grievances. Men who are conscious of the fact, and are warranted in the consciousness, that they are giving better service, find themselves still kept shoulder to shoulder with men who take little or no interest in their work, some of whom have objects elsewhere, and are merely using the Public Service for a time as a means of enabling them to equip themselves for other pursuits. That is the real inherent difficulty surrounding every proposition of this sort, against which there must be perpetual appeal, confronts us once more. Taking, as necessary, an undiscriminating general proposal in regard to our scheme of Public Service remuneration, subject to those limitations, this Bill appears to be a step in advance of the existing conditions. It offers extra advantages, adds to the increments for some years and considerably increases the payment made in the first year. If the measure is criticised it will not be so much for what it includes as for what it omits, opening up the boundless number of questions which arise in dealing with so large a service. </para>

The Minister hands me a statement showing that under the old arrangement an officer received from £40 to £50 in the first subdivision, and will now receive <inline font-style="italic">£60;</inline> that he received £72 in the next, and will now receive £80 ; that he received £84 in the third, and will now receive £100 ; £102 in the fourth, and will now receive £110; £120 in the fifth, and is now to receive £120; £138 in the sixth, and is now to receive £140. In the next year he obtains £168. </para>

                            <para>- I do not follow the Minister's figures. According to the schedule, and the figures supplied to me, the amount in the fifth subdivision remains at £120. In the sixth subdivision an officer will receive £138 instead of £140, or a reduction of £2. In the seventh subdivision he will receive £156 instead of £160. In the eighth subdivision he will receive £168 instead of £170. The difference is that at present an officer gets the £168 and the £180 only by special grants so to speak, whereas now he will get. the £168 and £180 respectively as a matter of course. </para>

                            <para>- We asked at the time whether the clause referred to the Defence Act or the Public Service Act, and no information was given. It is evident that this Bill was contemplated when that clause was framed, because it now makes a specific law with regard to the Clerical Division, taking them out of the hands of the Arbitration Court, except in the extraordinary circumstances which are provided for in the six sub-clauses of clause 15 of the Arbitration Bill. That clause hedges the Clerical Division around with certain provisions that do not apply to the General Division. </para>

                    <para>The Bill is very limited in its title. ' Its purpose is "to amend the Commonwealth Public Service Act  1902-1909  in relation to the permanent staff list, the classification of the Clerical Division, new appointments to that division, the suspension of officers, and the granting of furlough." The large number of grievances, particularly in the General Division, cannot be legislated for in this Bill so far as they are outside this order of leave. I should be very glad to move for a classification for the General Division, but the order of leave makes it impossible to do so in this Bill. Consequently it must be understood by those interested outside that we are prevented by the rules of the House from going outside the deliberate order of leave with which the Government have introduced the measure. </para>
                    <para>It does deal, however, with the suspension of officers, and that opens up the whole question of the treatment of officers of the Professional, Clerical, and General Divisions in regard to punishments. Therefore, as I have been requested for some time past by persons interested in my electorate to move for a more equitable' means of investigating the grievances of officers who are punished, I should be failing in my duty to them if I did not make some effort in that direction. The Bill proposes to amend section  46  of the Act, which deals with the question of suspension and the methods .of investigating charges. I have circulated amendments comprising other alterations of the same section. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out that section  46  provides for a method of dealing with suspensions, and I am about to suggest another; and surely I have 'not transgressed so far. The existing Act provides, generally speaking, that an officer may be suspended or lie subject to a fine UP to  £10.'  In such cases there is no reference to the Board of Inquiry, but any heavier punishment may form the subject of an appeal. </para>

                    <para>The present board is one of the most lop-sided creations possible to conceive, constituted, as it is, of two officers of the Department and one representative of the men; and all it can do is to investigate and make a report. The railway men of New South Wales consider themselves badly off with the Board they have, but it represents a piece of progressive legislation compared with the tribunal under our Public Service Act. I desire to have the board altered so that it may consist of one representative of the Department, nominated by the chief officer in the State, one elected representative from each of the divisions, and an independent  chairman.  Boards so constituted are already in operation in connexion with the railway services of Western Australia and Queensland, and, in a modified form, to which there is considerable objection, in the railway service of New South Wales. I am not asking honorable members to launch" out on some untried experiment, but to adopt a method which has proved satisfactory under the State laws, and which railway servants are agitating for throughout Australia. The amendment I suggest will not involve any serious prolongation of the discussion. There is only one issue. raised, namely, the constitution of the board.' Methods of Hearing evidence, and so forth, are already provided for. Shortly, I propose to amend section  46,  insert a new section  46a,  and make consequential amendments in sections  48  and  49,  the latter placing the board in the same position in regard to certain subsidiary details as other boards of inquiry which might be constituted under section  47  . These amendments, if adopted, will constitute an act of long delayed justice to the public servants of the  Common wea1th . </para>

                        <para>. - This Bill has my hearty support. I am glad that the Public Service Commissioner, with the concurrence of the Government, has seen his way clear to submit a more liberal scale of remuneration, particularly for the officers of the fifth or lowest class in the Clerical Division. The Bill is the second, if not the third, instalment of improvements recommended by the Commissioner. It represents a step in the right direction, and I am sure Parliament will always be prepared to favorably consider any recommendations of the kind. I believe it has been the policy of the Commissioner, and it is his natural feeling and disposition to support any alteration of a liberal nature required by the altered conditions of the times. When the first Public Service Act was passed in  1901,  officers in the fifth class started at  ,£40  a year', and, in two or three years, advanced to <inline font-style="italic">£60,</inline> only attaining ;£i6o at the end of a long period. Three years ago the Commissioner recommended the increase of the maximum to  £,180,  and now we have the minimum raised from <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£60,</inline> and the maximum fixed at <inline font-style="italic">£200.</inline> Under the old scheme, as amended, it took a fifth class officer eleven years to rise to <inline font-style="italic">£180,</inline> whereas under the Bill he starts with <inline font-style="italic">£60,</inline> and in eight years he advances automatically to that maximum. In addition to the <inline font-style="italic">£180</inline> he is entitled, almost automatically, to two annual increments of <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> each. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible the Commissioner may think that there should be some certificate of efficiency justified by advancing years. At any rate, the Bill means that in ten years an officer may reach <inline font-style="italic">£200.</inline> These two changes alone indicate the readiness of the Commissioner to recommend ameliorations, and, in fact, substantial increases of salary; and the Bill ought to be accepted as an evidence of the good feeling, disposition, and efficiency of that gentleman in grappling with Public Service problems. In addition, the Bill contains improved regulations for the granting of furlough.  Under the original Act the right to furlough was, at best, very doubtful, and depended on doubtful and unascertained  conditions. The House may fairly be asked to welcome and pass this Bill without launching on any drastic amendments. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad to hear the explanation of the honorable member for Bendigo, but it appears to me that an officer is often kept hanging in the balance between the  ^180  and the  £200.  The increments largely depend on the reports of inspectors; and I am given to understand that some of our most promising young officers, sometimes for the most flimsy reasons, have their increments withheld. The two increments of <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> each are conditional on work value as determined by the heads of Departments and Public Service Inspectors, but I observe that there is no such condition in regard to the better-paid officers, whose increments are given practically without any interference from the Commissioner or Inspectors. In this way they reach maximums of <inline font-style="italic">£600, £500, £400,</inline> and  ^300  in comparatively few years. By the withholding of increments in the way I have indicated, some of our brightest officers are given no incentive to give of their best at a time when they may be of the greatest value to the Service. The fifth class maximum has always been obtainable by annual increments, and it is intended that the fourth class shall revert to the scale paid in Victoria prior to Federation, which, if acceded to, will place the fifth class in the same position as formerly - that is, its members will rise from <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£200</inline> per annum by annual increments - a very fair arrangement. </para>

                        <para>. - An experimental measure such as the Public Service Act must need amending from time to time, to remove the anomalies discovered in its administration. The Government has brought down a Bill providing for three important amendments. This does not do full justice to the Public Service, but at this hour of the session it is impossible to deal at length with the subject. One of the amendments gives legal sanction to certain increments recommended by the Public Service Commissioner, and approved by the Government in connexion with fifth class officers, and in a degree with fourth class officers, which will make it unnecessary for the Treasurer to provide the money from his Advance Account. Another important amendment deals with the subject of furlough, and does justice to the relatives of officers who die while enjoying or entitled to leave of absence, a recommendation of the Postal Commission, and, I take it, of the Public Service Commissioner, too. The Bill also removes a great cause of irritation by providing for suspension for breaches of discipline, to the disorganization of the work of an office, and the inconvenience of the fellows of the officer suspended. In many cases a reprimand without suspension would be sufficient. A suspension is often a cruel blow to an officer, because, although subsequently removed, it leaves him open to the charge that his conduct was open to grave suspicion. Under the new arrangement, officers charged with minor offences will continue at work until the charge has been dealt with. One by one the recommendations of the Postal Commission are finding their way on to the statute-book. I should like an explanation of the fifth sub-section of proposed new section 21, which provides that an officer who has served at least a year in the ninth subdivision of the fifth class may be advanced by yearly increments of <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> to a salary of £200 per annum. The Public Service Commissioner provided for long service increments of <inline font-style="italic">...</inline> after each of two periods of five years following the attainment of the salary of £180, but the provision to which I draw attention makes the increment similar to the other increments, except that the increase is to depend on the efficiency of the officer and the value of his work. In my opinion, the increases in the fifth class should be automatic. It is only when you come to the Professional Division that you can differentiate in accordance with the value of a man's services and the brain work required for their performance. I fail to see why officers should not rise automatically to £200 as they rise to £180. The increase of salary from £180 to £200 should not be at the whim of the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- There is a certainty of these increments being received by officers until their salaries reach £180 per annum, but the advance from £160 to £180 a year really represents no increase whatever, having regard to the increased cost of living in the Commonwealth within the last nine years. It is just as well that that fact should be borne in mind ; otherwise it might be imagined that we were doing something to placate the Service, which, as the custodians of the public purse, we are not entitled to do. The raising of salaries from £180 to £200 will be a recognition of the superior services required of these men by reason of the intricate machinery of their Departments. </para>

                            <para>- It ought not to exist. The salaries of public servants in the lower divisions of the Public Service of France go on increasing until the maximum is reached. That is the rule in the industrial world, and in the Public Service of other countries; but we seem to be always ready in the case of the Commonwealth service to leave it to some individual to determine who shall and who shall not be advanced to the extent of a couple of £10 increments. Honorable members have been put to a good deal of trouble in dealing with the complaints of men that they have been unjustly treated in the selection of officers for increments, and these complaints arise from our action in leaving the decision of the matter to the Public Service Commissioner. No man called upon to deal with such a matter can hope always to give satisfaction, but when we make statutory provision for the granting of increments upon certain conditions that law must be complied  with. All these attempts to do justice to the Service and to secure value for our money are restricted by one of the weaknesses of our legislation, under which, no matter how inefficient a public servant may be, he cannot be removed from the Service unless he is absolutely incapable. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The Public Service Commissioner has said again and again that it is most difficult to prove incompetence. Although a man may be known to be incapable, unless he is bordering on idiocy, he cannot be removed from the Service. Under our proposal the men would know where they were, and those who had to judge would be qualified to do so. Men who are dissatisfied have hitherto had to run the gantlet of three tribunals, and by the passing of the Arbitration (Public Service) Bill we have just created a fourth. The more we try to patch up an imperfect piece of machinery the greater must be the danger of a. breakdown. The trouble of the present situation is that individual grievances cannot come before the Arbitration Court and cannot be dealt with by any other tribunal. Time will not permit of the discussion of this measure at length, but next session I shall certainly see whether we cannot remedy some of the defects of the Service with which this Bill does not cope. The Government during the recess will have ample opportunity to carefully read the recommendations of the Postal. Commission, and having done so, I think they will have no hesitation in taking steps to remove the sources of difficulty to which I have referred. In Committee I shall move to amend sub-clause  5  of clause  4  by inserting the word " shall " in place of the word " may," and I shall also move an additional sub-division in respect of the fifth class - to be known as sub-division 10 - under which officers will rise from a salary of £[180 to £200 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- Very well. 'I recognise that a Court is able to take into consideration and determine what should be the wages and conditions of employment of certain sections of the Service, but the trouble is that it cannot deal with individual grievances. I therefore rather favour the suggestion made by the honorable member for Cook, and which, indeed, I have had in mind for some time. There ought to be a Staff Committee to deal with the complaints of men who consider that their claims for promotion have been overlooked, or that the work which they are doing should be in a. higher grade. The Staff Committee could also deal with complaints of remissness. </para>

                            <para>- It would be a sort of appeal board within the division concerned. No matter what machinery we devise in this connexion we are bound to have some dissatisfaction in the Service, but, as a rule, public servants are fairly good judges of the competency of any one of their number, and know very well whether or not a man has a genuine grievance. I hope that Ave shall have inserted in the Bill some such provision as that to which I have referred, and which offers the only means of which I know to put a stop to the unrest in the Public Service. I heartily approve of the provision that is moved for an appeal to the Arbitration Court. The honorable member for Maribyrnong, with, whom I often discuss these matters, thinks that the head of a Department might recommend a man for a certain position only to have him stood down by the Public Service Commissioner. So far as that is concerned, I think it is just as well that we have a Public Service Commissioner, because, irrespective of a man's ability, cases of 'favoritism on the part of the head of a Department sometimes occur. The head of a Department, without desiring to show any favoritism, may sometimes fail to deal fairly with a man because there is something about him that he does not like. </para>

                            <para>- Every division, or something of that sort. I object to the system by which men are appointed to vacant positions before anything is known of it. During my five years in this House I have known six distinct cases where irretrievable wrong has been done to men who have been passed over in favour of juniors. Whoever is recommended by the Commissioner or the head of a Department for a vacancy should not be permanently appointed until any man who feels aggrieved has had the opportunity to appeal to the staff committee, or board, to prove his fitness for the position. I would make the amount which had to be lodged with an appeal £20, or even £50, to prevent frivolous appeals, but some method must be provided by which a man can show that an injustice has been done to him.  </para>

                            <para>- I would not make the appointment permanent. It would be better to lose a little time" than perpetuate the ill-feeling that exists under the present system. Every system has its disabilities, but no man ought to be robbed of a position that he is fitted to fill. The man who finds an officer junior to him in age, service, and ability placed above him cannot do his work with credit to himself or justice to his Department. I should be glad  it  the Treasurer could make the clause referring to the six months' furlough retrospective, at any rate to the beginning of the current financial year. It seems peculiar that just at this particular stage there should be a number of officers going out. There is something wrong in regard to the position of fourth class clerks. A number of them complain that while the minimum is £210, they are receiving only £200. </para>

                        <para>. - As one who has taken some interest in the clerical branch of the service, I should like an opportunity of expressing my views, although the lateness of the session prevents the subject receiving the attention that it deserves. The Bill removes some* glaring inequalities in the clerical branch, but unfortunately it does not cover the whole Service. After all, it is only a piecemeal amendment of the Act, which requires much wider and more drastic treatment. There are one or two things not provided for, which I should like the Government to consider, with a view to the introduction of amendments in Committee. There are in New South Wales at least forty officers who were taken over from the State service, and although classified in the General Division, were doing clerical work. They have been doing clerical work ever since, and some of them are experts. </para>

                    <para class="block">This amendment is not so effective as would have been the proposal the Committee have just negatived, but it will, at least, remedy some of the injustice underlying the clause. The object is to bring the salary up to  £200  by one yearly increment of  £20,  instead of two of  £10  each. If the increase has to be left to the Public Service Commissioner, it might as well be placed on the same basis as the other increments. I realize the difficulty there is when increments are left to the discretion of some official ; but there can be no danger in the amendment, because the increase in question must, in the opinion  of the Commissioner, be justified by the efficiency of the officer and the value of the work performed. When this increment is due, the officer is just in the zenith of his powers, physical and mental, with the full responsibilities of life, domestic and otherwise, on his shoulders, and, therefore, most likely to be giving his very best to the service of the Commonwealth. </para>

I was surprised when I heard of the introduction of the Bill, and the honorable member for Cook was at first of the opinion that it might prevent men from going to the Arbitration Court. Why should we deal with one class of the Public Service differently from others? Are they to secure an advantage through a catch vote in this Committee? We have provided the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and, in my opinion, the men of the fifth class, as well as all other men in the Service, should have to go to that Court. </para>

                        <para>.- In my opinion, we made a great mistake in sending our officers to the- Arbitration Court. Parliament should shoulder the responsibility pf fixing scales of wages and increments. Boys have to be possessed of a certain amount of education to pass the Public Service entrance examination, and must be kept at school until they are sixteen or seventeen. After they have entered the Service, it is a good many years before they attain a salary of £180 a year. I cannot see why, when, a man has been years in the Service, he should be forced to go to the Arbitration Court for the determination of his salary. Parliament should fix fair rates, and should see that those entitled to them receive them. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know what the Arbitration Court has to do with this provision. The question is, whether, after eight years of service, an officer shall be entitled to the increase of his salary from £180 to £200 <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> annum. I think that the provision spoils a very good Bill, and will cause a great deal of unrest in the Service - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. CATTS (Cook) [12.37].- In my opinion, the rates to be paid in the * General as well as in the Clerical Division  should be fixed by Statute, and Parliament should be responsible for them, without prejudice to the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court. In some cases the hearing of evidence will show that our public servants are not as hardly treated as they think that they are. Unfortunately, the appeal to the Arbitration Court is so limited and qualified as to be very much impaired in regard to its usefulness. I was under the impression that that remark applied only so far as the appeal from the Clerical Division is concerned, but from conversation with the secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, I understand that it applies also, in a slightly modified degree, to any award of the Arbitration Court iri regard to the General Division. I regret that the House had riot more time to consider the matter. My wish now is to make the rates of pay more liberal than those fixed by the Public Service Commissioner) and if I had an opportunity I would do something for the General Division. The order of leave, however, confines us to legislating, for the Clerical Division in regard to classification; I hope that an early opportunity will be given for dealing with the General Division. </para>

                        <para>.- The position of the Leader of the Opposition is remarkable. He suggests that we must carry the measure as it stands, or vote against it. In my opinion it is best to put things right when we have the opportunity. I have no wish to prolong discussion. It is for the Committee to deal with- my amendment. </para>

That is our position in regard to the Bill now. But if any question should be thoroughly discussed, it is one relating to rates of pay. </para>

                        <para>. - This was considered to be a good Bill as far as it went, and I think that it will certainly prove helpful. I therefore appeal to honorable members not to attempt to determine in connexion with it questions that will be discussed in a later measure; otherwise it will not be possible to place on the statute-book this session a rather good measure that must afford considerable relief. </para>

                        <para>.- The approach of Christmas seems to be having a wonderful effect on the Committee. I am anxious, if possible, to make the Bill do even-handed justice where, as it stands, it will not, in my opinion, have that effect, having regard to the practice adopted in connexion with the Public Services of other countries and in our own State experience. But, because I simply want to alter a word in a clause, I am told that I am imperilling .the passing of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- Section 46 of the original Act deals with offences. In sub-section  3  it is provided that if the officer is of opinion that the offence might be met by a fine not exceeding  £10  he may prevent the matter going to a board of inquiry. I want to amend that sub-section by leaving out the words " that an investigation thereof should be made by a board of inquiry." This would take away from the chief officer the right of denying an investigation in such cases. I also wish to leave out sub-section 4 of section 46 which gives the chief officer the right to refer a charge to a board of inquiry, and describes the constitution of the board. I desire our public servants to have a statutory right to have an impartial investigation in regard to charges and punishments. I shall afterwards move a new clause to constitute the appeal board in the way I have previously described. I wish to leave out of sub-section 5 of section 46 the words " if any charges are admitted or are found by the board of inquiry to be true " and insert in their stead " if the chief officer considers the alleged offence to be of so serious a nature that the offending officer should be more severely dealt with." I would also leave out subsection 6 of section 46, and insert in lieu thereof the words " any officer punished in accordance with the provisions of this section may appeal in the manner hereinafter provided." These alterations will bring the whole section into line, enabling appeals to be submitted to the appeal board which I propose shall be constituted according to the next clause. I move - </para>

It is practically what exists in the Railway Departments of Queensland and Western Australia, where it has worked equitably. It obtains also in a more modified form in the Railway Departments of the other States, and we may very properly include it for the benefit of our own public servants, because the existing provision is unsatisfactory, lop-sided and obsolete, and makes for injustice to the men. </para>

                        <para>.- This principle should be included in this or some other measure.  I  do not think the public servants should be expected to go to the Arbitration Court, which can deal only with hours and wages. The hours have been satisfactorily fixed by Parliament, and if we fix their wages on a proper scale, that ought also to be satisfactory. The public servants ought to be able to appeal from any decision of the Commissioner to this board, which would obviate the expense of going to the Court. It would be just as well for the honorable member to hold the clause over until next session in view of the promise of the Government, so long as it is understood that we shall have an opportunity to bring it forward then. </para>

At present a large number of cases can be dealt with by the Deputy Postmasters-General, from whom there is no appeal to the Public Service Commissioner, and complaints of injustice are made. Fines are inflicted, and when increments are due they are disallowed because of the fines ; and some very hard cases have come under my notice. The original intention of the Act was, I believe, that every public servant should have the right of appeal ; but the Crown Law authorities have so interpreted the Act as to divide these punishments into two sections ; one involving fines up to £10, in regard to which there is no appeal, and other more severe punishments, in regard to which there is an appeal. For the minor offences, as I say, fines are inflicted, and the men in consequence subsequently lose their right to increment and promotion. If the Government cannot see their way to accept the amendment I trust it will be taken into consideration when a larger and more comprehensive measure is before us. </para></speech>

                    <para>This is a simple amendment of the Australian Notes Act ; but, as it involves a principle, I think I ought to offer some explanation. The public are, I believe, under a grave misapprehension regarding the purport and intention of this measure. Nearly all the controversy in the press has been on the lines that it is proposed, under the present Bill, to hold only 25 per cent. in gold against the note issue. That is a correct statement in one sense, but it leaves a wrong impression on the mind of the reader. What is provided is that not less than 25 per cent. shall be held at all times by the Treasurer, and, therefore, his working margin must be between 25 per cent. and some larger percentage. The wording is such that 25 per cent. must always be held, and cannot be drawn from. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members should know, from what I have stated from time to time, that I believe that 25 per cent. is an absolutely safe margin for an Australian note issue. In Queensland the reserve has been nearly double that which' actual practice has required ; but I am not here to say that it ought to be brought below  25 per cent. I have never been favorable to an amount being fixed as in the original Act - that gold should be held for notes above £[7,000,000. The desire of the Associated Banks was that gold should be' held for each note above £7,000,000 if there were a larger issue than to that amount. At the present time the issue is practically £[10,000,000, and it has been stated by financial men and writers that there is an over-issue. </para>

                            <para>- For all practical purposes, we have half in gold. It has been stated by financial men that the banks are holding more notes than they require. I desire to say most respectfully to all concerned that it is not the desire of this Government or of this Parliament that any one should hold more notes than are required for legitimate circulation purposes; and the only way to discover what is necessary is to place the matter on a safe basis. Without arguing the question at length, I desire to say that, in my opinion, the margin for a currency issue of any kind, paper or otherwise, in Australia, is not to be compared with the margin necessary in Canada, which is so often quoted. Canada has a long winter and a long summer. Nearly half the wealth of the Dominion is produced in a few months at harvest time, and during that period there is, of course, an inflated currency as compared with the average. In Australia that is not so. Happily, production in all branches of industry is more equal throughout the year; and' I cannot conceive of any jarring circumstance arising. The principle I should like honorable members to consider is this : The margin of 25 per cent., which must not be encroached on; means that the minimum working amount is one-third, or 33J per cent. I am prepared to do two things in this Bill, one of which is to provide that this amendment shall not come into operation until 1st July of next year. A number.. of people are apprehensive as to what will take place during the early months of the new year - February, March, and April - when the money may be wanted more. I am prepared to go further as Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- I have again and again given this return, and had it printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> but I may repeat that the following are the figures: - New South Wales funded stock, £1,000,000; Victorian Government debentures, .£686, 000 ; Western Australian stock, £[650,000 ; and Tasmanian inscribed stock, £[200,000. Then there are fixed deposits with the State Government of New South Wales, £1,000,000; sundry banks in Sydney, £[381,500; sundry banks in Melbourne, £400,000 ; sundry banks in Brisbane, £[175,000; and sundry banks in Perth, £[150,000 ; a total of £[4,642,500. There are also other investments shown in the return, consisting of Victorian Government debentures, £294,000 ; Tasmanian inscribed stock, £[300,000'; and fixed deposit in the National Bank of Tasmania Limited, Launceston, £[25,000. These latter investments amount to £619,000, making a grand total of £[5, 261,500. I desire to make a further statement to honorable members. I shall undertake, as trustee on behalf of the Government, that until we have had twelve months' more experience, the amount held in reserve in the aggregate shall not be less than 40 per cent. I feel so confident that it is a wrong principle to have a fixed amount above which we must hold gold against the paper issue, that I think it better at the initiation to lay down a sound basis. In Queensland there has been a  Government note-issue for about eighteen years, representing £1 7si 4d. per head in the hands of the public. In Victoria it was only 13s. rod. per head, which shows the difference between the practice of a people trained to the use of paper currency and that of one not so trained. It is not to be understood, and I hope that honorable members will not encourage the view, that the measure has been brought in to enable the Commonwealth to get more money for public purposes. Its object is to lay down a sound principle. Should further experience show that a larger margin is necessary, no one will be more willing than I shall be to invite Parliament to create the necessary security. We should not, however, continue a mere tentative system. No person will be compelled to hold a Commonwealth note in place of gold ; people will have to come to us voluntarily for these notes, and will be able to get the gold when they please. The business of the Government is to obtain the largest investment of the gold, representing the notes taken out, in sound securities, so that the interest may accrue to the trust fund in the first place, and, ultimately, be applied to Commonwealth purposes. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B. Edwards gave the warmest support to this proposition, and was prepared to go further than I am prepared to go. He rendered admirable aid in forming this trust fund, so that the interest on the investments might revert to it. Journals that claim to have financial knowledge have stated that we expend the annual interest from these investments. But I gave instructions from the first that when the interest came in, it was to be re-invested. Some of it has been re-invested, and consequently compound interest is accumulating, and in four or five years' time, in addition to the 25 per cent, gold reserve, there will be £1,000,000 to the credit of the fund, which will be an additional security for the notes. I hope, therefore, that in the interests of the country and of truth, the statements which have been published will not be repeated. I shall so alter this proposal that it will not come into operation until the 1st July of next year, and in the meantime shall hold 40 per cent, in gold of the actual note issue. If that does not allay the anxiety of the timid and apprehensive, I do not know that anything will. </para>

                            <para>- The keeping of the gold would be of no benefit to those who held the notes, nor to the Government, nor to the people of Australia. The provision of an ample gold reserve for all requirements is the most sensible arrangement. Queensland is a considerable State, and its people are not unintelligent. It has carried on successfully for many years with the reserve to which I have referred, and the Commonwealth might well experiment with a larger reserve until it gets more experience. No protest has come from any of the banks or public bodies of that State, which shows that they believe that no danger exists, and that the Commonwealth will benefit by what is proposed. </para>

                        <para>.- The experience of Queensland is an open book to the financial institutions of Australia, and the fact that Queensland institutions have not seen fit to protest against this proposal, while perhaps worthy of casual notice, cannot be instanced to depreciate the general experience of Australia. The proposal goes to the root of the financial position, not merely of Queensland, but o£ the whole Commonwealth. The Prime Minister is entitled to make what he can of the fact that there has been no sort of failure in Queensland under this system, but any financial stress of that State is but a fraction of that of the Commonwealth, whose interests we are considering. The verbal promise of the Prime Minister to keep for the next twelve months a reserve in gold of 40 per cent, is, so far as the period goes, fairly satisfactory. </para>

I suggest that the period during which a gold reserve of 40 per cent, shall be held to meet all emergencies be extended to two or three years.

                    <para>My feeling in regard to the original measure was largely due to the statements of the Prime Minister when introducing it. He then pointed out that while, to use his own words, a reserve of  25  per cent. was "not in any sense absolutely necessary," yet, to make things doubly secure, he was willing to increase that margin. He went on to say that therefore he -  deemed it advisable to limit the issue of Australian notes, or rather to increase the protection to the note holder by compelling the Treasurer to hold gold against all issues in excess of £7,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister, by his own confession, is forsaking the absolutely safe course for one wnich he thinks nearly safe ; he passes from a state of things in which there was no danger of inflation to one in which there is confessedly that danger. This is only met by the guarantee he has given to the House this afternoon. The deduction from his own statement is that the arrangement which he suggests as temporary should certainly be permanent. Confessing that in these matters I am dependent on information supplied to me, and am not relying wholly on. my individual opinion, I have thought it well to fortify myself by considering, not only the reserves which have to be kept, but the reserves actually kept without compulsion for the most part by the foremost financial institutions of the world. These are standards by which Australians will be judged, and can be judged, I hope, without fear. I find, taking the returns for the last two years available, that in. the case of the Bank of England the actual percentage of reserve to liabilities was but a shade below  50  per cent., whilst in the second year it was all but  52  per cent. The-' reserve retained in the case of the Imperial Bank of Germany during the last year for which the figures are available amounted to more than  50  per cent., while that retained by the Swiss National Bank was also above  50  per cent. I look through the Indian currency returns, and find that they are but a little lower. In the daily management of these huge financial undertakings we find that the amounts thought necessary to be retained, whatever the compulsory reserves may be, approach  50  per cent. This surely establishes the standard that we ought to adopt. In New Zealand, for the time being, the gold reserve amounts to one-fourth up to an issue of  £3,000,000,  and above that amount a sovereign is retained for every note issued. That is the position in the Dominion, where finance has always been more enterprising than in Australia, The statement made by the Prime Minister has altered the whole situation in relation to this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. We are to have another eighteen months' experience of the working of this system before we are likely to be visited by circumstances that will put a strain on our reserves. In view of that fact, the present discussion is to be postponed, and I propose to refrain from making certain other observations that I had intended to offer. From my own point of view, I venture once more to urge that every step taken at the present is more important than a number of steps taker, when we shall be better known and understood. I advocated, and would still advocate, a 50 per cent, instead of a 40 per cent. gold backing being retained during the first years of this operation ; and I advocate extra caution, not merely for its own sake, but until the financiers of the Mother Country and our own great financial institutions, understand our system sufficiently to give them complete confidence in it, no matter how the financial clouds may lower on the other side of the world, or how war  or insurrection might threaten to plunge us into difficulty. If, for the first few years, we maintained an unreasonably high margin, we should be acting in the best interests of the community. We are now at a stage at which even a little panic might have serious effects. We have our financial reputation to establish. Once it is established, we can sit at our ease, as they sit at ease in England, notwithstanding operations that may be affected by the most distant crisis, and other circumstances that give one a feeling almost of vertigo, until one discovers how much of this is built on credit, and the reputation of the Mother Country for unimpeachable finance, as well as a capacity to face all situations. In a lesser degree, that should be one of our aims ; and if I, like others, am a timid and cautious counsellor at this stage, it is because I believe we have now an opportunity to win the confidence of the financial world, which is a great deal better than running even a very small chance of losing it by some unexpected hazard. </para>

I am prepared to accept without any extended debate the offer made by the Treasurer. I take it that as the result of that offer, as amended at the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition, he will hold against the whole current issue a gold reserve of 40 per cent, until the next Parliament meets. </para>

                            <para>- The scheme as amended will enable the Treasurer to get a little more money, but not much more. I shall confine my attention to one aspect of the question, which seems to me to be - if I may say so without disrespect - not sufficiently present to the mind of the Treasurer. I do not question the validity of any of these investments, nor for the present any future investments that might be made, but it does not seem to be sufficiently present always in the Treasurer's mind that it is not the security of the investments, but <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> absolute and paramount necessity of having, in certain circumstances, actual sovereigns that is all important. </para>

                            <para>- That being so, there is yet another consideration. The Treasurer's speech shows that he realizes fully that where you have a statutory margin  of  25 per cent, you must never get down to that margin, because what .would happen in cur case if we did is that some of our notes would become inconvertible. If Parliament happened to be sitting at the moment the mistake could be rectified by an urgent Bill being  brought  down to suspend or amend the Act for the time being, but, except where the aid of Parliament might be called in by the Treasurer, df we came 'down to our 25 per cent, reserve, we should "have to say to some holders, " We cannot give you gold." </para>

                            <para>- I am sure the right honorable member would not. I am prepared to trust the Prime Minister and to accept implicitly the assurance he has gwen us this afternoon. I wish to point out, however, that if we touched the 25 per cent, margin, and if under circumstances that may arise on any day a sudden demand for £1,000,000 were made we should be in a condition of the greatest financial jeopardy, since, at any moment, the note issue might become inconvertible. If it did, no parliamentary explanations and no assurances by the Treasurer would prevent disastrous results to the credit of Australia. That being the case, the 40 per cent, margin, substantial as it seems, is really only a 15 per cent, margin. Your danger  point is not when you have no gold, but when you have only  25  per cent, of gold, and have to refuse gold for your notes. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable member must take his mind back a little further. A .1:5 per cent, margin will probably give, on the present issue, really a  23  or  25  per cent, margin, as the withdrawals reduce the total. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it works out by a sort of geometrical progression, involving somewhat intricate calculations ; but I think the Treasurer admits the principle for which I am contending. We are perfectly safe in accepting the assurance given by him ; but the public, as well as. Parliament, ought to know that once you are within close touch of your statutory margin, whatever it is, you are in just as bad a position as if you had no gold at all, so far as the inconvertibility of your notes is concerned, and' so far as your foreign credit is concerned. It is true that you still have the gold, which Parliament may release, and to that extent you are better off. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. Another thing which has always filled  me  with a certain amount of apprehension in regard to note issues, and which has been the cause of the wrecking of many such craft in other countries, is this : When things are going extremely well, we are apt to look at ail these matters through rose-coloured spectacles. We are inclined to think now, for instance, that if the banks Or the public generally brought their notes in large quantities to the Treasury, the Treasury would have the necessary gold to meet them ; but it must not be forgotten that the very same circumstances which create the necessity among business men or banks to have sovereigns, instead of securities representing sovereigns, will at the same time militate against the Treasurer getting sovereigns when he wants them, however good his securities may be. We are, therefore, not in such an overwhelmingly safe position ;.is the 40 per cent, margin would at first seem to suggest; but I am delighted to have the Prime Minister's assurance. In eighteen months' time we shall have had some experience, and have obtained an expression of opinion from the electors throughout Australia, as I understand the Prime Minister's assurance holds until the next Parliament meets. I am quite prepared to accept it, because in matters of this sort we must always trust the Treasurer. Every Parliament must impose very great- trust in the Treasurer for the time being, and it is fortunate that we can say, as regards our communities, that the occasions on which that trust has been abused have been very rare. There is, of course, no reason to anticipate any other result on the present occasion ; and at the end of the eighteen months we shall be able to speak with more wisdom and experience about the matter than we can now. </para>

                            <para>- Really, however, that is the object of this Bill. The position at present is that the Treasurer must keep  25  per cent, of the issue up to  £7,000,000.  With the money between that sum and the  £7,000,000  he can do as he likes, either investing the money in securities, or advancing it for the purpose of public works ; but beyond the  £7,000,000  mark he must have gold against the issue. He now wants authority, not to advance the moneys over  £7,000,000  for loan works, but to invest it. </para>

Are we simply to rely on his promise to invest the moneys in the securities mentioned in the Act, or are we to allow him to remove the necessity for keeping coin against the issue over  £7,000,000,  and then leave him free to do as he likes with the money, either advancing it for public works, or investing it ? According to the Act as it. now stands, the Treasurer may invest any moneys over  25  per cent, and under the  £7,000,000  on deposit at any bank, or in securities of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth or of a State. As he simply wants power to make a profit on the moneys over  £7,000,000,  we ought to make the clause read in this way - </para>

                            <para>- I do not mind about 40 per cent. We shall have secured at least 35 per cent. The Treasurer is suspending the operation of this Bill until we have had the experience of perhaps the next eighteen months. So far, so good; but if we are altering the principle of the Act for the purpose of making money on our investments, we ought to compel the Treasurer to invest the excess over  £[7,  000, 000 according to the terms of section 8 of the Act. I hope that whatever Treasurer is in power then will not reduce the proportions in the Act. At present the Act is based on the Canadian system. In Canada the Government notes are practically gold certificates. The Government are obliged to hold a certain proportion in coin, and are allowed to issue uncovered by coin an amount up to about $30,000,000, but beyond that there must be gold held against the issue. We adopted that principle, so that, as a matter of fact, we have, as in Canada, the principle of gold certificates up to a certain amount, and the banks and the public accept our notes, as in Canada, with the assurance that they are convertible into coin and are as good as coin. So great is that, assurance in Canada that the banks use the Government gold certificates for all purposes of gold, and they are accepted as such. I am afraid that the absolute assurance of the public that the note issue will be practically as good as gold will be defeated to the extent to which we depart from that principle. Apart from the Dominion notes altogether, there is in Canada a system of note issue for general purposes against which 'there is practically no reserve at all. That is the bank note issue, and it is that which is called upon to meet the expansion or contraction of trade necessities at each season. These notes, since the Canadian banking system was reorganized in 1890, have been met with unfailing regularity. We must, therefore, not be deceived by the Canadian system. We in Australia will have no bank issue. The Government have taken it upon themselves to regulate the whole issue, and in doing that I hope they will stick to the Canadian principle, under which the notes issued by the Dominion Government are regarded as gold certificates, which can be converted into gold at any time with absolute certainty. </para>

                            <para>- We do not 'know yet whether that is so, with our limited experience, and we shall scarcely know, before next Parliament meets, how much should be held against our issue to meet the demands of trade and commerce. The Queensland experience up to the present is practically no guide to us. Certainly, if we are to depart from the principle of private issue, the Canadian system of regarding the issue as really equivalent to gold certificate is a safe one. To the extent to which we depart from that principle we shall be in deep waters, not knowing when we shall safely make port. When we divorce the issue from banking we cannot tell, without a large experience, what ought to be held. Before the Australian note issue was introduced, 52 per cent, of the total liabilities of the banks were represented in coin and bullion, ready at any moment to meet demands in cheques and notes. </para>

                            <para>- I say that 52 per cent, of all the liabilities on demand were represented in coin and bullion; and this was an absolute assurance of the convertibility of the notes at any moment, and of the satisfaction of the demands for export and commercial purposes. That assurance we cannot have with the Commonwealth note issue, though the ultimate solvency in either case is absolutely unquestioned. There is no doubt as to the capacity of the banks, because notes are made a first charge; nor is there any doubt as to the ultimate solvency of die Commonwealth. The_only point is whether, when the notes are to be -exchanged for gold, they can at .once be met by the Government, and the necessities of external trade met. And I think we ought to have a longer experience than we are likely to get in two or three years, before we depart from a principle which, I think, is a fairly sound one. </para>

                        <para>-- Those of us who opposed the Government mote issue did so chiefly because of the fear that the pressure on the Treasurer to relax the stringency of the measure would be so enormous that he would have to give way ; and this Bill is a verification of the arguments we then used. Before the ink is dry, as it were, on the original measure, we have before us a proposed amendment making the gold reserve less than was originally intended. What does. the Treasurer expect to get out of this ? He expects to avoid the necessity of keeping a full reserve, and proposes to substitute only a quarter reserve; and if he takes full advantage of the measure - though he has promised to keep 40 per cent. - to have the handling of £2,250,000 of gold, which he can invest, say, at 3 per cent., realizing a little over £60,000 a year. To imperil the credit of the Commonwealth note issue for the sake of £60,000 a year is a very risky and rash experiment; and I hope the Treasurer will not go on with it. He has cited the Queensland experience, which, of course, is valuable, so far as it goes ; but Queensland finance is overshadowed entirely by the great banking institutions which operate in that, as well as in the other States. There might, for instance, be a panic in Queensland which those great banking institutions would hardly feel, so that I cannot see that the experience of that State, comparatively small, though important, as it is, has any bearing on what might be the experience of the whole Commonwealth. </para>

For the reasons I have indicated, the Queensland National , Bank might keep a much smaller supply of gold against a note issue, knowing that the other banking institutions are so firmly rooted in the State that they could afford to run risks, which, if taken by the whole Commonwealth, might be very disastrous.

                            <para>- That is the reserve kept in England, Germany, and all civilized nations; and Australia ought to keep as large a percentage as any of those countries which are in touch with the rest of the world. We are an isolated country ; and,  1  suppose that, if a sudden demand for gold were made, it would occupy a month to have it shipped here from the nearest port, or, at any rate, from London, the financial centre. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. War is not a likely contingency, but we were very near it not long ago, and it might break out on any day. At any rate, it is a contingency against which we ought to provide. There is no doubt that the big banks on which the commercial solvency of this great country depends regard this gold reserve as absolutely necessary to protect the notes they hold. They look on the notes as something they can take any day to the Treasury and say, " Here is your commitment on demand, and we should like your gold to meet demands which are made on us, and which we must satisfy." We have heard a great deal of talk about going cap in hand to the various banks; and I should like the Treasurer to think what the present position is. He has issued notes on demand to the banks to the amount of £6,000,000, while the public hold notes to the amount of .£4,000,000, and he has only <inline font-style="italic">£5,000,000</inline> in gold to meet the  demands which the banks might make. If war were to break out, and a great demand were made by banks from the other side, as is very likely, this being a debtor country </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the figures are as I have just stated ; and, supposing a crisis or war were to arise, the Treasurer would be in the position of going cap in hand to the banks, because he would be short by £[1,000,000 in what he owed them. That would be a very grave position. I am not thinking of the .dignity of the Commonwealth, because this is too serious a matter to regard from that point of view - it is not a case of dignity, but of cash. I am afraid that the depletion of the reserve will cause a certain amount of discredit to our note issue. I am very pleased, of course, to hear the assurance we have from the Treasurer; and I hope he will go a little further. I do not wish for one moment to discredit the Treasurer's word, which I would take as soon as that of any human being; but we may not always have the present Prime Minister m office. I suggest that an amendment should be made in the Bill providing that the reserve shall not be depleted below 40 per cent, until after the next election. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer would require 35 per cent, as 'a margin. When I complete a business transaction, the buyer of a property, for instance, though he does not in the least doubt my word, always likes to have the contract in black and white, in view of accidents. I do not desire to see the Treasurer subject to the enormous strain that may at any time occur. However, I have made a suggestion, and I can only say that I am very sorry that we have had this measure introduced. We are a debtor country ; and the higher we keep our credit the cheaper we shall get our money. We can- save infinitely more than £[60,000 a year in one or two great loan conversion transactions. We have loans that must be renewed from- time to time; and if we injure our credit in any way, we may have to pay 1 per cent, more, which would mean an infinitely larger sum than we are likely to gain by the measure before us. However, we have made our  protest;  and, at any rate, we have an assurance that the margin shall be 40 per cent, until after the next election. </para>

                        <para>.- The idea of a safe margin does not seem to be based on actual or known facts, but rather on an expression of opinion by gentlemen who have studied financial questions. On one side we are told? that it must be 25 per cent., and, on the other, that the reserve must be larger. The Leader of the Opposition was, I think, right in suggesting that at this stage of our history it would be well to be on the safe side, even though we have to hold a larger reserve than is absolutely necessary. Very little harm could come of such a course, whereas a mistake on the other side would have very far-reaching results. This is not a party measure in any sense of the term; and, as I do not feel convinced that we are right in reducing the reserve to 25 per cent., I shall vote against the Bill if it goes to 'a division. I think it would be better if we waited until after the next election before placing further legislation of this kind on the statute-book. I do not know what is to be gained by passing a measure which is to have nb effect until next Parliament. The subject has been introduced a,t a time when we are sitting night and day to get through business, and members are- being asked not to discuss anything at length, because of the short space of time available. I must, therefore, content myself with saying that, inasmuch as there does not seem to be available any experience similar to our own which will enable us to say what is the line dividing, safety f mm risk, and whether the reserve should be 25 per cent, or any other proportion, it would be better, for the sake of our financial credit, to postpone this legislation until we have had a longer experience of the present system. We shall then be able to legislate in the light of facts, instead of in pursuance of mere opinion. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The Treasurer is at present permitted to invest any remainder he may have on deposit in? any bank, and he will, therefore, be at liberty to invest it in the CommonwealthBank, although by doing so he will subject it to the ordinary banking risks. I -suspect that that is what he intends to do. There is nothing to prevent him from lending the money to the Commonwealth Bank, and then lending it back from the bank to himself for the construction of public works. Does he propose to deposit this money with the Commonwealth Bank? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member was a party to it, and he is now abandoning it without giving us any reason for doing so. He says that he does not wish to use the money that will be liberated, and has promised to scrupulously maintain a gold reserve of 40 per cent. until after the next election. That being so, what need is there for the Bill ? It has not been introduced to meet any great public demand. I see no reason why, at the end of the session, we should be engaged in the consideration of a proposal of this magnitude if the provisions of the measure are not to have immediate effect. They are viewed with grave apprehension by the leading financial institutions and authorities in Australia, as is evidenced by the protest of the Associated Banks. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware that there was any exception. The consensus of opinion seems to be that this is a dangerous innovation. The gold backing for the issue over £7,000,000 was provided for at the instance of the banks, and on the understanding that if it were provided they would assist in making the note issue a success. They have done their part, and now hold more than three-fifths of the note issue; so that they are materially interested in its success, and are therefore entitled to be heard. They fear that under the new arrangement they might find it necessary, in the ordinary course of business, to Convert their notes into gold, and that there might not be sufficient gold in the Treasury to meet their demands. Let me read their protest - </para>

                        <para>The purpose of the Government in holding a reserve of pound for pound beyond £7,000,000 was understood to be the protection of note-holders by insuring payment in full in coin of all notes presented. If, however, the present fixed proportion is altered, as now suggested, and the banks for any reason found it necessary to materially reduce the amount of their Commonwealth notes, it would seem that the reduced gold reserve would not suffice to pay in lull the notes held by the banks. </para>

                    <para class="block">A calculation shows us that it would reduce the gold reserves from  £4,750,000  to  £2,500,000,  leaving a deficiency of over  £500,000  sterling in case the banks sent down the note issue to  £7,000.000.  That is why they are alarmed at the proposed innovation. No doubt the assurance given to-day by the Prime Minister that this amending Bill will be practically a dead letter for a considerable time will have a reassuring effect, but it shows that there is no necessity whatever on public grounds for this amendment. If the Prime Minister thinks he is in a position to hold this gold reserve of  £4,000,000  for a year or two to come, why not make it part of the law that it shall be so held instead of allowing it to be merely dependent upon a verbal undertaking?

                    <para class="block">These are very serious warnings coming from the financial institutions of Australia. It may be that coming events cast their shadows before. The banks see that the issue already placed upon the market, amounting to nearly  £10,000,000,  is not a normal, but an inflated, issue, arising from special circumstances. They may think that a time is coming when they may not be able to hold in their coffers as till money  £6,000,000  in respect of notes, and when they will have to send a lot of those notes to the Commonwealth Treasury to be converted into gold. I have seen it stated on good authority that before this Bill came into operation, the normal note issue was between  £4,000,000  and  £5,000,000 ;.  yet it has now jumped to nearly  £10,000,000. </para>

A time, however, is coming when these notes will be sent into the  Treasury, and  naturally the banks are beginning to feel anxious. It is obvious that if this gold backing be abolished,, there will not be that security which the banking institutions deem necessary. I join in the warnings and the protests uttered by the honorable member for Fawkner and the honorable member for Angas, for I regard this Bill as proposing a serious and dangerous change in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the banks, which may bring discredit on our note issue. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to say but little on this question, for the reason probably that I recognise that, whatever may be said by the Opposition, the intentions of the Government will be carried out, and the Bill will be passed. When the Prime Minister introduced the original Bill, he was asked by the bankers to consent to the particular provisions regarding the gold reserve that were ultimately embodied in it. As honorable members are aware, it was laid down in the principal Act that for the first £7,000,000 25 per cent, in gold coin should be held by the Treasury, and that for every £1 note issued over and above that amount a sovereign should be held. I believe the reason for the latter stipulation is that there are times in Australia when the extent of our credit issues vary considerably. Australia is peculiarly situated in some respects, and from time to time we see enormous fluctuations in the volume of credit. Whether that credit is issued by the Commonwealth, by banks, or by private individuals, it will suffer contraction and experience expansion, the Commonwealth credit being open to exactly the same influences as is private credit.  Dur.ing  a time of expansion the note issue will naturally expand with all credit, and during a time of rapid contraction the note issue should contract proportionately with all credit. One of the two great essentials in respect of a note issue is elasticity. We need to take care that it will automatically adjust itself to natural contractions and expansions of credit from time to time. That is a fundamental principle in respect of the note issue, and we should pass such provisions as will secure its observance. A Government note issue is unlike that of a bank, which is daily passing in and out over the counter, and which automatically adjusts itself to the movements in credit. The bankers asked the Prime Minister to incorporate in the Bill a special provision that, once, the note issue got beyond a certain amount, he should be compelled to hold a sovereign for every note sent out ; so that when there was a contraction of credit, the bankers, finding their own issues contracted, and, possibly, being met at the same time with adverse foreign exchanges, would be able to present their notes at the Commonwealth Treasury with an absolute assurance that when they did present them within the normal contraction of credit the Treasurer would not have the slightest difficulty in meeting them. That is why, I believe, the bankers were so insistent at the time upon this provision, which is now being swept away by the Bill, and which, to my mind, constitutes one of the greatest safeguards of the Act. Immediately after the original Bill became law, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> French, general manager of the Bank of New South Wales, in the course of a public address, made mention of the note issue, and said - </para>

                        <para>While I would have preferred to see a provision of one-third backing in coin, yet, taking everything into consideration and believing that ' in practice at least one-third will be kept in hand, I do not anticipate <inline font-style="italic">nay</inline> difficulties; while with regard to any further issues (i.e., over £7,000,000), the Statute provides that there shall be a sovereign behind every note issued. This is a great safeguard, and we must hope that nothing will induce the Federal Parliament to depart from the sound principle thereby given effect to. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is not twelve months since the first Australian note was issued, yet we are now faced with a proposal to sweep away the very safeguards which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. French</inline> urged that Parliament should retain. The Prime Minister may think that he is at perfect liberty to ignore the opinions of men who are high in the financial world to-day; but surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. French</inline> had nothing to gain when he expressed this view, since the principal Act has already been assented to. He uttered that warning, feeling, no doubt, as every one must with regard to any State note issue, which is guarded by reserves set up by Parliament, that those reserves and safeguards are subject at all times to political influence. That is one of the worst features of any State note issue.. However perfect a system may be as first introduced, there is always the danger that the same popular authority which established the original safeguards may later on sweep those safeguards away. That is what is happening in this case. We have in this Bill a whittling down of the safeguards inserted in the principal Act which are absolutely essential to the safety of the note issue at a time of great stress and. panic. The Treasurer has stated his intention of retaining a gold reserve of 40 per cent, for the next eighteen months, so that he will have to keep in the Treasury practically every sovereign he has there at present. In the circumstances, he might have left well alone, and let us have further experience. As the interest reserve gradually accumulates, time will inevitably give us more experience and a still greater reserve, so that it is possible that ultimately we might be able to reduce the reserves somewhat from what they are to-day. At the same time, I deprecate any interference with' them. This is one of the things in which it is almost always better to err on the side of safety, because we never know what may be in front of us. When the original Bill was before the House, the Treasurer said that, in his opinion, the provision now being repealed was a safeguard. He also used these words - </para>

As the quarterly averages of the banks appearing -in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Insurance and Banking Record</inline> for last month show, no less than £6,056,894 worth of Australian notes are held by the banks, or practically two-thirds of the issue. If the banks liked to present at the Treasury half the notes they hold, the Treasurer could not pay them without breaking into the statutory reserve that he is obliged to keep. He holds at present only .£63,065 more than he is compelled to hold under the Statute. I think the normal note requirements for currency purposes are about £[4,000,000, but there is always considerable fluctuation. For instance, in 1910, between the months of March and December, in New South Wales alone there was a fluctuation in the ordinary bank note issue of over £500,000. While it may appear that the Treasurer is holding far more gold than is actually necessary, it should te remembered that the issue is not normal, but above ordinary requirements. The banks are holding from £2,000,000 to £3,000.000 worth of notes more than they actually require, and if they chose to present to the Treasurer half of what they hold he could not meet the amount of gold without encroaching upon his statutory reserves. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of the resources of the Commonwealth. It is a question of how much gold the Treasurer has in the Federal Treasury. The note issue at present amounts to £[9,883,969. The statutory reserve is <inline font-style="italic">£4,653,969,</inline> and the Government actually hold £4,697,034. If £[3,000,000 worth of notes were presented to-morrow at the Treasury, the Treasurer would be £[25,000 short in gold, which he could not meet, and yet £3,000,000 is less than half the note holdings of the banks. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say they were. I am simply making a plain statement of absolutely incontrovertible facts. Everything is flourishing to-day, but if we were met by a severe contraction of credit, when the Treasurer could not go down to the banks and get a million pounds in gold, and the notes were coming in on the banks, and if the banks, instead of holding <inline font-style="italic">£6,</inline> 000, 000 of notes, held £8,000,000, and were obliged to meet large payments in gold elsewhere, the position would be very serious. That is why the Treasurer should retain the statutory provision already in existence, and maintain the full reserve for every note that he issues over £[7, 000, 000. </para>

                            <para>- We have heard before that the note issue takes from the people a loan for which they are paid nothing. That is so; but the Government takes the money from the people for the people, instead of banking institutions taking it from them. The bleeding, if any, is being done by the Government for the people. Prior to this it was done by the banking institutions for the benefit of a few private shareholders. The Act was condemned as revolutionary, but now even banking authorities are quoted as saying that it is a sound proposition. The Prime Minister has been lectured by great authorities this afternoon; but I am confident that he knew years ago all the things that he was told to-day. He knows that the safety of the note issue lies in preventing a great and sudden expansion. Provision was made in the Act against such expansion, and  .1  am very glad that the Prime Minister has given the House the assurance which he gave this afternoon. Even without it, I know that he would have kept a very large margin. We were rightly told by the honorable member for Flinders that the point of practical insecurity, where the notes would become inconvertible, would not be when the last sovereign was' paid out, but when the statutory amount which must be kept in reserve had been reached. Under the existing Act, that point can be reached much sooner than might be desirable. If we had to keep a gold reserve of 25 per cent, against the first £7,000,000, and a gold reserve of 100 per cent, against everything above that, it would not take a great fluctuation to bring the Treasurer right up against that position. The honorable member for Richmond says we want elasticity, and that is precisely what this amending Bill will give the Treasurer. It will enable him to keep the note issue safe, because he will have a margin between 25 per cent, and 40 per cent, to fall back upon. One would imagine, to listen to honorable members opposite, that this was a) revolutionary change in the principle, and that we were proposing to keep against the issue above <inline font-style="italic">£7 ,000,000</inline> only 40 per cent, of reserve, as against too per cent, of reserve previously. But, with a total issue of £10,000,000, we should still have the statutory reserve of 25 per cent, against the first £7,000,000, and against the next  £3,000,000  we should have a reserve of 75 per cent. In other words, we should have £2,250,000 of gold against the extra  £3,000,000  of notes. Our short experience has already shown that £7,000,000 is not the normal issue for Australia. It was believed that £7,000,000 would be the normal issue when this provision was made ; but I think we have about the normal issue out at the present time. If anything were to bring about an exceptional expansion of the issue to £^4,000,000, and the surplus was invested, a demand for gold would bring about strange results. The Treasurer, however, would, in these circumstances, hold a sovereign against every note, notwithstanding that he has undertaken to keep a reserve of 40 per cent. The Treasurer and his officers are watching this business, which is a sound one. It does not mean that the Treasurer will have a great deal more money to handle, but he will be provided with something to come and go on. When the honorable member for Richmond was speaking the Prime Minister made an interjection, which I do not think that honorable member rightly understood, because he went on to draw a terrible picture of what the position would be if all the banks were to rake up all the notes throughout Australia and suddenly present them to the Treasury with a demand for gold. Does the honorable member think that the Commonwealth of Australia has no other resources than the sovereigns held in reserve behind the note issue? As a matter of fact, in order to carry on the ordinary business of the Government, the Treasurer has something like £1,000,000 on current account. We have heard a great deal about the isolated and otherwise peculiar position of Australia ; but I think that very circumstance makes us better able to meet sudden demands of the kind anticipated than are other countries of the world. For one thing, we are a gold-producing country, and next we have no great fluctuations in the seasons. Canada, for instance, has all her eggs in one basket, as it were, climatically speaking, whereas in Australia we have all kinds of climates, enabling us to produce all the year round. Under the circumstances we are not so exposed as Canada is to any sudden expansion or contraction of the currency ; and our peculiar position is really to our advantage. I see no danger in the change proposed by this Bill, so long as we have the present Treasurer in office. Of course, there is always a danger in any system of finance or currency, because, if the man at the head of affairs is determined to do wrong he will do so, whatever the law may be. We may be sure, however, that we shall not see the Treasurer " ride for a fall " in this respect. The proposal is to keep a reserve of £4,000,000 in gold against the note, issue of £10,000,000. At present it is necessary to keep a reserve of £4,750,000, and the  difference could be met, if ever it was necessary, from the Treasurer's current account. I certainly should have looked at the matter in a different light had we not the absolute promise that the reserve will be kept at 40 per cent. </para>

There would have been no objection to the direction, " If you wish to vote for Craven, mark your ballot papers thus," but to say that the vote would be void if marked otherwise was a deliberate attempt to mislead the electors, such as we should discountenance.

                    <para>.- In paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> the words " directions intended or likely to mislead," are used, but in the proviso only the words " directions intended to mislead " appear. It seems to me that the same language should be used in both portions of the amendment. What directions would be likely to mislead would be difficult to decide. What might mislead an innocent like myself would not mislead experienced politicians like the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. This provision will probably give the police magistrates who have to deal with the cases brought under it a fine opportunity to display their political bias. They are sure to find that directions issued on behalf of their friends are not likely to mislead any intelligent person. If we think the electors not sufficiently intelligent to avoid being misled by the palpable misrepresentations which are sometimes circulated, we should leave no loop-hole for conflicting decisions under which one man may be punished and another escape. </para>

The insertion of the clause was objected to on the ground that there was not a full attendance when it was made; but the attendance then was better than it is now, and we shall stultify ourselves if we reverse our decision, which was come to by a considerable majority. I should offer no objection to this course had we now a full House, but I have noticed certain things to-day which determine me, if the recommittal be agreed to, not to consider members or Ministers, but to give very lengthy reasons why the clause should remain in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - When this clause was inserted in the Bill, I thought it of sufficient importance to warrant further consideration. There may be different opinions held regarding the action taken in recommitting the clause, but I thought it advisable when it was first proposed that further time for consideration, should be allowed, and I therefore agreed to recommit it. I must say, however, that since then, no practical solution of the difficulty seems  to have been discovered, and the Government intend either to give the clause as it stands, or some substitute for it, a trial. </para>

I think it would be a good thing for the public if all articles appearing in the press throughout the year were signed, but since we are dealing now with an Electoral Bill, we cannot insert in it a provision to that effect. It would appear to me to be necessary to impose some limitation as to the time in respect of which published articles shall be signed, and I therefore propose to make it " on and after the date of issue and before the return of any writ." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has informed me that a writ is sometimes not returned until a month after the taking of the poll ; but I do not think that any real harm would be done in requiring those commenting on the result of an election to attach their names to their articles. As this is a very important provision, I shall perhaps be pardoned, even at this late stage of the session, in making a few observations as to the necessity for it. I propose in the first place to reply as briefly as possible to some of the arguments that have been advanced in opposition to the proposal in a leading article published by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> That newspaper claims that in France a man frequently uses the press to force his way into Parliament. What objection can there be to that? If a man by signing articles written by him, and published in the press, can show the people that he is a fit and proper person to represent them, why should he not be elected? Would that not be preferable to the present system, by which the daily papers place thousands of copies before the people every morning, giving a ticket of candidates whom, in their opinion, the electors should choose? If a man proves by his signed articles his capacity to assist in governing the country, he ought to be able to come here. The method now adopted by the press is distinctly wrong. Sometimes the papers will select a ticket of names, and suppress all reference to the other candidates, except in personal paragraphs reflecting upon them. Some candidates for Parliament supported by the daily press are not able to write their own speeches, which are sometimes written for them by the journalists, who do not sign their names. Rather than that such a candidate should be forced into Parliament, the man who was capable of writing the speeches ought to be returned. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to hear from the honorable member for Bendigo a legal definition of the word " report." Apparently, all the Opposition want is a legal quibble, in order to provide a "get out," thus nullifying the whole clause. </para>

                    <para>. - A report is the account given in a newspaper of a meeting at which certain speakers express opinions. It is proposed that this shall be signed by the reporter or reporters ; but it is not they who will be answerable for the report that actually appears. Their account of what is said at the meeting passes through the hands of a sub-editor, and is treated according to its interest and the exigencies of space. My experience is that reports are faithful, except so far as necessary condensations or omissions may alter the colour of the speech; but honorable members cannot put upon either the reporter or the sub-editor, in the case of the report of a speech, any such personal responsibility as usually attaches to the writer of a letter or article. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment in its present form might lead to some confusion. If "writer" means " author," there is no need for the change, and if the word does not mean " author," it must mean something else. I take it the desire is to have the article signed by the author, and not necessarily by the person who actually wrote it. </para>

That newspaper unblushingly told us the other day that the journalists are not to write reports or articles which they think to be right and correct, but what they are told to write by the authorities in conformity with the policy of the paper. The honorable member for Bendigo tried to have the word "report" omitted; but I know of cases where reports handed in by the reporters have been so mutilated that they would not recognise their own work, and yet, on the mutilated versions, criticism has been founded. </para>

                    <para>.- I suggest to the honorable member for Capricornia that the words " writer and author " would meet the case. When a journalist reports a speech, he is technically the author of that speech. A journalist published some of Lord Rosebery's speeches, and described himself as the author; and when Lord Rosebery took the case into Court, the decision was given in favour of the reporter. </para>

                    <para>.- No doubt, a reporter who misrepresents a speaker in a report will be responsible, but I take it that the word " author " has a more definite meaning as attached to the writer of leading articles, and so forth. Such a production can be traceable to one person, and not to a series of persons who may have had a. hand in the writing out of the report of a speech. </para>

It is provided that the production shall be signed by the " author or authors, giving his or their true name and address." This presumes that the author or authors have only one name and one address ; and I suggest that the words " names and addresses " should be used. </para>

                    <para>.- An amusing skit has been published on the proposal that reporters shall attach their names and addresses to reports. We have been asked to imagine a report of a speech of thirty lines signed with the names and addresses of four reporters who have been concerned in the work. It is ridiculous to suppose that four reporters would be employed on so short a report ; but, if they are engaged in producing a report of, say, a couple of columns, their names and addresses can appear at the end. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause indicates a good intention, but evidences little wisdom. In trying to entrap the press, we shall only place ourselves is difficulties. The libel law sufficiently protects every person from grave injury, and in any case the signing of articles and the like would give no more protection than we have. Those who desire to publish untrue or unworthy statements could, under a system of dummying, provide names to take the authorship for them. The signing of articles is, in my opinion, subversive of the liberty of the press. </para>

                    <para>- - I agree with the honorable member for Macquarie that the provision makes a farce of legislation. The politician who cannot stand criticism, and- even abuse, from opponents and the newspapers, is not worthy of being called a man; and the signing of articles and. the like would do nothing to make his position better. On the other hand, to insist on it is an interference with the liberty of the press. I am surprised that the National Parliament of Australia should fear criticism. Surely  the public can judge the actions of members, and it is in the interests of the people that the press should be able to criticise them freely. I have suffered as much as any man from press criticism, but I have survived.I cannot understand a paltry proposal of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- Who is the guilty person? A reporter might give a fair and unbiased account of an election speech which the sub-editor, for want of space or some other reason, might cut down to one-fourth of its length, in the process doing injustice to the man who made the speech. In that case, should the reporter be liable? The clause fairly bristles with ridiculous possibilities, and we should do our best to make it intelligible, so that the Courts may know what is meant by it. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the honorable member will not take the point that the provision marked <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is out of order. If a reporter's signature is not attached to a report through the fault of some other person, he can exonerate himself by proving that he is not to blame. As for the statement made by the honorable member for Macquarie, surely we are not to believe that reputable editors and newspapers proprietors, occupying a distinguished position in society, would stoop to the subterfuge of inducing men to attach bogus names to articles? Journalism has greatly altered during the last quarter of a century, and there are many reasons why the clause should be amended in the way that I propose; but, since it is the evident desire of honorable members that we should proceed to a vote without delay, I shall content myself with moving </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to argue the question of the constitutionality of the proposal, but I should like to know what object there could be in submitting it if it be not to satisfy mere idle curiosity as to the names of persons who criticise honorable members in the press? I can hardly imagine honorable members on either side invoking the law of libel against the reporters and others whose business it is to report what takes place on the hustings or elsewhere in connexion with elections. If they were invoking the law of libel, I apprehend they would invoke it against the proprietors of the newspapers - against the men who can pay - and not against their fellow workers in connexion with journalism. My chief objection to the amendment is that it will serve no useful purpose, but, speaking as a party man, that it will strike a blow purely at our fellow workers in the journalistic world. It is going to hit a section of the wage-earners. It is going to make the gentlemen who write articles for wealthy newspaper proprietors disclose their names, and so handicap them in their desire to earn an honest living. If it pleases my honorable friends to recriminate upon their fellow unionists of the Australian Journalists Association, they are welcome to do so, but I do not join hands with them. </para>

                        <para>- It has been said that a journalist should not write that in which he does not wholly believe. I desire to ask honorable members on both sides if their view?, their votes, or their acts have ever been coloured to any extent by the views of any considerable number of their own constituents ? If this lofty standard is to be adopted in respect of newspaper writers, it is only fair that we should apply it to ourselves. I almost feel disposed to quote the honorable member for Bourke, who, speaking during the discussion on the Tariff in this House, said, to the amusement of honorable members - I do not know that he was quite serious, however - that he spoke with great feeling, because the persons interested in the raw material, as well as in the finished article relating to the item under discussion, resided in considerable numbers in his electorate. </para>

But if honorable members say that it is dishonorable for a man to advocate in the press, for pay, a cause in which privately he does not wholly believe, I can only reply that that is a sentiment of hypocrisy to which I cannot subscribe. </para>

                        <para>- The. honorable member can speak to say that there is a purpose in view, but not to tell me what that purpose is. I know that the press has frequently misrepresented honorable members most grossly, and no one resents that sort of thing more than I do. I know that men have been cruelly and grossly misrepresented, and that some have been hounded down by the press. No one can have sympathy with such tactics. But when such a thing takes place, we know what to do. We attack the proprietor or the publisher of the newspaper. We attack the man at the back of the newspaper - the man who actually does the wrong. In this, as in other matters, we attack the employer, not the employe. We have an Employers' Liability Act, under which the employer is responsible for certain acts of negligence on the part' of his servants, and I hope that we shall have a Workmen's Compensation Act, which will make the employer still more responsible than he is at present. Labour legislators do not seek to hit at the worker in other industries, but they will do so in this case. They are going to say that the man who is working for a weekly wage - who, in many cases, does not receive a sum greatly in excess of that which we are paid for our services - shall be penalized. He is to be called upon to disclose his identity, and advertise himself in the press. He is to be hit, and for what purpose? These men-  are employes, and I ask honorable members whether there is any industry or occupation in which members of the Labour party make men similarly situated disclose their names? None whatever. It is said that, because unfair statements are made in the press, we must ascertain the names of the writers. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Batman referred to a certain remark I made in connexion with another matter. Honorable members who were present on that occasion will remember that I said that the contesting parties on the question were resident within my own district, but that that did not in the least affect my judgment. I added that, like the majority of honorable members here, I was animated by those national and patriotic motives which are alone the subject of our solicitude. Now we get a sample of the reporting type of man who omits the context, turns my statement upside down, and represents me as stating that my decision upon the question was affected by the fact that the contesting parties were within my constituency. The honorable member for Batman asks in what other industry such a law as this is to be found. The honorable member does not need to go outside of the industry. He will find an instance in the law requiring the name of the printer and publisher to appear on a newspaper. The honorable member takes the view that the proprietor of a paper has to be prosecuted, but it is the printer and publisher who stands as the legal entity to be proceeded against, whether he is a dummy or not. The honorable member for Balaclava asked why we should be afraid of publicity, or of being assailed anonymously? There is a world of difference between us who occupy seats in this Chamber, and speak on the public platform, and the men who write anonymously. We assail each other, but, at least, our attacks on each other are limited by the fact that we know each other, and that we have, at least, a little shame. We do not say on the public platform what we should be ashamed to say to one another's faces. We use our influence against each other as parties and as individuals, but we stand upon the basis of facts, however much we may colour them; and, at least, we know the men who assail our policy, our principles, and our reputation. Some one spoke of the freedom of the press ; but who were the men who built it up but the Leigh Hunts and the Cobbetts, and did they not publish their names ? If I use a newspaper to make an attack upon another member of this House, should I do it under the shield of anonymity? Should I publish anything which I would be ashamed to say from a platform or from the floor of this Chamber? Is there any reason why I should shake hands and be friendly with a man in the lobbies, and then walk down to a newspaper office in Collins-street, and stab him in the back by publishing about him things which I would be ashamed to say to his face? Why should not every man connected with the daily press be subject in his occupation 'to the same publicity as we have to face? The honorable member for Balaclava said newspaper people could easily get round this provision by using the name of some nonentity. Let them, and the article will have exactly the value which belongs to that nonentity. There are self-respecting men of repute connected with the journalistic world who will not permit their names to be utilized by the  proprietors of great journals as dummy signatures to statements which they could not justify when face to face with the men who were assailed. The clause will not in any way lower the standing of Australian journalists ; on the contrary, it will give them a status, and an independence of their proprietors which they do not now possess. Their market value will rise in proportion to the reputations which their writings earn for them. Men who value their reputations will write only those things which will bring honour to themselves. Without in any way reflecting on any person, I would ask the honorable member for Batman if, after all, he has been influenced in this matter by national and patriotic motives, or by the fact that he is intimately associated with the journalists' organization? </para>

                        <para>- Until the honorable member rose, no  speaker  in this debate had introduced a single word of reflection. There was no need for him to do it ; and I tell him, with all respect, that he should have been the last to do it. I can see no reason why the clause should not be carried in its entirety ; and why, at those great crises in the history of our country, and probably in our own lives, when we are contesting elections, we should not strip the disguises off the men who in the columns of the daily press assail us, whether we are members of' the Labour or the Liberal party ? Let us know who are the persons who abuse us through the medium of these great dailies. I do not think that at any previous period of the existence of the Labour party its members have done a better deed in the interests of true freedom than they are doing in this instance. </para>

                    <para>.- My apology for addressing any further remarks to the Committee lies in the fact that some members of the Labour party are prepared to vote against this proposal. With the honorable member for Bourke, I think the carrying of it will be a distinct advance in civilization, The newspaper proprietor of a few years ago was a single individual, with a. reputation to maintain or lose. Many newspapers of to-day are owned by men who are interested in pastoral properties, gold-mining, coal -mining, copper mining, and other undertakings. The paper is published, as a rule, for profit, and as a rule is opposed to any radical or labour legislation which will in any way diminish the dividends of its shareholders or directors. Journalism is not now what it used to be. It is more of a commercial machine; but I would ask those pressmen on whose behalf the honorable member for Batman has appealed, why they are not prepared to follow the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. Ward, the editor of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph*</inline> Years ago, when the capitalistic directorate of that paper wanted him to advocate the selling of the Stateowned trams to private capitalists, he said, "I will leave the paper first," and he did so. Whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> may do in the future, however conservative he may become as he grows older, we shall always remember to his credit that he left the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> rather than do the public of New South Wales an injustice by advocating something in which he did not believe.

                <para class="block">The opinions which, journalists write in the newspapers are either their own or they are not. Either they believe in them or they do not. If they do not believe in them, if they are prostituting their minds for the purpose- of gain, what is the difference between them and the unfortunate harlots who walk Collins-street, selling; their bodies for bread? This clause will compel those men to choose between earning their living honestly and earning it dishonestly. I believe, with the honorable member for Bourke, that it will be better for- journalism if men have to sign their names to what they write. There are able men to-day working for the capitalistic newspapers who are never known to the general public, and when their services are dispensed with they have no asset in their past work. All their good work has gone into the pockets of the people who own the newspapers. It will be far better for them when they can sign- their articles. The public will then know their abilities, and journals will be competing with one another for their services. There are to-day people writing leading and other articles for newspapers inflaming the public mind on defence and other questions who are ashamed to sign their names. There are people in the Parliaments, or the civil services of the various States, who are writing leaders in the papers criticising their own Ministers. I know a man who was a civil servant in South Australia, and who was for- years retained as a leader-writer for one of the dailies. Many people are employed by the commercial newspapers to write leading articles, and the time has come for them to come out into the daylight, instead of skulking behind the curtain of anonymity. Let them give expression to their views and stand by them, as we have to do. Honorable members talk about being afraid of criticism. We are not afraid of criticism; but let us know the man who utters it, and then perhaps we shall be able to put a little of the acid of criticism on him, and defend ourselves the better. ' </para>

                    <para>. - It is much to be regretted that so much heat has been introduced into the debate. In the circumstances, it is obvious that we are not competent to give the proposal fair and judicial attention. We have all suffered under the lash of the press from time to time, but any display of active resentment or vindictive legislation is unworthy of us. Many press articles, particularly on special subjects,' are already signed ; and if there is anything to be said in favour of the signing of leading articles, there is no need for a comprehensive clause of this character, which embraces every little miserable paragraph of the most simple character commenting on candidates or political parties. Does that not reduce journalism to an absurdity, and make it ridiculous in the eyes of the world, so far as Australia is concerned? The real meaning of this provision is that reporters are to be penalized. I have listened in vain to ascertain the object of this legislation, or any substantial argument in its favour. </para>

                        <para>- If any injustice is done by a journal there is no difficulty in getting compensation. Where libel is established and damage is shown to have been done newspapers are mulcted very heavily as a rule, because the sympathies of the public, and of the jury, are generally with the complainant ; as a matter of fact, newspapers go to Court, practically with a degree of prejudice against them. Reporters, under this clause, will be exposed to risks for the most innocent acts; and what is the benefit or advantage to be gained ? No one has ventured to say that the public will be benefited in any way; and the only effect will be to add liabilities to the occupation of men who earn their living in employment by newspaper proprietors. ^ The reporter is only doing his duty ; and if any malice is introduced the pro- vprietary is responsible. The reporter who simply records the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so</inline> " delivered an able and lucid address " on a particular occasion, will have to sign the report. Does that not, in itself, reduce journalism to a burlesque? This legislation is ludicrous and unworthy of a National Parliament, bearing as it does on its face, resentment and vindictiveness. </para>

That honorable member asked whether the object was merely idle curiosity, and, in return, I ask what objection there can be to the provision? Is the objection not that the newspaper writers are afraid to sign their names? Arguments which go forth to the world on any question, political or otherwise, should rest on their merits, and not on any fictitious value imparted by the immortal "we." If an argument is good it will carry conviction, but we ought to know the gentleman who advances the argument. Why should a journalist, because he has the ability to write, be placed in a different position from that of a  speaker,  whose ability is displayed in speaking? Why should the  speaker  on the platform have to come out in the open, while the newspaper writer is shrouded in mystery and licensed to stab in the dark? </para>

                        <para>- We are not dealing with legal quibbles, but with the question on its merits. The electors, who have to decide great issues, should be able to judge of the merits of the different cases put forward, and that is not possible with the present anonymity of the press. As a matter of fact, some journalists write for different newspapers, and speak, with different voices ; and if that fact were known, their writings could be judged on their merits. The honorable member for Batman asks whether there is anything wrong or dishonorable in men advocating something in which they do not believe, even when the work in hand is the building up of a nation. There I join issue with the honorable member, and say that there is something wrong and dishonorable in such a position. </para>

                        <para>- I think it will. A public  speaker  may not speak with two voices without being publicly condemned - he may not advocate Free Trade in New South Wales to-day and Protection in Victoria to-morrow - and then excuse himself on the ground that he is merely earning his living. When the writers of articles are known, their arguments can be treated on their merits, and discounted as they deserve. We wish to know who are the gentlemen who shake us by the hand and then stab us in the dark through the columns of the press. The honorable member for Ballarat said that journalists are advocates, and are justified in advocating causes which may not be their own; but advocates in the legal profession do not go into Court incognito, with masks on their faces. In what other profession or business, where there is a chance of swaying public opinion, can a man work without coming out into the open ? We are not attempting to destroy, the freedom of the press; but we have a right to know who is endeavouring to guide opinion when great questions of public policy are before the country. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is ; and, in any case, there is always the law of libel for those who are aggrieved, though I know that most people do not care to go to law on account of the expense. This clause will affect every individual who, during an election, writes a letter to the press bearing on political matters, and the result will inevitably be that some most valuable contributions will not now see the light. There are cases in which such writers, for very good reasons affecting their families, are afraid to sign their names ; so that not only newspapers, but individuals, will be affected in a way which I do not consider advisable. I believe in restricting as little as possible the liberty of the people ; and, therefore, I shall vote against this clause. . My own belief is that the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches to-day simply and solely on account of the unfair treatment meted out to them by the newspapers, treatment which called forth the sympathies of the electors when it was discovered that the party is sincere and honest in the efforts they are making. A liberty-loving people will always stand by what is right, and they are quick to discern when the press goes to unfair extremes. </para>

                    <para>. - During the debate this afternoon, when my comrade on my right was speaking, I interjected hotly, because I understood him' to be insisting on the right of the working men to employ hired assassins. I do not wish the impression to go abroad that the party thinks that it has that right. While, in the ordinary walks of life, a man may sell his services to his enemy, he has no right to lend his intellect to the power of wealth to besmirch his fellows. Our object is to scotch the dirty, yellow journalism. I take no exception to the  remarks of honorable members who, like the honorable member for Balaclava, are backed by the money power. That power has always influenced the press throughout the world, and even the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> is subject to it. But knowing the yellow journalism of America, I say that we are justified in trying to prevent it from getting a footing here. I delight in the Opposition of the press, but it is not too much to ask it for one month in every three years to be consistent, honorable, and clean. It has been suggested that we are legislating to interfere with the press at all times, but these provisions will take effect only during election campaigns, when public affairs and the actions of politicians are, so to speak, <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline></para>

                    <para>The Bill embodies no new principle, and provides simply for an appropriation of £4,000,000 for the purposes of the Trust Fund established for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. The principle of these funds is that more than one payment may be made into them, but that the total payments made cannot exceed the amount for which the appropriation is made. The Trust Fund will shortly be exhausted, and this Bill simply provides that any moneys that are available may be paid into it from time to time for the purposes of the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. The fund is a kind of big bag into which any moneys available for the purpose may be placed. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members have had this Bill on their files for some days, and I am pleased to say that it passed through the Senate with the unanimous approval of both sides of the Chamber. It contains three principal points. We are giving an expensive education and training to certain of our Australian lads in the Naval College, and it is essential that, after the Commonwealth has educated and trained them', there should be some guarantee that their services will be subsequently at the disposal of the Commonwealth for a reasonable time. It is therefore proposed that the lads may, of their own consent, and with the consent of parents or guardians, enter into contracts carrying them over the age of twenty-one, so that their services may be continuously available to the Commonwealth, but so that they cannot contract themselves into any liability beyond the age of thirty years. When the Imperial Conference met in England earlier this year, an agreement was entered into by the Imperial Government and the Dominion Governments respecting the discipline of the Navy and certain interchanges that might be necessitated in times of stress or in training. With the consent of the Commonwealth Government, our Fleet Unit may at some future time be working or training in conjunction with the Fleet Units of other parts of the Empire, or even with the Head-quarter's Navy itself. In such circumstances, the Bill provides that the senior officer on the station at that moment may, with the consent of the Commonwealth, or the consent of any other Dominion Government, take charge of the whole of the vessels in that area, but so that the internal arrangements of the Unit will not be unnecessarily interfered with. So far as the general operations for training purposes or in times of stress are concerned, the senior officer, whether from Canada, Australia, or England, is, for the time being, to have charge of the fleet then assembled. The third point concerns the matter of discipline. In the event of a breach by any of the officers, it is made possible for a court martial to be established of officers from any portion of the fleet then assembled, whether they come from the Canadian, Australian, or Imperial Unit. A position may arise when the rank of the offending officer in our Fleet Unit would be such that we could not have sufficient officers to constitute a court martial to try him. This Bill enables a court martial to be established so that any officer may be tried. There is, however, a reservation that, no matter what the circumstances are, it will be impossible for any court martial, however constituted, to inflict the penalty of death upon an Australian officer without the consent of the Governor-General of the Commonwealth. </para>

I hope that its provisions will not require to be taken advantage of so far as they are compulsory or mandatory, but that the spirit of the young men of Australia will respond to the call of the sea as heartily and thoroughly as did that of their ancestors. We trust by their aid .to constitute in this portion of the Empire an Australian squadron flying the old flag and taking its part beside the other squadrons of the fleet on the day of necessity. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is another brief measure which has received the unanimous approval of the Senate. In the attempt to establish a scheme of universal training, a slight weakness has been found in the Defence Act passed in 1909. Certain penalties may be imposed on lads who meet on parade grounds, but it is impossible to inflict any penalty upon those who deliberately abstain from attending parade, until they reach the age of eighteen. The Government ask in the Bill for reasonable power to secure the services of the lads from the ages of fourteen to eighteen, so that they may go through the ordinary drills prescribed for their benefit and the general good of the Commonwealth. This omission from the Act of 1909 has been discovered by some of the lads, who refrain from putting in an appearance on the parade ground. A little time ago, the Minister ordered a surprise inspection, and it was found that only a little over 30 per cent, of the lads who should have been on parade were attending to their duties. By closing up the slight loophole that has been found in the Act we shall be doing justice to those who have taken advantage of it, and also to those who are conforming to the requirements of the law. It has also been found that the hours of drill for senior cadets are somewhat excessive, and, after careful inquiry from the experts, it has been decided to reduce them by one-third. At present, the whole-day drill consists of six hours. In "future, it will consist of four hours. The half-day drill will be reduced from three hours to two hours, and the night drill from one and a half hours to one hour. The experts say that this may be safely done without impairing the efficiency of the cadets. At the same time, it will constitute a relief which, I think, the lads will appreciate. Honorable members have from time to time complained that lads have had to walk too far to the parade ground, or have had at times to attend drills in bad weather. The Bill gives power to the Minister, in the event of a lad residing  2  miles or more from the parade ground, to remove the necessity for his attendance, and, in the event of the weather proving inclement, to order that the drill be either left out altogether, or taken at some other and more suitable time. The Bill provides that in certain districts, where it is found that day drills would be an improvement because of local conditions, or the work in which the residents are generally- engaged, the Minister may make arrangements accordingly. These are the three points to which I direct attention, I hope with success. </para>

                        <para>.- After the clear exposition we have heard, the Bill needs no  further discussion, at all events at the second-reading stage. It will be a welcome intimation to all our citizens that, in enforcing discipline under the Defence Act, every proper consideration is being given to the ages of the lads, and to the curtailment qf the demand on them to a minimum consistent with efficiency. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that a Bill has been introduced to make the drills and general compliance with the Defence Act very much easier. No boy under sixteen years of age ought to be compulsorily trained in defence. Even in the matter of physical culture, if a boy, up to sixteen years, is allowed to play as every schoolboy ought to, he will exercise his limbs quite as well and better than under the present system of making him drill for so many hours per week and per month. It is wrong to worry and disturb the mind of a boy of fourteen years of age by compelling him to undergo certain defence drill, making him think of war. </para>

                            <para>- Some parents are too thoughtless, and expect too much from their children. They send them to work at too early an age; and it should not be necessary for a child under sixteen to help to earn the family bread and butter. It is a mistake to expect apprentices between fourteen and fifteen. years of age to give up their Saturday afternoon; and it is equally a mistake to deprive them of the public holidays. When I was a boy in an office, I used to look forward to these vacations; indeed, I think I spent the" rest of the week in looking forward to the Saturday afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I shall point them out. The first request relates to brewers'" pitch, which the Senate desires shall be allowed to remain as before, namely, free ; and the second and third requests are purely verbal.. The fourth request relates to1ginger n.e.i. in brine for the manufacture' of crystallized preserved ginger, and the Senate desire that the duty should be made i£d., instead of id. This is one of the amendments to which I invite honorable members to disagree. It was held that this commodity would compete with green ginger, and that, on that account, there should be a difference in the duty; but if it is brought here in brine, and duty is charged on the latter, there is sufficient difference. This commodity is largely used in manufacture of crystallized ginger, and about 130 tons were made ' here last year. If is stated that unless the duty is put back to id., the industry will be seriously affected. Request No. 5 relates to linen handkerchiefs and serviettes. This House agreed that the duty should? be 25 and <inline font-style="italic">20</inline> per cent. Piece-goods have, all been made free in the Tariff, and the Senate suggests that instead of 25 and 20. per cent, the duty should be 35 and 30 per. cent. I do not ask the House to go back to the duty suggested by me in the new. Tariff, but, as a compromise, to adopt a duty of 30 and 25 per cent., which will, I consider, give protection amounting practically, to prohibition. These are the only two-, items on which I propose to ask honorable members to disagree with the Senate's requests. No. -  6  is a formal request, and. No. 7 refers to an increase in the width of . braid from 2 inches to 3 inches. Request No. 8 is to strike out " gimp n.e.i." This, gimp is not manufactured for any other country in the world except Australia. It is a fancy trimming, and because there was provision for gimp n.e.i. in the Tariff, importers are calling fancy trimmings by that name, and thereby avoid paying a proper amount of duty. The amendment will make gimp dutiable as trimmings. </para>

                        <para>- It is to assist in the administration of the Department. It is now difficult to define what is gimp and what is a trimming, and nowhere else in the world is gimp sold but as a trimming. It is a raw material, like many other articles in the same item in the Tariff. Request No. 9 relates to cutlery, which, "includling silver ferrules or plated articles " was made dutiable by this House at 15 per cent. and 10 per cent. The Senate request that the quoted words shall be left out, and " including the articles named when plated or silver ferruled  " inserted. Request No. 10 has to do with electrical machines and appliances, and provides that preference shall be given to generators for direct couplings to steam turbines. There was previously a preference of 5 per cent., but as the item was removed from 5 per cent, and free to other items which carry a duty of 20 per cent. or12½ per cent. but with no preference, the Senate request that a 5 per cent. preference be maintained. The duty will therefore be 25 per cent. and 20 per cent., and17½ per cent. and12½ per cent. Request No. 11 relates to dextrine, which has given rise to much trouble. I suppose that every honorable member has been interviewed more than once on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. We have to recollect, however, that the Senate decided on this request by a vote of more than two to one, and I do not think it wise at this period of the session to insist. Manufacturers who obtain the advantage of a protective Tariff do not show much patriotism when they are not prepared to pay their fair share of Protection, so that some of their raw material may be manufactured here. I propose to ask the House to agree to the request of the Senate, and leave dextrine free. The next amendment asked for is consequential. Then comes a request for an amendment of the marble and granite duties, which will give a preference of 5 per cent. to the stone coming from Great Britain, most of the granite imported being Aberdeen granite. The Senate asks us to amend , the timber duties in such a way that kauri will be dutiable according to size at the ordinary rates, and white pine and rimu at 6d. per 100 super feet. We fixed the duty on gramaphones at 10 and 5 per cent, so that, making allowance for the free portions, the rates on the cabinets would be equivalent to the furniture duties of 35 and . 30 per cent. ; but the Senate asks us to make the duties 5 per cent., if the imports are from foreign countries, allowing imports from the United Kingdom to come here free. The same Tariff will apply to records. Buggy saddles the Senate asks us to make dutiable at the same rates as harness saddles, because it is held that a distinction cannot be drawn between them ; and the rates will therefore be 6s. and 5s., or 36 and 25 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> The next amendment which we are asked to make will leave hides dutiable at 3s., as from the day of the introduction of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I think that all payments have been made under protest, under section 164 of the Customs Act, with a view to securing refunds. The Senate asks us to permit the importation free of paper-felt or carpet felt for the manufacture of roofing felt, and like substances, subject to the departmental by-laws. It is desired that we shall increase the duty on vehicles from 35 and 30 to 40 and 35 per cent, because we are taxing some of the raw material at the rate of 10 per cent., and it was thought necessary to have a wider margin. The honorable member for Wentworth pointed out that our proposals regarding motor car bodies being made dutiable at £24 10s. and £21, or 35 and 30 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty, were unfair, because no distinction was made between the various kinds of bodies. The Senate asks us to make single-seated bodies dutiable at £17 and £15, double-seated bodies dutiable at £24 10s. and £21, and bodies with fixed or movable canopy tops, such as landaulettes:, limousines, and taxi-cabs, dutiable at £42 and £36. </para>

                        <para>- Previously, the duty was charged <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> It is not likely that second-hand motor cars will now be imported. Most of the motor car bodies are now made in Australia, and members have told me that the Australian bodies are equal to the best made abroad. Only to-day, a fine of £2,800 was imposed in Sydney on an importer who had not been paying the proper rates of duty ; but had the rates been fixed as proposed by the Senate, there could have been no evasion. The Senate asks us to increase the gross tonnage of dutiable imported vessels from 400 to 500 tons, and suggests an amendment which should meet the point of the honorable member for Ballarat, that it is not now clear that vessels which were ordered before 1st December, and provided it can be proved that the contract was signed before that date may come in free of duty. We decided that the duties should operate from 1st July next ; but the amendment requested by the Senate will enable such vessels as were ordered prior to the introduction of the schedule to come in free if imported within twelve months. To meet an objection raised by the honorable member for Coolgardie, the Senate requests us to allow the importation of pictures for cathedrals and churches free. I propose to ask the Committee to make all the requested amendments, with the exception df those relating to items 54 and 117. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will not agree to this. The manufacturers of these handkerchiefs have told us that they have enjoyed a high protective duty. I fail to understand why the Minister should have reduced the Protection to the extent that he did. These manufacturers placed their case before the Senate, which recognised the justice of their claim, and made a request that the rates be raised to those prevailing under the old Tariff. Those concerned state that if the duty be reduced they will be severely handicapped. They proceeded to erect a factory and to import machinery some time ago, in the belief that the old Tariff would be maintained. </para>

                    <para>. - The position was that handkerchiefs were dutiable at  40  per cent. and  35  per cent., according to the country of origin. Piece-goods for patterned handkerchiefs came in at the same rate of duty as did the finished article, and manufacturers had to pay  40  per cent. and  35  per cent. for their raw material, but the ordinary plain piece-goods came in free. It was urged by manufacturers that at least one-half of the handkerchiefs that are used are patterned, so that half of the material used by them was dutiable at the same rate as that relating to the finished article. I was a member of the deputation that waited on a former Minister of Customs with a view to securing an alteration of the duty on piece-goods in this respect; and I am going to vote every time, and to urge the Committee to vote with me, for a fair margin of Protection. I believe that the duties of  35  per cent. and  30  per cent. which are now proposed as a modification of the Senate's request, will more than represent the whole of the wages paid in this industry. We certainly ought not to impose rates of duty which would not only be, to a large extent, prohibitive, but would be equal to more than double the wages paid in the industry. I think that my proposal will give the local manufacturers a fair margin of Protection - greater in fact than that in respect of  90  per cent. of the articles dealt with in the Tariff as a whole. I hope that theCommittee will agree to our proposal. </para>

That preference is granted if 25 per cent. of the value of the article has been produced in Great Britain. The honorable member may rest assured that every care is taken by the Customs Department in regard to this matter. The Department has the reputation of always endeavouring to secure the highest rate of duty. That is a proper course for it to take, in order that there shall be no unfair discrimination. Under the item as it stands, there will be an increase on the rate of duty that was operative under the previous Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- Allowing from six weeks to two months for an order to reach the Old Country, it is quite possible that vessels ordered prior to December, 1910, have not yet been delivered. I am not objecting to the duty, but those who entered into contracts under free conditions should not be embarrassed. The Tariff has been rushed through rather hurriedly, but in the present temper of the Committee I can see that it is futile for me to press the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - In the early days of this Parliament it was arranged that members of the Ministry holding portfolios should not be allowed anything for expenses when travelling about the country on official business. At that time, of course; not much travelling was done, but it has become increasingly necessary, especially in recent years, for Ministers holding portfolios to pay official visits to various parts of the Commonwealth, often travelling great distances. In the opinion of the Government, the time has come when allowances ought to be given to Ministers when they are travelling on official business in the Commonwealth or its Territories. When the honorable member for Coolgardie and myself were delegates to the Premiers' Conference at Hobart some years ago, as representatives of the Commonwealth, we had to pay our own expenses. The same thing has occurred in other instances, and I wish to intimate to both Houses that the Government think it would be fair for the Prime Minister, while on official visits only, to be allowed 40s. per day, and other Ministers holding portfolios to be allowed 25s. per day when on similar visits. </para>

                        <para>- I am very loth to make this statement, but I know what has occurred in my own case, and in the cases of other Ministers. The Minister of one particular Department was travelling backwards and forwards on official business for no less than ninety days, at his own expense ; and, while no complaint is made, I believe that the people of the Commonwealth and the Parliament do not desire that state of affairs to continue. </para>

                        <para>- I said on purely official business. If Ministers went on party business, they would, of course, not draw any allowance. The Postmaster- General will have, for instance, to visit the wireless stations from time to time, and it is only fair and reasonable that his travelling expenses should be allowed. I think that the people expect that at least fair expenses should be paid in such circumstances. The Minister of External Affairs informs me that last year he was travelling on no less than 100 days upon purely official business. When I was in Opposition I urged the honorable member for Ballarat and his Ministers to take steps in this direction, because I believe it is the right one, and the matter has become much more acute as time has gone on. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to make a personal explanation. Last night, when speaking on the question of inrmigration, I stated that, according to Ministerial statements, there was a dearth of labour to carry out work in Government Departments, as well as in private avocations. I was challenged to show where any such announcement regarding public works had been made by a Minister in the House. I had in my mind at the time a statement regarding industries made by the Minister of Trade and Customs, but I was particularly referring to a speech by the ex- Postmaster- General. Last session, when the Estimates were before the House, the honorable member for Hunter and the honorable member for Parramatta urged that the votes should not be allowed to lapse. The honorable member for Parramatta desired the then Postmaster-General to push on more expeditiously with postal works, and the Minister, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Vol. LVI., page 2781, made the following reply : - </para>

                        <para>The Department is not altogether to blame for not being able to cany out more works; the fault lies primarily with the Parliament for not voting more money in the past, so that material, instead of being brought simply for specific works, could be obtained in large quantities. Then, again, there has been a great want of trained men in order to carry on the work. We can employ temporary hands for much of the work, but it is essential that the supervision should be in the hands of permanent officials responsible to the Department. </para>

I recognise that this statement by the Postmaster-General rather limits the area of employment. The unemployed problem referred to by the honorable member for Melbourne last night is a very difficult one; and I agree with Burns, who says that one of the saddest sights is a man in quest of work and unable to find it. We are a highly-civilized community, with a genius for legislations and I regret that the question of unemployment has not taken precedence of many measures on the statute-book of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is impossible. Portions of the report of the Postal Commission have been given effect to, and others ought to be given effect to ; but there are recommendations to which exception can be taken, or to which some qualification should be attached. This motion covers such a wide area, and affects so many people, that we ought not to deal with it in this offhand manner. It would be meaningless if carried, because it would not bind anybody, or have any effect. The case for the Postal Commission has been stated fully, and some criticism has been offered ; but it would be very unsatisfactory to pass the motion before honorable members have had an opportunity to discuss it. I suggest to the honorable member for Gwydir that it would be well to postpone the consideration of the matter. I am quite aware that he claims that certain of the recommendations have been given effect to without recognition ; but that fact speaks more for the report than any mere verbal indorsement in the House. I should not like to vote against the motion, but I cannot vote for it at the present stage. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the honorable member for Gwydir will not press this motion to a division now. A few weeks ago he made a lengthy - perhaps, rather too lengthy - statement in regard to it. Had he condensed his remarks and given us the benefit of his vast experience in postal matters, we might have been able to grip the situation more effectually. I should not like to take the responsibility of voting for this motion after so little discussion, nor should I like to vote against it. The reservation by the  Prime Minister may mean something, or it may mean nothing; and I hope that the honorable member for Gwydir will consent to a postponement. </para>

                            <para>.- I shall be disposed to fall in with that view in exactly three minutes' time. It will be remembered that this motion deals with the case of a man who lost £30 16s. 8d. through postal orders addressed to him being given to some other person. The Department admitted having lost the money, but the Commonwealth disclaims all responsibility. There are many cases throughout the Commonwealth in which people have really been robbed ; and there ought to be some system to protect those to whom money orders are sent. I submit that the following forms of declaration might be adopted - </para>

In his view, every leading article in a newspaper should be signed, and if effect is given to that view, it will herald a new era for journalists, whose names, now known only to their fellow newspaper men, will become household words in the mouths of the general public. Newspaper readers will then know who write the articles which meet with their approval. A column of the mighty <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> headed with the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr,. Donald</inline> McDonald, is keenly scanned by youths and boys, because they know that everything he writes is worth reading, and when that great genius, Frank Myers, wrote under the pen name of " Telemachus, " his articles excited so much curiosity that the people discovered his identity, and his name is now widely known. It is hard, however, that only the Himalayas of the journalistic world should be known to the public. </para>

He and myself have had a conversation, and the honorable member agrees that I never so expressed myself in the House. Knowing the hard life of the average journalist, and the difficult task he has in making both ends meet, I should be the last to so speak of him when he writes what he is told to write. </para>

My statement referred to the fact that a Vice-Consul of Russia had told me that an official of the Government of Queensland - I presume the officer in charge of immigration - had told him that the depots in Queensland were occupied by immigrants from Great Britain, and asked him to prevent any more immigrants from Siberia coming. That statement appeared in the newspapers, and was not denied by the Premier of Queensland. He was, however, reported to have stated that be had been asked on more than one occasion to subsidize Russian immigration, but that he was not prepared to do that, because the money he had in hand he was. devoting to British immigration. I find I never said that the Premier of Queensland personally made any statement to the Vice-Consul. The person I had in my mind at the time was some officer representing the Government of Queensland, such as the immigration officer. </para>

                <para>Happily we have come to the close of a rather strenuous session, and I wish, as the representative of the Government, to thank honorable members on both sides for the way in which they have attended to their duties, and the good temper that has prevailed. In the heat of political controversy most of us forget ourselves at times, but it stands to the record of the members of the National Parliament that they have ever carried out their public duties with fitting decorum, and in such a way as to prove themselves a credit to the people whom they have the honour to represent. I make that statement with some pleasure, not by way of contrast with other Parliaments, but simply to emphasize the fact that the standard of parliamentary procedure has happily, with very rare exceptions, been all that could be desired. The good feeling that has prevailed, and the good work that has been done since the inauguration of the Federal Parliament, has been greatly aided by the officers whom we have had to assist both sides in this House. We have been specially fortunate in the Presiding Officers, who have been called upon to protect the interests of every member, and to see that the procedure was carried on in regular order. You, sir, who have the privilege and honour of presiding over this branch of the Parliament, will agree with me when I say that you are ably assisted by the officers who serve under you. It is my duty now not only to offer you congratulations, but to include in that expression the officers who have so assiduously and capably carried out the duties allotted to them. I trust that this Parliament will long be favoured in the same way. I should like, on this, the first opportunity that I have had to speak in this connexion, to make special reference to a branch of the officers of Parliament who stand somewhat apart from the ordinary system. I refer to the gentlemen who compile the official reports of the debates and proceedings of this Parliament. . I do not hesitate to say that no other Parliament is so fortunate in this respect as we are, and I hope that all future Parliaments will be as fortunate, in the gentlemen who are engaged in making a true and faithful record of what is said and done in the two Chambers of this Legislature. I venture to say that I am speaking for every honorable member of this House, and indeed for the whole Parliament when I utter these words. </para>

                        <para>- They are gentlemen who do not intrude upon us in any way, save with the object of endeavouring to faithfully carry out the onerous and difficult duties that are cast upon them. I wish now to express regret at the absence, owing to illness, of the  Clerk  of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy.</inline> I shall convey to him the hope of honorable members that his enforced absence will lead to his speedy recovery and return to the duties of his office. Although an enormous amount of work has not been done this session, I think that that which we have accomplished, apart from controversial matters, will have far-reaching effects, and prove beneficial to Australia. I feel, above everything else, that the trend of Australian thought is in a truly national direction, and that what were previously little rivulets, each running in its own way, are now uniting. into: a great stream of thought, which must lead to the development of truly national ideals. Happily, we have of recent years enjoyed unexampled prosperity, and we hope that it will increase and continue. It will be the duty of this Parliament, as well as of the Parliaments of the States, to do all that can be done by legislation and administration to assist in the continuance of the prosperity as long as nature is bounteous, and to be watchful of the time when the seasons may be less propitious. I do not wish to trespass further on the kindness and consideration of the House, except to wish you, sir, honorable members, and the officers a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Honorable members will be called together next session earlier than in previous years - probably well before the end of the financial year - and I sincerely trust that they will return greatly invigorated as the result of the recess, and ready to perform their onerous duties in the best interests of Australia and the Mother Country, to whom we are proud to owe allegiance. </para>

                    <para>. - In the absence of the Leader of the Opposition, I take this opportunity, on behalf of honorable members on this side of the House, of joining in the felicitations of the Prime Minister upon the termination of the session. We have every reason to be pleased, if not thankful, that we have been able to get through our work in time to enable us to return to our respective homes before Christmas without the spectre of having to return immediately after the New Year holidays to our legislative duties. It is to be regretted that in the closing days of the session we have had to work at such high pressure, and during such long hours. Those, however, are but some of the incidents of parliamentary life which are entirely unavoidable. It seems to be the practice of Parliament to indulge in a fair amount of talking at the beginning of the session, and that necessarily contracts the opportunity for detailed work towards the close of the session. The Opposition has felt it to be its duty to oppose a considerable number of the proposals submitted by the Government during the session, but notwithstanding their opposition these have been carried. It is not for us at this time to criticise the work done. That work has passed into history, and it will be for the people, as the result of experience, to say whether or not a considerable proportion of that of which we disapproved has been as successful as its promoters hoped it would be. I join with the Prime Minister in congratulating you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> upon the termination of the session, and in' expressing appreciation of the efforts of the various officers of the House to assist irk the great work of preparing legislation. We certainly owe our thanks to the  Clerk  of the House and the  Clerk  Assistant. We particularly sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> iri the serious illness that has overtaken him,, and hope that at the beginning of next session he will be restored to health and find* his place once more at the Clerk's table. I desire to join with the Prime Minister in expressing unqualified admiration of the work .of our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. As an old shorthand writer and reporter, I feel justified in saying that I do not believe there is a shorthand staff in the world to excel our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff in accuracy, as well as in. general swiftness of execution. I often feel a sense of sorrow at the way in which the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff is overworked, especially during an all-night sitting, and of wonder that their powers of endurance should be so great as to enable them to see their labours through. We ought not to forget to recognise in some form the great ability of the Chief of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff,. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Friend,</inline> his courtesy and attention to honorable members from time to time, in drawing «their attention to little matters, and the splendid manner in which Hansard as a whole is edited and published. As to whether its voluminous pages, so well and splendidly reported, are adequately read, I am not at all sure. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that some future historian in wading through the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will occasionally come across some gem of political thought that will enable him to follow the trend of our legislation and the way in which we have legislated. As to the trend of our "legislation generally, I think that we ought in all our efforts to recognise the ideal of the Constitution, and not in any way to violate its fundamental principles or its general tendencies as outlined by the law and approved by the people. There must be differences of opinion as to the best and' most efficient methods for realizing our ideals, but both Ministerialists and Oppositionists are animated by the sincere desire to promote the true welfare of the country. It is a matter for congratulation that, although in the last as in previous sessions, we have strenuously fought for our political ideals, there has not been any appreciable display of enduring enmity. </para>

                    <para>. - I want on this, the last day of the session, to make my protest against the long hours which have to be worked by the splendid staff which reports our proceedings. When this House is not sitting, the Senate often sits, and the reporters, having finished their turns here, have to continue their labours in another place. At ordinary times the staff is not undermanned, but when the sittings of both Houses are prolonged, as on occasions like this, it is undermanned, and the work becomes very heavy. We must all indorse the encomium of the Prime Minister. I find that the policemen in the buildings, who are supposed to be on duty for only eight hours at a stretch, have to work longer on occasions like this. I hope that the Prime Minister will take the matter into his consideration, and see whether something can be done. to shorten the hours of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, of the staff attending in the refreshment rooms, and of the guardians of the law. The small Tariff Bill which we recently had under consideration provided merely for the rectification of anomalies, and was introduced chiefly to facilitate its administration, but it will be a great disappointment to me if a good Tariff is not placed before us next session. I hope that during the recess Ministers will take into consideration the advisability of introducing a really up-to-date Protectionist Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- As the sole representative of that party. We who sit in this corner nourish no feeling of resentment against Ministers. They were returned with a majority to carry out a certain policy, and we have no right to object to them doing so. At the last election, the people determined to give the Labour party a fair trial, an opportunity to demonstrate what it could do. The party is in an absolute majority in both Chambers, and it has had a fair trial during a period of more than eighteen months, but I am sure that the results have created regret in the minds of those who put it in power, because the trend of its legislation is not on the whole in the interests of the Commonwealth. We look forward to the coming session with a good deal of interest. Ministers have another twelve months in which to justify the people's choice. If, on the contrary, they trifle with the liberties of the people, and tamper with the finances, they will lose the confidence of the electors. I wish all and sundry, including the officers of the House, a right happy Christmas, and express, the hope that next session Parliament may be afforded the time to duly consider important measures, instead of having them forced through at the risk of health, and at the sacrifice of that good feeling incidental to long-continued sittings. </para>

                    <para>. - This matter has already been mentioned privately to me this morning by the honorable member for Melbourne. In the old Tariff, which was in operation until about three weeks ago, motor bodies were dutiable at 35 and 30 per cent. ; but when the Tariff went to another place, they were dutiable at <inline font-style="italic">£24.</inline> 10s. and <inline font-style="italic">£21,</inline> according to the country of origin, or 35 and 30 per cent., whichever were the higher rates of duty. The Senate requested that there should be three rates of duty, namely, single-seated bodies at£17 and£15, double-seated bodies at  £24 10s.  and  £21,  and bodies with fixed or movable canopy tops, such as the landaulette, the limousine, and taxi-cabs, and bodies, n.e.i, each,  £42  and  £36.  In the case of the lower-valued bodies the duty of  £24  ros. and  £21,  as agreed to by this House, would have meant  80  to  100  per cent., and, in some cases,  150  per cent. I am given to understand by the trade that the rates which have been fixed will more than equal an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of  35  and  30  per cent. So far as the higher-priced cars are concerned, the bodies of which are dutiable at  £42  and  £36,  the effect will be much the same as if the duty of  35  and  30  per cent, had remained. Motor bodies are valued up to  £150  or more, but the duty is based on the value at the port of shipment. Thus, a motor body worth  £100  when put on board, may, after paying freight, duty, and inland charges, be worth more than  £150  here; and the fixed rates will, I feel confident, give a greater amount of protection than the duties originally proposed. </para>

If my action in bringing this matter under the notice of the Queensland Premier has assisted to clear away some misconception, I shall not regret taking the step I did.

                    <para>A little while ago some Russians, who intended to go to Queensland, were apparently told that Queensland had no room for them at that moment. I then announced that if two of them would go to the Northern Territory to spy out the land, arrangements would be made to give them every facility to do so. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is not the only occasion on which this matter has been referred to; and, though the Minister may not have so intended, the impression conveyed was that there is some discrimination made between Russian and other immigrants. The Queensland Government spend, I think £70,000 annually in promoting immigration. The whole of that amount was absorbed last year, and the Government were compelled to refuse  700  odd applications to introduce nominated immigrants. The reason was not that Queensland did not desire the class of immigrants who offered, but the vote was exhausted, and it must be admitted that  £70,000  per annum is a substantial sum for a State like Queensland to spend in this direction. Now that the matter has been cleared up by the Minister of External Affairs, I have no wish to pursue it further. I sincerely thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> for the seasonable greetings that you have been kind enough to send us, and assure you that we reciprocate them most heartily.

I do not like to see Ministers get rusty, and that question is well calculated to occupy their spare moments with advantage to themselves and to the country. Do what we may, and fight as we may against it, something of the kind is inevitable in that great Department. I have no complaint to make, and never have had, as to the relations between our party and the Opposition, but never in my political career have I been insulted by one of my own party until this session. That sort of thing does not reflect much credit on those who are responsible for it. They may think it very clever to get into the press something that can be used against a comrade, but we should not forget our comradeship so far as to put on record things which honorable members must know will be faithfully recorded by those who are watching the interests of the other side. I make these observations, not so much in reply to the statement in question, as in reply to the publicity that has been given to it to my injury.  1  need scarcely add that the statement is untrue, and unworthy of any member of this Parliament. </para>

During the early part of this year there was a somewhat serious industrial trouble in North Queensland. It was generally termed a strike, but I wish to place on record the fact that it was not a strike. I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Concise Oxford Dictionary,</inline> from which I quote the following definition of a strike :  - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>It is clear that in order that an industrial disturbance may be properly described as a strike, men who are at work should knock off work unless their employer concedes some demand for shorter hours, higher wages, and so on.  The industrial trouble in North Queensland was therefore not a strike, because the men had not gone to work, and refused to go to work for the terms offered. There were some reasons for believing that during the currency of last season, and before the commencement of next season, fresh regulations would be issued by the Customs Department, laying down the conditions of work in the canefields. I have no authority for the statement, but I talked the matter over with the Minister of Trade and Customs, who said that he would take it into consideration, and I left him under the impression that the conditions would be better in the future than they have been. The industrial trouble resulted in the establishment of better conditions for the men in the mills, but these did not apply to the men in the fields. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he has given the matter further consideration, and has come to any determination in regard to making the conditions of labour in the canefields better for the -workers in the future than they have been in the past. </para>

I hope he will redeem his promise to carefully consider 'the matter of extending the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities of the residents of country districts. A? a representative of a country electorate, I felt that I could not permit the session to close without requesting the Postmaster - General to do something more than has been done in the past in the way of providing the people of country districts with facilities which might make all the difference between isolation and civilization. I should like to get a more definite statement from the Prime Minister as to the length of the approaching recess* I hope it will be brought to a close earlier than the end of June.

I wish now to express the opinion that the work of the session just concluded is work of which we have a right to be proud. Though' I notice that in a certain quarter it is spoken of as a poor record, I am satisfied that any unbiased person will admit that the session has been as fruitful as the first session of this Parliament. I hope our work will be attended with the best results to the people. If there be anything at which I think we might cavil in connexion with the work of this session, it is that our revision of the Tariff was not as extensive as it might have been. I appeal to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who no one will deny is a staunch Protectionist, to do what is possible to bring, about a more complete revision of the Tariff next year in keeping with, the requirements of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I have allowed ample discussion, and think that the Minister of Trade and Customs might furnish the replies privately.  I  should like to say to the Prime Minister, to the honorable member for Bendigo, and to others who have been so kind as to express their feelings concerning the officers of the House and myself, that we appreciate the remarks which have been made from all quarters. I can only say on behalf of the staff that since I have occupied my present position the whole of the officers have been exceedingly good. I have never had any cause to complain in any way whatever concerning the manner in which their duties have been discharged. The work has been done in a most satisfactory maimer, reflecting credit upon those who have been responsible for it, as well as upon Parliament generally. I wish to express my deep regret that the  Clerk  of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Gavan Duffy, was incapacitated by illness during the session. I saw him a few days ago, and am glad to say that he was able to assure me that his medical advisers bad stated that he was on the mend. It is probable that when the next session commences, we shall see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> in his place, and I hope that he will be in the best of health. I am extremely sorry that he has been so ill, and trust that the holiday which he is about to take will fully restore him to that full state of health which is so necessary to enable an officer of this House to carry out the work required of him. With regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, the  Clerk  Assistant, and others, they have all carried out their duties most admirably. I desire to thank them sincerely for the manner in which they have discharged their functions, and for assistance rendered to me in carrying out my own duties during the past session. The session that is just about to conclude has been the quietest and most peaceful one that I have known since I have been a member . of the Federal Parliament. I again thank honorable members most sincerely for the assistance they have given to mie, and on behalf of the officers and myself, I wish all a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year. </para>

                    <para>. - My honorable colleague the Minister of Trade and Customs, not being able' to speak again on this motion, has asked me to say in reply, to the question of the honorable member; for New England, that the Senate was no* able to deal with the matter to which he has referred, because it was not contained in the Bill. The question of the export of ores referred to by the honorable menu ber for Newcastle is still under consideration. A question was asked by the honorable member for Herbert with regard to the wages of sugar workers. . He regarded this as a matter of urgency.. The Government fee] that until the report of the Sugar Commission is received this question ought not to be dealt with'., The Royal Commission is taking very important evidence, and will furnish a report without delay, and there will . be no&gt; unnecessary delay in considering the ques* tion afterwards. The honorable member, for Melbourne asked a question regarding, the Tariff. That is a matter of Ministerial policy, but the present is hardly the time for dealing with' it. It will be considered. The question asked by the honorable member for Riverina regarding reciprocity between members of the State Parliaments and of the Commonwealth Parliament has been dealt with fully by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.,</inline> I understand that there are some defects in existing arrangements, but this Government desires to co-operate - in all SUCh matters in the promotion of reciprocity. The Government are anxious to work with the State Governments and State members of Parliament wherever possible. Of course we understand that rules have to be made by State Governments to guard their own properties. Subject to these rules, however, there ought to be full co-operation in regard to the matters that have been mentioned. As to the question raised by the honorable member for Macquarie, concerning the purchase Of material for wireless telegraphy, I wish to say, with the greatest respect for that honorable member and others, that I advise the exercise of a little patience on the subject. I venture to say that they will not regret it. The question raised by the honorable member for Indi has been dealt with. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports appeared to have something to say of considerable importance, but owing to present circumstances would not let us know what was on his mind. I again express my hearty thanks to honorable members, and my hope that all. of them will enjoy good health during the recess, and will return invigorated when the next session opens. I trust also that the Opposition will return in vigorous health, able to devote themselves earnestly to the criticism of our measures and policy. The safety of a country in regard to legislation and administration, whether under a Labour or any other Government, depends very largely on effective criticism. I express again my thanks to all who have helped us to make this not only a successful but a happy session. </para>
