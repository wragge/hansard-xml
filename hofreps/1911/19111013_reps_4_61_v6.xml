            <para class="block">Telegraph Operators&#39; Dissatisfaction - Dangerous Telegraph Poles - Commonwealth Postage Stamps. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FINLAYSON.</inline> - The information has reached me that considerable dissatisfaction is felt by the telegraph operators in the General Post Office at Brisbane, and it is stated in this morning&#39;s newspapers that a similar state of affairs prevails at Sydney, the trouble being due to a regulation issued by the Public Service Commissioner on the subject .of broken time. Has the matter come under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and, if so, will he cause such inquiries to be made as will satisfy the telegraphists that no unreasonable calls will be made on them in regard to hours? </para>

                    <para>- Some two years ago I drew attention to the very dangerous condition of some of the telegraph poles in and about Melbourne, and I think a direct question on the subject was asked by the honorable member for Melbourne. I should now like to know whether the Postmaster-General&#39;s attention has been drawn to the sad accidents to line repairers, and whether he is aware that some of the poles are in such a state that a stick or umbrella&#39; can be pushed into them? Does the Postmaster-General intend to have a full report on the subject, and to explain how it is that the poles have been allowed to remain in this state until repairers have met their death? </para>

                        <para>In January last, the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department was asked to extend to the other States of the Commonwealth the system obtaining in New South Wales of transmitting data from important country centres, and in August last ten additional rainfall stations were added to the list in Queensland. It was, however, intimated that owing to congestion of telegraph lines in dealing with ordinary business no greater extension of free use of the lines could be agreed to. The Meteorological Bureau is fully, seized of the importance of giving the greatest publicity to weather information, and is constantly seeking the aid of any likely means of distribution, but in view of the representations of the Postal Department, that it is not feasible at present to further use the telegraph lines, for meteorological purposes a satisfactory solution is difficult to arrive at. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department estimates the annual value of services carried out on behalf of the Meteorological Bureau at ^50,000. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to call attention to a matter which, though of comparatively minor importance, requires looking into. The clause means that if it is not necessary throughout the great length of line to fence every part the Minister need not do so. In the State Acts, however, provision is made for protecting the public by making level crossings, and so forth ; and we should not construct this line without reserving to the public all the rights they have under State legislation. Section 18 of the Northern Territory Act 19 10, which, of course, is not applicable to Western Australia, contains a provision that the Commonwealth, in the &#34;construction, maintenance, and working &#34; of any railway required or authorized by the Act in South Australia shall be bound by the Railway Construction Acts of the State and the laws relating to State railways to the same extent as the State is so bound. I notice that by some oversight the word &#34;maintenance&#34; is left out of this Bill, and that the word &#34; construction &#34; is not defined so as to include maintenance. &#39; Until we alter the law we are, so far as South Australia is concerned, subject to all the liabilities imposed on the Railway Commissioners of that State, and those liabilities include the provision of level crossings for stock, and so forth. I do not wish to move an amendment, because that might embarrass the Government, but merely draw attention to the matter so that it may be considered. </para>

                    <para>.- What is the meaning and object of the clause? It appears merely to indicate that the Minister may purchase or acquire certain kinds of mechanical power in connexion with the construction and working of the line. If it means no more than that, I am at a loss to understand why the clause is here. The other night the Prime Minister attempted to cast ridicule on an amendment providing for the weight of rails ; and it was at the same time suggested that the gradients and curves should be stated in the Bill. Such matters, to my mind, are much more important than the fencing ; in any case, we might take it for granted that the Minister will utilize engines, practically of any kind. Does the clause mean that when a particular engine is wanted the Minister will not proceed to construct it, but purchase it in the usual way ? </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Perth is, I think, entitled to an answer. If a public body desires to run an engine from which sparks may cause damage, it is necessary to obtain a general power to do so. Is this only a sort of skeleton Bill merely to adopt the policy of the construction of a line, or is it intended&#39; to be a complete Bill? &#39; A great many accidents may be sustained by the public on railways ; and I should like some assurance that the Minister will see that the rights of the public and of the Commonwealth are properly safeguarded. In the Railways Acts of the States, rights and duties are completely defined; and this, as we know, is the result of long experience. The honorable member for Angas has mentioned that we considered these points in connexion with the negotiations for the transfer of the Northern Territory. In the Act providing for the transfer, in section 18, we declared that the laws of South Australia in relation to all these subjects should be binding on the Commonwealth. This provides for the one section in South Australia, the remaining section should be as completely provided for. This is a technical subject, and it would, therefore, be unreasonable to expect the Minister to give us off-hand an authoritative answer ; but I should like to have from him an assurance that he will consult his advisers, and that, if necessary, such action will be taken in the Senate as will duly safeguard the interests of both the Commonwealth and the people generally. </para>

It might be urged in the Law Courts that we had no authority to use that kind of mechanism. We have already taken the very best legal advice available in the Department, but if anything further is necessary the Bill can easily be amended. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the Minister has said, in  reply to the honorable member for Darling Downs, that, if necessary, a further Act will be passed, and a measure will certainly have to be passed eventually on the lines of the South Australian Railway Commissioners Act in order to give the powers to which reference has been made. A subsequent clause of this Bill, however, covers a good deal of the matters to which attention has been called. </para>

                        <para>- I feel my responsibility to the country in regard to the expenditure of public funds, and desire, as far as possible, to safeguard the people against extravagance. The Minister will have power under this clause to do almost anything, and the Consolidated Revenue will be charged with the cost of all his adventures. I suggest to the honorable gentleman that, before we reach the third- reading stage, some step should be taken to safeguard the Commonwealth against possible contingencies in this direction. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that items to provide for the building of a railway will be included from time to time in the Estimates, so that when those Estimates are submitted, a discussion can take place on points such as those mentioned by the honorable member for Wentworth. It would be ridiculous to so limit the wording of this clause as to make it possible for the work to be suddenly held up - perhaps whilst Parliament was in recess - owing to the Minister having insufficient power to deal with some trifling matter that was not specifically mentioned in the Act. To my mind, the only possible way of providing for such a great work as this is to give the Minister practically unlimited power as to details. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly think, more particularly as, I believe, it is the intention of the Government to construct this railway by day labour, that, before we finally give the Minister these wide and varied powers, and also vote the whole of the money necessary for the work, we should, at least, have from him an assurance as to the manner in which he is going to spend the money. There is a great deal in the point raised the other day by the honorable member for Perth, at the request of the honorable member for Fremantle, in regard to the weight of rails to be used. There is a possibility of our wasting a great deal of money by adopting too light a type of rail. The maintenance of this line is going to be&#39; a very heavy burden. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Richmond need not be apprehensive as to the effect of the adoption of day labour in the construction of the line. In Victoria lines are being constructed now on the day-labour principle far cheaper than used to be the case under the contract system, and I believe that this is also true of New South Wales. The contractors&#39; profits are being cut out, and the Governments of the day and the workers themselves are obtaining the benefits which the contractors at one time used to secure. It is perfectly right that the Committee should make every possible inquiry as to how far the Minister intends to go in exercising the great powers conferred by the measure. I hope the Government will adopt in the construction of the line the day-labour system, which is being employed in the States, and thereby save considerable sums to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not regard this clause as the final word in connexion with the management of the railway. The Minister must have large powers conceded to him at the present stage. Later on, when the line is working, probably the preponderance of feeling in the House and amongst the people will be in favour of the appointment of a Commission to manage the railway. Until then it would hamper the Minister if we gave him anything short of the powers conceded in the Bill, even though some honorable members may regard them as a little dangerous. In the New South Wales Parliament, as far as I know, the most that has ever been submitted in regard to the construction of a new line is the plan of the route and the recommendation of the Public Works Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - The weight of rail is a matter upon which the engineers are so thoroughly agreed that no difficulty need be apprehended. The engineers will be able to determine the weight of rail required for the class of traffic on this line. I do not think that there will be found to be any variation between the views of any of the railway engineers of Australia on the point. As to the question of maintenance, the traffic will be comparatively light for some time to come. The line will have to be cut up into lengths convenient for patrol and inspection by men stationed at different points, and no man will have a greater length to look after than he can cover on his tricycle in a day. That will be sufficient for some time to come, and so the maintenance will be placed upon a certain minimum basis. As the traffic increases, the line will have to be more heavily ballasted, and the number of men spread along the route will have to be increased. I do not think that in the early days of the line the question of the poundage of rail will have any material effect on the cost of maintenance. </para>

                    <para>.- I am surprised at honorable members opposite &#34; stone- walling &#34; the measure. The amendment to specify the weight of rail was lost, and therefore the dissertation of the honorable member for Cook was unnecessary. The question of the maintenance of the line is a matter for officialdom after the work of construction is completed. Honorable members opposite are hampering the Minister and &#34; stonewalling &#34; the measure by indulging in absolutely unnecessary talk. I do not believe in wasting the time of the country. Ministerial supporters seem to be determined not to allow the measure to proceed any further in Committee. There is nothing contentious in the Bill until we reach clause  18.  Why not let the intervening clauses pass, as they are all a matter of- form? The Bill has been drafted by men who know more about the subject than do honorable members opposite, and in the orthodox manner in which all railway construction Bills are drafted. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for. North Sydney has hardly done justice to the honorable member for Cook and others opposite. It is true that the measure is somewhat peaceful down to clause  15,  but the present is a time of extreme crisis, and it is necessary for grave national reasons that honorable members opposite should show themselves active in the supervision of public business. Those gentlemen are now facing a crisis in their careers. Any one of them may be chosen, and it is only right that the most exhaustive criticisms of public measures should at this stage emanate from them. I can see no other reason why they should make such earnest bids at this juncture. As one who is anxious to see the course of this measure made easy and placid, my sympathies are entirely with the honorable member for North Sydney, but as a humanitarian and one who realizes how intolerable it is to repress an overweening ambition, my sympathies go out to my honorable friends opposite. </para>

The powers and authorities taken ought to be limited to those existing at the date of the passing of this measure. We do not know what the existing powers are, and the State Parliament may add to them from time to time. The Northern Territory Acceptance Act provided for the assumption of the powers as existing at the date of the agreement. I suggest that the clause be amended by inserting after the word &#34; authorities, &#34; the words &#34; at the date of the passing of this Act.&#34; </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for &#39;Gippsland is quite right in saying that in the Northern Territory Agreement Act the powers assumed were limited to those existing at the date of the- agreement, but to allay anxiety I may state that, as draftsman of the South Australian Bill, I went through every section of the South Australian legislation that could affect our powers, and, with the representative of the Commonwealth, compared them in Melbourne. He was satisfied at that date that the taking over of the powers as they existed then would involve no harm or risk. I do not think any change has taken place since, but if there is any obnoxious difference we can amend the Act. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister might reasonably tell the Committee what are the powers and authorities vested in the South Australian Government. The next clause hands over the powers and authorities vested in the Western Australian Government. The Committee ought to know whether they are the same in both States. It might be more convenient to take over equal powers in both cases, so that our officers when passing over the border may know exactly how far their authority extends. Otherwise there may be all sorts of legal difficulties between State and State, in connexion with an inter-State line such as this undoubtedly is. Clauses 10 and 11 may be found to be in conflict. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that until the Commonwealth has a general- Railway Act similar to the State Acts, it will be necessary to have clauses like this in its construction Acts. No doubt we shall have a general Act before very long. In the meanwhile, the point raised by the honorable member for Gippsland deserves the serious consideration of the Government. Not only does the clause confer on the Minister all the powers given to the Minister of Railways of South Australia under existing Acts, but also all the powers that may be given to him under Acts which may be passed after this measure becomes law. That means that South Australia will be in a position to determine the conditions under which this railway shall be constructed and maintained. In framing the Bill, the departmental officers had access to the existing legislation of South Australia, and were able to make themselves acquainted with its effect, but they did not know what the future legislation of the State may be. Members, too, can inform themselves of the existing South Australian law, and may be quite willing to adopt it, but they are in the dark as to the future legislation of the State, which might be quite contrary to their view of what is proper for the Commonwealth. Perhaps the Minister will have the matter looked into, and, if necessary, provide for the amendment of the clause when the Bill is before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause empowers the Minister to make bylaws for the regulation, government, protection, and working of the railways. In the State Acts such by-laws are subject to the control of Parliament. In the South Australian Act of 1887, with which I am fairly familiar, because I drafted it, provision is made that fares may be fixed by by-laws. There is a series of provisions regarding regulations, and both by-laws and regulations are subject to Parliamentary control ; in other words, Parliament may, after they have been laid on the table, disallow them on the presentation of an address to the Government. I think that we should provide for similar Parliamentary control. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to support the amendment, because, as I say, in postal, military, and other matters the regulations are submitted so that parliamentary authority may be given or withheld. The working of the railways will include employment and conditions of labour, and without some such proviso as that proposed the Minister could work the whole business at his own sweet will. The amendment is not aimed at the present Minister or Government, but is absolutely necessary in any Bill of the kind. Personally I think the matter must have been overlooked, seeing that it is only a proper protection of the rights of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Does that not apply now under the Acts Interpretation Act? This House controls the purse, and if we passed a resolution declaring that a particular charge was bad, we should expect another place to have no say in the matter. There is, of course, the inconvenience of allowing another House to disallow what we are doing, but a special amendment might be drafted to cover that, if the Minister thinks proper. At present I suggest that we pass the amendment ; and we might recast the whole provisions in this respect, so as to preserve the supremacy of this House, giving power to another place, subject to our check, to make suggestions. </para>

Without such a clause it would be necessary for the Government to introduce a Railway Bill to govern the -whole matter of the railways as we were nearing the completion of the construction, whereas, with the clause we are inserting in a purely construction measure, we should have a provision regarding rates and so forth, which ought really to be in such a general Bill as I have suggested. The power given by the clause will not be required until the line is practically constructed. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think there is any danger in the point raised by the honorable member for Perth as to through rates. We have already given to the Minister all the powers possessed and exercised by the Railways Commissioners of South Australia and Western Australia, so that there will be no difficulty in arriving at an agreement as to through fares. This clause, in my opinion, is very desirable, though it seems to me that the Bill is very strangely drafted. For that, however, I do not blame the Government so much, because many things have te be provided for in this Bill which would be more properly provided for in a general Bill creating some authority for the construction, maintenance, working - for, indeed, the whole of the business connected with the line. A week ago the Government informed us that they did not think it desirable at present to create such an authority, because they were anxious to push on with this construction Bill. Until, however, the time arrives when a general Bill is necessary, we are bound to have a clause of this character in the present Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That is possible, but surely it is much more likely that a representative of the Commonwealth Clothing Factory will travel free over the Government railway ! Apart from such trifles as have been suggested, the necessity for such a provision cannot arise until the line is practically completed or close upon completion. I admit there is some necessity for a clause of the kind, and the case might be met if the Minister assured us that a general railway Bill will be submitted next session. </para>

                        <para>- It gives us no control, for never yet have honorable members had any practical chance of ventilating the question of regulations in this House. It is only when grave differences arise between parties that we have an opportunity to ventilate matters in the House. A matter may be of importance to a particular member, but not to a party as a whole, and in such circumstances it cannot be threshed out. This clause provides that a schedule of fares and rates made by the Minister shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within thirty days after the making thereof, if Parliament is then sitting, and if it is not sitting, within thirty days after the next meeting of the Parliament ; so that the schedule prepared by the Minister might be six or eight months old before we had a chance to deal with it. </para>

                    <para>. - As to the point raised by the honorable member for Perth regarding the power of the Minister to make a through rate, I do not think that the clause as it stands would enable him to do so. I trust that the honorable member for Angas will not insist upon his amendment to incorporate in the Bill section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904. That section provides that where an Act .confers power to make regulations, all regulations made accordingly shall be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,-</inline> that they shall take effect from the date of notification ; that they shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament ; and that -  if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after such regulations have been laid before such House disallowing any regulation such regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. </para>

The position would he that the Senate would have a power over the finances to which it is not entitled. </para>

It is for the Minister to say whether or not he is prepared to accept .the amendment ; but I trust that he will at least so limit it as to retain for this House the power to control rates and fares, instead of conferring on either House the power to disallow a decision of the Government in relation thereto. </para>

                    <para>.- It is very desirable that this clause should remain in the Bill. The honorable member for Wentworth said that whilst the line was being constructed nothing would be carried over it. He is evidently not aware of the fact that sheep and other stations extend for hundreds of miles over the country to be traversed, and that freight would be carried for them. Then, again, who knows what discoveries may be made during the construction of the railway? The line will pass through the Tarcoola gold-field, and it will carry everything required for that and other gold-fields that may be discovered. Whilst the railway from Southern Cross to Kalgoorlie was being constructed, the traffic upon it increased to such an extent that something like six engines were required to cope with it, apart altogether from the power required to haul the material for construction  purposes. The Minister must have full power to make these rates, and to vary them according to circumstances. In the event of a serious drought, sheep and cattle Would have to be removed from one place to another, and the Minister should be given power so to alter rates as to be able promptly to meet such an emergency. </para>

                        <para>- From the point of view of Parliamentary control, this is an exceedingly important matter. Under the amendment, both Houses would, if necessary, have the right tq protest against the schedule of rates and fares adopted by the Minister, so that we are simply asking for the preservation of Parliamentary control. With one exception, I do not think that any regulation framed by a responsible Minister, acting under proper advice, has ever been disallowed by either House of the Commonwealth Parliament. The exception referred to was a regulation framed by the present Minister of Home Affairs in regard to the collection of the census, and which was rejected by the Senate. We should be very careful not to give up our&#39; Parliamentary control, and I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The legislation of South Australia is generally noted for its preservation of the rights of the State Parliament. In section 37 of the South Australian Act power is given to the Commissioner to make by-laws fixing the amount of fares for the conveyance of passengers and the charges for the carriage of animals, goods, and parcels. It provides further, however, that such by-laws shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days of their making, and that if an address be presented to the Governor by either House they may be annulled. That is what we are asking for. We are asking, not for the introduction of any revolutionary principle, but for the recognition of an existing system. When the definition clause was under consideration, I asked the Minister of Home Affairs whether the rates and fares fixed by the Minister should not be submitted to Parliament, and the honorable gentleman, acting on his first impulses, which are generally Hie impulses cf statesmanship, said - &#34;I have not the slightest objection to doing that when the occasion arises.&#34; </para>

We want to remove, not the Minister himself, but that which is objectionable in any schedule or regulation. The amendment should be accepted. If, upon further consideration, it was thought to be too drastic, it could be reconsidered. The Minister could ask the Parliamentary Draftsman to consider how it harmonized with the whole scheme of his Bill. It would be much better for the Minister to accept the amendment than to reject it, . and be compelled at a later stage to ask for the recommittal of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The proviso to this clause that these schedules of fares and rates shall be laid on the table of the House is absolutely insufficient to meet the position. Under it schedules would be laid on the table, and we should have power to look at them., but we could not cause them to be disallowed unless we carried a motion that would be tantamount to a motion of censure. On such a. motion the matter would be decided on party lines, quite irrespective of the merits of the schedule itself. I recognise the force of the objection raised to the amendment, that it would give the Senate co-equal power with this House to veto a schedule of rates and fares; but we could add words providing for all that the honorable member for Angas has in view without going so far as to incorporate in this measure the provisions of section  10  of the Acts Interpretation Act of  1904.  I would suggest that the following words be added to sub-clause  2 : - </para>

I will give notice of intention to move to add to sub-clause  2  a proviso that &#34; the House of Representatives may within fifteen days after the tabling of the schedule by resolution vary all or any portion of it.&#34; It would not be proper to give any Minister unlimited power over so important a matter. The power that I am asking for is conserved to all the State Parliaments, and it is absolutely necessary when we are commencing a Commonwealth railway policy to preserve similar powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- The objection to the suggestion of the honorable member for Cook is that under it one House may veto a regulation which is sanctioned by the other. In a case of that kind the remedy would lie in the introduction and passage of an Act, and we should reach then exactly the same position as we are in now. The honorable member for Cook objects that when the schedules are laid before both Houses members can do nothing but look at them. Our remedy is exactly the same as we should have in the last resort if the amendment of the honorable member for Angas were adopted - namely, that we should have to deal with the matter by passing an Act. In the event of a clash of opinions between the two Houses, the matter has to be dealt with in the proper way by the introduction of  a  measure. </para>

An Act of Parliament has nothing to do with it, because an Act immediately tempts the Senate to interfere. They have a perfect right under the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> intervene by resolution. I would prefer that they did not have the same power as we have over these things, but if we do not allow them to do it by resolution, and a deadlock results, we cannot get over the difficulty by an Act, because they will simply refuse to pass the Act. In the South Australian Railways Act, as the honorable member for Darling Downs pointed out, there is an express provision on the lines of my amendment. All fares must be laid on the table of the House, and may be disallowed by the specific resolution of either House. We have based our Constitution on the South Australian practice, and the Senate holds in the matter of finance exactly the same relation to this House as the South Australian Legislative Council holds to the South Australian House of Assembly. </para>

I do not want to block a Bill about which I am not very enthusiastic, and therefore I would advise honorable members to follow the course laid down in 1904, and not to precipitate a dispute with the Senate about a measure which they are particularly anxious to pass. If the Minister thinks it better, after consultation with the Drafting Department, to throw both these clauses into some other shape, I am sure the Committee will facilitate the re-draft in every way, but at present, following what has been done in South Australia in a perfectly analogous case, his best course is to adopt my amendment. Without it this House will have no check over the charges at all. </para>

                    <para>.- After hearing the honorable member for Angas I am prepared to vote for his amendment. Whilst my proposal would perhaps establish the supremacy of the House of Representatives in a financial matter of this kind, it might raise in the Senate some difficulty that would be really to the detriment of the measure. Rather than that should happen, I would prefer the amendment of the honorable member for Angas. I am absolutely strong on the point that unlimited power should not be given to any Minister, Labour or Conservative, to fix rates and fares. Parliament must retain authority to review the matter. </para>

The matter of rates and fares mav be of great importance, but the members of a party may not feel inclined to turn the whole Government out on it.  I  want to see provision made in the measure for Parliament to deal with the question as a non-party one. The only way to secure that is to direct that the schedule shall be laid on the table, and that Parliament shall have an opportunity of vetoing or varying it within a certain period, just as is now done in the case of regulations in connexion with all the Government Departments. </para>

                    <para>. - All that we ask is that these by-laws shall be deemed to be regulations within the meaning of the Acts Interpretation Act of 1904, which provides that, wherever the word &#34;regulation&#34; is mentioned in an Act of Parliament the following procedure shall apply : The regulations have to be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> they take effect from the date of the notification, and they are to be laid before both Houses of Parliament within thirty days of their making, or if Parliament is not then sitting, within thirty days after its next meeting, but that, if either House at any time within fifteen sitting days after the regulations have been laid before the House pass a resolution of which notice has been given, disallowing any regulation, such regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. That applies to every regulation made where the power to make regulations is conferred by ah Act. All that we ask in this instance - the Minister has already accepted it as regards the general by-laws in a previous clause - is that as regards railway rates and fares the by-laws shall be deemed to be regulations. Then those provisions relating to regulations will apply. The effect will be that the regulations will have the force of law, unless within fifteen days of their being laid before Parliament either House passes a resolution disagreeing to them. </para>

He can fix what rates he pleases, and lay them on the table, but Parliament cannot disallow them. The regulations fixing the fees in the Patents and Trade-marks Departments have to be laid on the table, and the same practice should be adopted in this case. </para>

                    <para>.- It would be wise to give the Committee an opportunity to think over the amendment which I proposed. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether .the Senate should have the power to disallow regulations, but I am. afraid that if any limitation on its power is inserted it will not be agreed to. I should like Ministers to consider my proposal, and if they decide not to accept it, to give an opportunity to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to it. </para>

                    <para>, - Will the Minister give us an explanation of this clause ? It allows him to appoint all such officers as he thinks necessary for the construction or the working of the railway, and to authorize the employment of any person for these purposes. Similar provisions were inserted in the draft Census and Statistics Bill and the draft Meteorological Bill, but were withdrawn because the Public Service Act regulates the appointment of officers. Under the Bill as it stands, the Minister could enter into a life contract in appointing an officer. There is no restriction on his power of appointment. This appears to conflict with the principle of the Public Service appointments laid down in the Act. In the appointment of permanent engineers, for example, the usual practice should be followed. An office should be created, the vacancy advertised, all candidates should be tested, and the applicants best fitted should be appointed. So, too, with accountants, clerks, and the like. As for temporary hands, their appointment, again, is provided for in the Public Service Act, and provision is made for waiving its limitations, if necessary. It must be remembered that persons appointed under .the Act have their rights and privileges. But the Bill would, apparently, enable the creation of a new Public Service without defined status. </para>

                    <para>. - The Bill provides purely for the construction of the railway, but passengers and goods will be carried on the line before it is handed over by the constructing authority to the managing authority. It is not intended to create a large permanent staff, because it may be that the Commonwealth will not undertake another work of this kind for some time, and may not need again the men employed on it. If the Public Service Commissioner had to be consulted about the dismissal of one man, or the choice of another, it would hamper operations very much. Such procedure would be very unbusinesslike. The Engineer-in-Chief will be responsible to the Minister, but in turn will control his immediate officers, who will direct those below again. </para>

                    <para>. - There is no need for the clause, and I hope that the Minister will consent to its being negatived. The Public Service Act leaves to the Minister the right to appoint temporary hands without reference to the Commissioner. We know that as soon as the line is connected with a centre of population, passengers and goods will be carried on it, and a staff will be necessary to manage the traffic. A traffic inspector would not be appointed merely to control the traffic during the time that the line was under construction, to be dismissed on its completion. When the work nears completion, a traffic branch and a permanent way branch will .be just as necessary as later on, when it is in full running order. The best men available should therefore be appointed in the first instance, and in their appointment the provisions of the Public Service Act should apply. The temporary hands needed only for the construction of the work can be appointed without reference to the Public Service Commissioner. Temporary hands are so employed now in connexion with telegraph repairing, the construction of roads, and other works. If the clause is carried as it stands, there may ultimately be a serious conflict between the Minister and the Public Service Commissioner, unless men are temporarily appointed to what will be really permanent positions. The only result can be direct and serious conflict between the Minister in charge of what may be called temporary works and the. Public Service Commissioner, who, until the Act is repealed, must have control of the permanent appointments. Under the Public Service Act the heads of the Departments who represent the Minister have full and complete power to make all temporary appointments, and I do not think it advisable that a Minister should make permanent appointments so long as the Public Service Commissioner is vested with the authority. This clause will not give the Minister any more power than he possesses now, nor will it take from the Commissioner any of the authority he now has. It has been found necessary to withdraw similar clauses in two or three Supply Bills previously before us, and any conflict between the Construction Department and the Commissioner can be to the interests of neither the service nor the Minister. </para>

Recommendations made by those in charge in relation to wages and conditions, or the qualifications of persons employed, may be &#34; turned down &#34; by the Commissioner, who has absolutely no responsibility whatever in the conduct of the Departments. I know of instances where the Commissioner has taken up an attitude in entire opposition to the official charged by this Parliament and Government with the successful conduct of work of a highly technical and professional character. That being so, the sooner Parliament gets rid of the rotten idea that the Commissioner should be enabled to veto the recommendations of responsible officials the better. </para>

                        <para>- A little while ago, when the question of a minimum wage was before us, the then Minister practically insulted me on the floor of Parliament when I asked for a rate of 7s. ; and I desire this matter of wages to be placed beyond the power of any Minister. In the Railway Departments of the various States, from nine to twelve hours a day are being worked regularly, and when we ask that an eight hours&#39; day shall be provided for, we are told by the Commissioners that because there are 30,000 men employed - as in New South Wales - the reform will cost ,&#163;150,000 or &#163;250,000. The Commissioners express their sympathy with the idea of an eight hours&#39; day a minimum wage, and one day&#39;s rest in seven ; but when it is suggested that a reform, to which I am sure the public would readily assent, should .be carried out, we are told that the extra cost would throw the finances of the State Departments into chaos. </para>

                        <para>- I candidly admit that it is my desire to do so in the case of the railways. If we lay down, at a commencement, that the week&#39;s work shall consist of 48 hours, we shall have no trouble in the future. As the honorable member for Franklin has pointed out, this railway will be built in sections, and doubtless each section as completed will be worked. Men will be required for the permanent way, locomotives, and so forth, and they may in the beginning be permanently appointed. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; I have a great objection to temporary appointments for permanent work. However, that point need not be discussed at length just now., We have an opportunity now, at the commencement of the work, when few practical difficulties present themselves, to lay down the maximum working hours, and the minimum wage, though, of course, I have not provided for eight hours each day, as the exigencies of the traffic may require broken time. A minimum of 8s. a day has been laid down by the Minister for permanent work in his Department. </para>

                        <para>- Thousands were working for less than 7s., but I am glad to see that the latest Wages Board has fixed the minimum rate for unskilled labour at 8s. for eight hours. Unhappily, in some of the States, there are men working for as low a wage as 6s. and 7s. a day of eight hours ; and, while we should like to see the rate a little higher than I have suggested, it is well to lay down a minimum. I hope the principle will be affirmed in an Act of Parliament, because that will not only do good in the Commonwealth service, but will have a wholesome effect on the various services of the various States. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Cook, just before we adjourned for dinner, expressed pleasure that the appointments under this clause would not come under the operation of the Public Service Act. I wish to point out, however, that many of these appointments will in their very nature be of a permanent character. Probably before we have completed this railway other railways in the Northern Territory will be projected, and many of these appointments, if made, will go on automatically for a very long time. I am not speaking of casual labourers, because under the Public Service Act there is ample power to employ all the casual labour that will be required for the actual construction of the line. I am speaking rather of appointments to the engineering, construction, and clerical staffs, which will be, to all intents and purposes, of a permanent character. </para>

                        <para>- However short may be the limitation that the Prime Minister proposes to impose upon them, should not these employed automatically come under some form of control that is removed from political influence? I understand that the policy of this Parliament from the first has been to take the permanent employes of the Commonwealth out of Ministerial control, and to place them under an independent control where they are free from political interference and political interests. Officers engaged in the construction of this line will automatically be transferred to the other works to which I have referred, and there ought to be some definite provision that the officers whom the Minister may appoint under this clause shall be placed under the operation of the Public Service Act, or a Bill should be passed providing for their control by Railway Commissioners. If that is not done, the door will be opened wide to political influence. From the point of view of honorable members on all sides of the House, it it undesirable that our Public Service should be exposed to political patronage. I should like to know exactly the nature of the limitation which the Prime Minister proposes to impose. </para>

                        <para>- I believe it will be necessary to make permanent appointments prior to the completion of the line. I presume that in connexion with the appointment of the chief officials required either for the construction of the line or the supervision of the railway, applications will be publicly invited - that we shall follow the course pursued in connexion with the recent appointment of a Land Tax Commissioner and an Engineer for the Northern Territory. That should get over the difficulty raised by the honorable member for Darling Downs, who said that in order to remove this matter wholly beyond Ministerial control the appointment of officers should be placed under the Public Service Commissioner. I am not arguing for that, but I do urge that when it is proposed to make permanent appointments to the engineering and other staffs, applications should be publicly invited by advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> and the public press, and that those applications should be dealt with in the ordinary way. It is not yet clear whether or not permanent appointments are to be made during the construction of this line. </para>

That being so, it will be absolutely necessary to appoint permanent officials before the whole line has been constructed. </para>

That will prevent Ministerial patronage in the case of appointments that will extend six months beyond the time taken for the construction of the railway.

Appointments of a permanent character may then be made either by the Public Service Commissioner or some other authority, but no appointments made by the Minister or the Ministry will give the person appointed any position of permanency beyond six months after the construction of the Une. That is the extreme limit; but from the first day or the first month other machinery, to be brought into existence, will enable men who have shown their competency by passing prescribed examinations and so forth to become permanent officers of the Commonwealth railway service. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill is merely a construction Bill, and had better be left as it is. The Government have stated that as soon as they are able they will bring in a Bill to deal with Commonwealth railway management generally. Until then it would be better to give the Minister control without any of these limitations. &#39; The honorable member for Cook wanted to put other matters into the Bill, but he should make those proposals when the subsequent measure is brought forward. The men who will be employed in the construction of the line will be very different from those who will be afterwards employed in the management of traffic on the railway. After the opening those employed will be servants of the Commonwealth just like the employes in the existing Departments. </para>

The draftsman prepared it as a Bill for railway construction only, and honorable members should leave all their ideals regarding railway management until the Railway Management Bill is introduced later this session, or next session.

                    <para>.- I pointed out earlier that no plans of any sort had been submitted in connexion with the line. I find from the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that in the Queensland Parliament, not only plans, but even the sections of the line and books of reference are drawn out and submitted. The whole question is then referred to a Select Committee, and until the report of the Committee is finally adopted by the Parliament the line is not proceeded with. This Bill is not merely a construction Bill as argued by the honorable member for East Sydney. It is a construction and working Bill, and it even appropriates all the money that may be required for the construction of the line. </para>

                    <para>.- What the honorable member for Richmond has urged is rather important, and the Minister might make a statement as to whether it is the intention of the Government in constructing the line to follow the practice which has hitherto been observed in Queensland. It is a sound practice requiring plans, sections, and books of reference to be placed on the table of the House, so that the whole scheme may be open for discussion. This clause seems to contemplate the existence of such a practice, because it provides that it shall not be necessary to deposit with any State authority books of reference or plans in connexion with the railway. That is right, because it is our railway, and not a State railway. The Bill simply states that a railway line is to run according to the schedule. We know nothing about the details or plans. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that. It sweeps away most of the difficulties, although it will involve some alteration in clause 19. If the Prime Minister makes that promise, and the general character of an Appropriation Act is taken away from the measure so that special appropriations will be required, it will be rather a mistake to tie our hands or the hands of the Government in this Bill as to the character of the information which we shall require at the time. </para>

                    <para>.- Like the honorable member for Parramatta, I scarcely see the necessity for the proposed new clause. It has been accepted by the Prime Minister, but I am very much afraid that if it be passed the maximum of forty-eight hours will become the minimum, while we know that in some trades, which will be employed in the construction of the line, the rule is forty-four hours per week. It is quite possible that the engineers in charge may take this clause as an instruction to make the number of hours forty-eight; and, therefore, I think it would be better to leave the matter to those responsible for the work. As to the wages, if I were moving for a minimum, I should say that it should not be less than 10s. I have had some experience of Western Australia, and I know that in the part of the country through which the line will run, men cannot be obtained for less than 11s. per day. Here, again, however, the officers in charge may take the new clause as a direction to make the pay 8s. If the matter be left to the Minister and others in charge, we shall have better work and less trouble. </para>

                        <para>- There will be permanent hands employed on the railway ; at any rate, I take it that the unionists will be pretty well permanent. At Canberra, where there is, perhaps, the most salubrious climate in Australia, with all the conveniences and luxuries of life - wattles in full bloom, as shown on the advertising poster of the Commonwealth - a minimum of os. is paid, while it is proposed to pay 8s. in the arid districts of Western Australia, where the heat of the summer is appalling, and mosquitoes and sandflies make life absolutely unbearable. If honorable members opposite have no consideration for the working man, honorable members on this side have ; and I shall support the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta. </para>

                        <para>- The present Postmaster-General does much better than the honorable member ever did. The new clause proposes not a&#34; maximum, But an absolute minimum. As to the words to which the Prime Minister takes exception, I may say that in some of the awards in New South Wales in which I was concerned, a minimum rate of 7s. was regarded by. railway officers in charge as the rate to be paid, and in subsequent awards words similar to those I have used were inserted, setting forth distinctly that the minimum rate did not prevent an increase being paid. In South Australia to-day the rate for similar work is 8s. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, anywhere in South Australia. In Western Australia 8s. per day is the minimum rate of pay. If these nien are working at points far removed from centres of population in South Australia or Western Australia, it may be necessary for the Government to make them a number of allowances ; it may be necessary to carry all their provisions and supplies, and the Minister, if he thought it justifiable, would certainly increase the rate of pay. I have no fear that the rate will be unduly increased, because I think that the men who do the work of the world, no matter how much they receive,- never get more than that to which they are entitled. Under present conditions, the fight against those who do the work of the world is so keen that they are not likely to get the product of their labour. I should be very pleased if a higher rate than that named in the clause could be prescribed. The Minister of Home Affairs is at present paying in respect of the same class of work in the Federal Territory 8s. per day, whilst those who have broken time receive 9s. per day. </para>

No doubt we should all like to see these men receiving higher wages; but it is only since the Labour party became a force in politics that the working men have had a chance of getting anything like 8s. per day.

                        <para>- The railway men there are the worst paid in Australia ; some of them, with, perhaps, twenty years&#39; service, receiving only 6s. a day. It must be distinctly understood that the proposal is one for a minimum rate of pay and a maximum working day. </para>

                <para>The right honorable member for Swan asked whether we ought not to fix the rates of pay of the professional men in the service ; but, . as a matter of fact, they do not work more than thirty-seven hours per week. If, in their case, a shorter working day is desirable, no doubt the Minister will take action. I should like to see a universal maximum working week of forty-four hours. The great difficulty in connexion with the Railway Departments of Australia- is that a practice has grown up of working the men nine, ten, and twelve hours a day, and that when the workers ask for a forty-eight hours week, the responsible officers at once present an estimate showing that the granting of such a request would mean a loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds, and would really be impracticable. </para>
                <para>My desire is to prevent such a state of affairs growing up in the Commonwealth railway service, so that we shall not have to do a few years hence what we have to do to-day in connexion with the railway services of the States. We have had to collect thousands ot pounds from the workers in the State Departments ; we have had to fight for months and months before Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards, and have then found that precedents that have grown up have a more powerful influence on the  chairman  or presiding Judge than has the equity of a claim for a working week of forty-eight hours. The laying down of these principles in the Bill will do good throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The assumed innocence of the honorable member for Parramatta and the honorable member for Wentworth in these matters is certainly remarkable. The Government position is that they will not ask any adult to work on the construction of this railway for less than 8s. per day for a working week of forty-eight hours. Whilst we accept that principle, we go a great deal further, and say that union rates of wages shall be paid on this work. I have heard it said by honorable members opposite that if 8s. per day were made the minimum, it would prove to be the maxi- mum. The weight of testimony is certainly in favour of inserting neither the one provision nor the other in the Bill itself. I shall go further,, and say publicly, as 1 have already stated, that the policy of the Government is that they will give every facility to any aggrieved body to go to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and that they will pay the highest award fixed by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, any State Wages Board, or State Conciliation Court. That should be a sufficient guarantee to honorable members generally that justice will be done; and I. think the Committee might: well allow the Bill to pass. </para>

                    <para>. - I am gratified to think that the Prime Minister has been induced by the arguments of the Opposition to recede from the position into which he was led by the honorable member for Cook. The arguments advanced by the honorable member for Cook have a very unstable foundation. He says that his reason for asking that a minimum wage of 8s. shall be fixed is that, otherwise, the Department may sweat these men, and pay them still lower wages. He states that he desires a higher wage than 8s. a day; but asks that that rate shall be fixed as a minimum, because, otherwise, the Government will sweat these men. </para>

If that is so, it is obvious that 8s. per day is much too low a minimum to fix for work such as this. There is no question in the minds of honorable members, with the exception, perhaps, of the honorable member for Cook, who sprang up to make a bid for popularity, and found himself in a quagmire- </para>

I have adopted his- phrase ; but if the honorable member thinks it insulting, I shall at once withdraw it. If we are to specify any wage in this Bill, we shall need at least to fix the rate of wages which the Minister of Home Affairs himself has declared shall be paid in Melbourne. The conditions in the case of work on this railway being harder, the wages should be a little higher. </para>

So far as public Departments are concerned, the minimum wage almost invariably becomes the maximum. That has been our experience in all branches of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department; and I am gratified that the Prime Minister has seen the error of his ways in accepting the amendment, and that ample provision is now to be made for paying a decent wage to the men who will be engaged on this arduous work. </para>

                    <para>. - I am pleased that the Prime Minister intends to allow the Bill to remain as it stands. I represent a constituency comprising  2,000  railway workers. They have a strong union, and in different parts of New South Wales different rates of wages are paid. There are two classes of labour engaged in railway construction. At present the minimum for pick and shovel men in New South Wales is fixed at  8s.  per day. They are asking, however, that the rate shall be increased to  9s.  per day. Those who are working in tunnels receive a minimum wage of about  9s.  or  9s. 6d.  a day ; but there are also jumper-men and men engaged in other branches of work, for whom  10s.  per day might not be sufficient, having regard to the country through which this railway will pass. We might, indeed, have to pay  12s.  per day, or more. I think that the Prime Minister has taken the right step in declaring that trade-union rates of wages, whatever they may be, shall be paid. </para>

It would be impossible to secure men to build this line at the rate of wages mentioned in the proposed new clause. I am able to speak with authority on this question, because I have had to pay wages. A man who enters into a contract to construct a railway is foolish if he does not secure the very best labour, and pay the best wages. </para>

                        <para>- I remember more than the honorable member ever knew. A man who talks of men working eight hours a day at plate-laying in the interior of Australia knows nothing of the subject. It is usual to send out a certain quantity of material to the head of the road. There a gang is organized, and if the men put in that material within six hours, they knock off, and get paid for the full day. The&#62; certainly prefer working under such conditions. There was never a more willing class of workers than are those engaged on railway construction works. The working men of Western Australia will, to a man, be anxious to contribute to a fund to build a monument to the memory of the member of the Labour party who has suggested this magnificent wage of  8s.  per day for railway construction workers in that State. </para>

I doubt whether many men will be obtained to go out to perform that work at anything like that wage. It would be very wrong for us to think of proposing any smaller sum than  10s.  a day if we are going to do anything in the way of fixing a minimum wage. </para>

The object of the honorable member for Cook is, of course, to secure a good wage for those employed in the construction of the line, but he need have no anxiety on that score under the existing conditions of Australia. It might be argued that a minimum wage, if fixed, would become the maximum, and I do not thing any one could find fault with a Government for saying, &#34; We will not give more than 8s. a day,&#34; if the law said that they would be within the mark in paying 8s. a day. These things will have to be left to the Government, and although I am in favour of a good wage, it is not desirable to put the amount in the Bill. The Government would be in a better position if they had a free hand. </para>

                        <para>- It seems quite unnecessary, because the Government have already announced that, on all Government work where casual labour obtains, they intend to pay union rates arid work union hours. There is no need, therefore, to fix a minimum wage in this Bill. The best rates prevailing at the time will be paid as a matter of course. If we are going to fix a minimum it will be most unfair to bring it down to 8s., seeing how labour is paid at present in the Commonwealth. The minimum should be 10s. a day at least at a time like this, and if the present prosperity continues it may become more. </para>

                        <para>- I am not objecting to good wages. I want to see the workmen get the best wages that can be paid. The honorable member for Cook is doing himself an injustice. Some one may, perhaps not rightly, suggest that be is making this proposal merely as a placard, so that he may point it out to his electors, saying, &#34; I looked after the interests of the workers. I saw that a minimum of 8s. was put in.&#34; In the circumstances, the honorable member might very well withdraw the amendment, because all that he is seeking is sure to be thoroughly safeguarded in view of what has taken place in this House and of what this Government - and I suppose every other Government that succeeds it - will do in the matter. Wherever Federal work of this sort is to be carried on, it may be safely laid down that whatever Government is in office the proper rate of wage for that work will be paid. </para>

If we were to follow the same practice, and accuse, not only my honorable friends&#39; colleagues in other Legislatures, but perhaps some of themselves personally, with regard to the payment of wages and the . treatment of their employes, we might raise a storm in this Chamber, and seriously injure the feelings of some of those whom wc denounced ; but I do not think that we should be really helping business. We can show better feeling by trying to make the parties in this Chamber responsible for party action in. this Chamber only. . The wages and conditions in the various States are matters for the parties to which we belong in those States to fight out in the light of local conditions. .

                <para class="block">I had intended to move an amendment . to this effect on clause 4, but was .unavoidably absent from the Chamber when that clause&#39; was passed. The route which I think should be followed has a number of advantages. The character of the country to be passed through is known, its water supply is known, and its adoption would enable construction -to be carried on simultaneously from six points, namely, at. Kalgoorlie eastwards, at Port Augusta westwards, and at Fowler&#39;s Bay and at Eucla in both directions. The southern route which I advocate is shorter than that provided for in the schedule, and, according to the estimate of a competent engineer,, would cost about &#163;700,000 less. The engineer to whom I refer is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth,</inline> one of the most competent railway engineers in Australia. An estimate of the probable cost of the work was made in March, 1903, by a conference of engineers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth</inline> made another estimate on his own account. In July of the same year the conference of engineers reduced&#39; its estimate to within a few pounds of his., Then, again, the conference of engineers estimated the cost of surveying the route at &#163;50,000, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gwynneth&#39;s</inline> estimate was &#163;20,000, and the work was done for that sum. I have a number of figures and statements which support the proposal which I have made to the Committee, but at this hour I do not propose to use them.. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the closing hours of last Parliament, the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill was introduced by the late Government, and passed ; but on the first occasion on which a claim was made by a seaman for compensation, the High Court ruled that Parliament, in providing for trade within a State, had gone further than it was constitutionally entitled to do, and the whole measure was declared null and void. The Bill I am now introducing is exactly similar to the measure passed by the last Parliament, with the exception that the provision objected to by the High Court is omitted. I find, on looking up the records, that the Bill in last Parliament was passed through all its stages in an hour and a half ; and, as I believe the House is practically unanimous in the desire to protect the seamen, I shall take up no further time on the present occasion. </para>

                        <para>. - I see no objection to the Bill going through, since it merely corrects one of the details in the similar measure introduced by the Government, of which I had the honour to be a member. I should like to say, however, that this Bill is an answer to the statements which were made throughout Australia on the occasion of the referenda that this Government would have no power to give compensation to seamen unless the referenda were approved. We have very substantial power which is embodied in the Bill before u&#38;. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister is acting wisely in submitting this Bill, although we have been called upon so suddenly to deal with it as to place us at a disadvantage in considering it without notice. It would appear, so far as one can form an opinion on the spur of the moment, that the Minister has correctly stated the effect of the recent decision of the High Court. That decision has been to render the principal Act invalid; but I think that this measure is so drafted as to bring it within the general powers conferred by the Constitution. Section 51 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect to trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States, while section 98 declares that the power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping. We are, therefore, empowered to make laws with respect to navigation and shipping with other countries and among the States, and the Bill is so drafted as practically to declare <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> that the principal Act shall apply to ships engaged in trade and commerce with other countries and among the States. Speaking off-hand, it would appear that the Bill is framed in such a way as to confine our jurisdiction within the absolute terms of the Constitution. The Commonwealth has jurisdiction over trade and commerce with other countries and among the States, whilst the States themselves have jurisdiction over trade and commerce within the States. The Commonwealth Parliament may, therefore, pass a measure providing for adequate compensation to seamen who are engaged in the shipping trade between State and State, or between Australia and other countries, and the State Legislatures may also legislate on exactly the same terms in regard to granting compensation within a State, so that the whole area may thus be covered. </para>

The desire of all parts of the House is that we shall do all that is possible to secure compensation for seamen, and this Bill will be a useful contribution to legislation in that direction. </para>

Since that Bill became law, quite a number of business people are claiming that their catalogues, trade papers, and price-lists are books. There was no intention on my part to allow price-lists or catalogues to go through as books. There seems to be a little difficulty in defining exactly what a book is. In order to make sure that catalogues and price-lists shall not be allowed to go through the post as books, this Bill has been introduced. </para>

                        <para>- No ; they went through as commercial papers and printed matter, at the rate of  4  02. for id. The Penny Postage Bill fixed the rate for that sort of matter at 2 oz. for Jd., which was rather an advantage. . A price-list weighing 2 oz. would previously have cost id., while one weighing  6  oz. would have cost 2d. That Bill made the postage on 2 oz. Jd., and on <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> oz. i$d. It has, therefore, made it easier and cheaper to send catalogues, price-lists and other printed matter through the post. We provided in the Penny Postage Bill, as introduced, that newspapers and magazines printed in Australia should go through the post at a cheaper rate than newspapers and magazines printed outside; and I agreed to an amendment according the same privilege in the case of books. We are prepared to continue that privilege for books in the ordinary sense, but we do not believe that catalogues and printed lists should be treated as books. As the Supply Bill has now been returned from another place, I ask for permission to continue my speech at a later date. </para>
