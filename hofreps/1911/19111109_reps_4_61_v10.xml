I ask for a statement which will give honorable members information regarding the works on. which it is proposed to spend the special appropriation of  £600,000.  I do not ask for any information beyond what it is usual to give when Estimates are under discussion. My suggestion is made with a view to assisting the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has asked a question upon a very serious subject. I feel that I shall best 'preserve the dignity of this Dominion by following the example of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, who, when a like question was asked in the House of Commons, replied that he thought that at this juncture the discussion of unofficial reports was inadvisable in our own interests and in those of civilization. I have read what has appeared in the newspapers, and the reports appear to be those of independent and trustworthy correspondents. We all regret that atrocities such as those described should take place, and I venture to say  that both sides deplore them, but I do not think that any action we might take at present would have any but a disadvantageous result. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think it is necessary for me to say much more in recommending this Bill to the Committee. I have already pointed  out that it will be of considerable benefit to shareholders of banks, and also of great benefit to the public, if shareholders in banks from time to time take advantage of its provisions. I do not wish to occupy more time than is absolutely necessary in discussing the measure because I am anxious that it shall, if possible, be passed through its remaining stages this afternoon. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment and reserve any criticism they may have to offer until we reach clause 4 which practically contains the kernel of the Bill. </para>

If any payment were made to the trustees I should imagine it would be a very small sum, and it would be paid out of the actual amount raised under the terms of clause 7. Very little trouble would be involved in working this particular scheme. </para>

                    <para>! - I cannot understand why. having regard to the extraordinary degree of intellectual capacity centred in the promoters of this measure, it has been necessary for the honorable member in charge of the Bill to propose this amendment at the present stage. It will be noticed that the clause as it stands provides that -  " Net profits " means the profit made after full and due provision for current expenditure has been made, and does not include the proceeds from the realization of assets or the conversion of reserves or any portion of reserves. </para>

I have tried to discover where the idea originated. The only discovery I have been able to make is that at the time of the bank smashes in 1893, when some of the shareholders were called upon to pay up their uncalled liabilities, somebody thought it would have been an excellent idea if a measure of this kind had been in existence to provide a reserve liability fund. That is the only instance I know of where anybody, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> has expressed a desire for the passage of a. Bill of this kind. Does the honorable member for Richmond know of any meeting of shareholders or of directors being held to consider the Bill? </para>

                        <para>- I read last year's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but all I saw in that regard was a few letters sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> expressing belief in the Bill. The senator, however, quoted no high authority. None of the directors of the principal banks - the Bank of New South Wales, for example - expressed an opinion on the subject. Has not the Bank of Australasia, or the Union Bank, or the Queensland National Bank, any opinion on the measure? When the Bill was in Committee previously the honorable member for Richmond said - </para>

                    <para>In most cases the shares of the banks were originally subscribed by men of substance, who could have met their liabilities had they been called on to do so. But, as time has passed, the shares have got largely into the hands of small investors. Bank shares have been regarded as a first-class security, and now, in many instances, are held by persons who derive their sole income from their dividends. The honorable member (for Maribyrnong) would be surprised, if he went through a bank share-list, to see how many women figure as shareholders. In many cases their whole living, or a considerable part of it, is derived from the dividends. But the point I am making is that many of the shareholders are persons of no substance, or of only small means. </para>

                <para class="block">What are we to infer from that? What is the object of the Bill? Originally, according to the honorable member, the people who held bank shares were men of substance. They got in on the ground floor, so to speak, and when they had managed to work up the bank business to dividends of 10 or 20 per cent., their shares, for which about <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> each was paid, were sold on the market at <inline font-style="italic">£40.</inline> It is a well-known fact that when shares returning 10 per cent, on the paid-up capital are put on the market, they will bring double their paid-up price. Later on I shall quote instances of shares paid up to ^20 being worth ,£40 on the market today. Where the dividend is 10 per cent, on the paid-up capital the return to the investor in that case is only 5 per cent. Here we get at the real meaning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> benevolent proposal. According to the honorable member for Richmond the people who have bought these shares from the men of substance are small investors who derive their sole income from the dividends. Can the Committee imagine a philanthropist bringing forward a Bill which, if it is going to do anything, will deprive those small investors of part of their sole income? Take the case of a bank paying a 10 per cent, dividend per annum. Imagine a husband saying to his wife, " We have saved  £1,000  I shall invest that in a bank, because bank shares are a very sound security. The dividend is 10 per cent, on the paid-up capital, but we shall get only 5 per cent, on our investment. Instead of getting ^100 per annum we shall get <inline font-style="italic">£50,</inline> so that if anything happens to me you will have ,£50 per annum for the rest of your life." But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W-alker</inline> comes along and says " No, we are going to take ^5 of that."  His  proposal is to take at least r per cent., and he might take 2 per cent. </para>

That shows the whole object of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that aspect of the question. First, let me ask, what is the reason for these uncalled liabilities? For example, there is <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline> of uncalled capital in connexion with the shares of one bank, <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> 10s. in another, <inline font-style="italic">£15</inline> in ^another, ^20 in another, and so on. The Bank of Australasia has a reserve liability of ^40 per share; the City Bank, £10 ; the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> 10s., and I ask, What is the reason for this? I take it that the banks were given a charter providing for a reserve liability, because it was believed that this would act as a check or control on the directors, and restrain them from entering upon any risky speculation. I can well believe that bank directors, knowing that they are voted to their position by the shareholders, and that, if they make any mistake, ruin may be brought on their institution, are more likely to adopt sound banking with a reserve liability than would otherwise be the case. In the absence of any reserve liability, directors might be induced to take risks, and advance ^£200, 000 to a person who already had an overdraft of ^100,000, or take upon themselves to finance gold, copper, or tin mining ventures, feeling that, as the funds were all paid up, no harm could be done. That is the view I offer to the honorable member for Coolgardie as one reason why we should not do away with the reserve liability. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to get away from the main point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> in introducing this Bill, is attacking the widow and the orphan - the small investor whose sole income is. derived from the bank dividends. Not only is there a reserve liability in some cases, but there is also an unpaid portion of the capital which may be called up at any time. Let us take the" case of the unfortunate widow with two or three children, who receives  .£100  per annum in bank dividends as her sole income. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> proposes that that income should be reduced to  £90,  and it is possible that, a widow with a house of her own might not be able to face the situation and provide for her two- or three children with that amount. </para>

There is another aspect of the case. There are people who are not of small means, and who do not derive their sole income from bank dividends. Is a shareholder, who has his wits about him, going to hand over his  10  per cent, dividend to trustees ? The honorable member for Richmond said that it is not very likely that these trustees or directors will be paid ; but I believe not only in the payment of members but in payment of directors and of all who do good and efficient service for the community. There is no doubt that if trustees do this work they will expect to be paid, and I suppose they will receive about  £1,000  per annum. Is it likely that shareholders will allow their dividends to be retained by the bank for all time? Are they not much more likely to take the view that they can use the money themselves to much better advantage, and to demand the full dividend? I suppose that investments of a sound character, outside Government securities, return about  5  per. cent. One can hardly imagine a shareholder saying to the directors of a bank, " I notice that my dividends amount to  £100.  As I cannot trust myself with so much money, please put  £10  into a fund to meet a liability," which, according to the honorable member for Richmond, is not likely to have to be met, the banks being so sound. To prove what I have stated about the earnings of the banks, I wish to make a quotation from the share list of Messrs. Joseph Palmer and Sons, stock and sharebrokers, of  96  Pitt-street, Sydney. The following table is of interest : - </para><para class="block">

Honorable members will notice that, although a company may be paying  20  per cent, in dividends, an investor in its shares does not get anything like that return. For instance, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company makes a profit of  10  per cent., but as its paid-up shares of <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> are worth about£45, investor to-day gets less than 5 per cent. Then, although the dividends declared range from2½ to  20  per cent., the return from investments ranges only from to 6 per cent. </para><para class="block">

                </para><para class="block">The reserves that I have read out represent on paper some millions of money, but the eminent King's Counsel, the honorable member for Flinders, told the House when he spoke on this measure a little while ago that these reserves are most misleading. He told us that a " reserve " - </para><quote>
                    <para>Does not point to any goods, or any sovereigns or to anything in particular. It merely means that there is an a mount not represented by any appropriated assets of the company - which has not been distributed in dividends. The word " reserve " is extremely misleading to many people, generally conveying to a large section of the public an idea that there are some moneys or funds put aside. That is not the case. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I have read out amounts running from tens of thousands to millions of pounds which are set forth to-day in the balance-sheets of the various banks as representing reserve funds. But the honorable member for Flinders, with all the responsibility which his position imposes upon him, says that they represent no goods or sovereigns, or anything in particular. That brings me to the great danger that we shall run in passing this clause. It will rest with the directors to decide how much is to be set aside in this reserve fund, and they, as a matter of fact, are the only people who know whether or not their bank is solvent. We see at the foot of every bank balance-sheet a certificate by the auditors to the effect that " the foregoing is a true and correct account of the bank's affairs according to the books." This form of certificate first came into use about eighteen years ago. Previously the auditors used to give a certificate to the effect that " the foregoing is a true and correct balance-sheet showing the state of the affairs of the bank." Every auditor used to sign a similar certificate without much consideration until a couple of them got into gaol. The auditors then protected themselves by altering their certificate in the way I have indicated, so that it now reads that the balance-sheet gives a true and correct account of the bank's affairs " according to the books." Honorable members can well imagine what a clerk who writes a good hand can do under direction in the way of bookkeeping. He can. produce a work of art, and that was sometimes done prior to the banking smash. I wish to point out to honorable members, who are inclined to give way, and to fall in with the idea entertained by a certain legislator, who would like to go down to posterity with his name attached to at least one measure, that the directors of a bank" alone know whether or not it is solvent. As a matter of fact even they hardly know whether it is or is not, because as a bank manager once said to me, " The difficulty is to get branch managers with common sense." We all know what is the position of a bank manager in some of our unfortunate lonely little towns where, through sheer loneliness, men are sometimes driven to drink. A bank manager so situated perhaps meets a neighbouring squatter, or some local business man, who, after they have had a drink or two, says, " You had better let me increase my overdraft by  £10,000  or  £15,000.  I have any number of sheep and cattle on my run, and everything will be all right." In a weak moment the branch bank manager consents to the overdraft being increased, and in due course forwards a report to head-quarters. The bank's inspector probably accepts the report that the assets of the borrower are as represented, and the directors, believing that their institution is perfectly solvent, continue to pay dividends; but even they do not really know whether or not the bank is solvent. On the dictum of the directors alone depends the amount of the dividends to be paid ; and we can well understand the temptations of these days of " rigging the market " - an expression which, I regret to say, we sometimes see in the press. People we will assume are looking for a safe investment, and they say, " Well, here is a bank paying a dividend of  10  per  cent.,  per annum, which will give me on my investment a return of  '5  per cent.," and they invest accordingly. But what may not an evil-minded director do? There have been such gentlemen, as those who remember the banking smash of  1893  well know. Some of them were ordered to spend a little time in Darlinghurst, largely for the good of the community. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- That is true. Some of the smaller fry were convicted, but some of the bigger fellows got off. Some of the bigger men in Queensland were brought to trial, but the presiding Judge took a merciful view of their case, probably because they were very aged, and their acquittal was secured. It is important to remember that this Bill will leave it in the power of the directors of a bank to say at any time, " This year we will pay into this special reserve fund  2  per cent, of the amount that would otherwise be available as dividends." That, of course, would mean that the return on the investment would be reduced accordingly, and a bank returning, as I have shown, per cent, would return only 1½ per cent. Then the poor widows and other shareholders would no doubt go to Messrs. Palmer and Sons or some other well-known firm of sharebrokers, and say, " Don't you think we had better sell our shares? We can get only so much per cent." Finally they would put their shares on the market, and down would go values. Shares which brought, perhaps,  £40  before might fall to  ,£35, /"2s,  or  £20.  But the men " in the know " - the men who had rigged the market - would be able to say, " We know that these shares are all right. We can buy in at  £20,  and next year we will pay a dividend at the full rate, and refrain from paying anything into this reserve fund." In these circumstances I hold that the Bill embodies a bad principle. I see nothing to recommend it, and I therefore propose to vote against both the amendment and the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>.- When this Bill was before the House last session I took strong exception to it, because I did not think that the proposed appointment of trustees would meet the desire of quite a number of people who have invested in banking shares in the past and have suffered. The amendment is more concise and explanatory than the clause as it stands, and I shall therefore vote for it. I have not taken any part in the debate on the measure this session, but so far as I am able to understand the position, the Bill will be an advantage to all banks that have their head offices in Australia, and are controlled here, as against those whose head offices and controlling power are in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. I have here a list of banks having a majority of shares, in number and value, as well as their head offices and boards of management, outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Some of these have also more than one class of shareholders; and this proposed permissive legislation could not for these reasons be taken advantage of by them. Among the number is the Bank of Australasia, the English,. Scottish, and Australian Bank, the London Bank of Australasia, the Union Bank of Australia, the National Bank of New Zealand, and the New Zealand Bank. With the exception of the last named all have their head offices in London. The reserves and undivided profits of the Bank of Australasia amount to £1,825,000, as against a paid-up capital of £1,600,000. That would really more than counterbalance the full liability of the shareholders. Although the shares are paid up, there is still a reserve liability of the shareholders, under their charter, of £1,600,000. In the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank the paid-up capital is £539,437- It has reserves and undivided profits of £245,000. The London Bank of Australia, which has ordinary and preference shares, has a reserve fund of £102,000, with a liability for uncalled capital of £736,000. The paid-up capital of the Union Bank of Australia is £1,500,000. The undivided profits and reserves amount to £1,450,000. It has no uncalled capital liability, but it has still a reserve liability of £3,000,000. That is only payable in the event of the bank liquidating, which I hope will never happen. The National Bank of New Zealand has a paid-up capital of £475,000. The reserves and undivided profits amount to £460,000. There is a direct liability upon the shareholders for uncalled capital of ,£750,000, but no reserve liability. The Bank of New Zealand, with its head office in Auckland, has a paid-up capital of £500,000 and reserves of £1,034,000, or actually double the amount of paid-up capital. The liability for uncalled capital on the shares is £500,000, and there is also a reserve liability of £1,000,000. All this liability may to a certain extent assure depositors and investors in the various banks of their greater stability, but to my mind it would be far better to adopt the plan suggested in this Bill, the whole of which meets with my full approval, and I have given some attention to it. It would certainly be wise, if this Bill is passed, for any one who has money to invest to put it into the shares of banks to which the Bill will apply, at the current rates, because as the reserve liability is gradually wiped out by the apportionment of the profits, as indicated by clause 3, the shares of those banks will rise in value. The Bill will give extra stability to the Australian banks, but its operation may not be quite fair to non Australian banks doing business here, which at present are on an equal footing in all respects with local banks. They will be at a disadvantage in that they cannot take advantage of this law, which is applicable only to Australian banks, and also to banks having more than £100,000 of permanent paid up capital. The following purely Australian banks would also be debarred from taking advantage of this law, owing to their having either less than ,£100,000 of permanent paid-up capital, or more than one class of shares : - The Ballarat Banking Company, an institution which has established itself firmly in Victoria and paid very fine dividends; its paid-up capital is only £85,000, but, of course, it could bring itself within the scope of this measure by making a further call of capital to the extent of .£15,000; the City Bank of Sydney, in regard to the shares of which there is some difficulty which I have not had clearly explained to me; the Commercial Bank of Australia, which has ordinary and preference shares, a distinction which will prevent it from taking advantage of the measure; the National Bank of Australasia, to which the same thing applies ; the Royal Bank of Queensland, which has 4,609 ,£10 preference shares fully paid up; the Victoria Land Bank, which has ordinary and preference shares ; and the Colonial Bank of Australasia, to which the same disability applies. That is the Bank in which I had the privilege of serving as an officer, and from which I was glad to get away, as I would rather be a member of this House. The honorable member for Richmond will agree with me that it is much more pleasant to be one's own master and a member of this House than to be an officer even of a bank. </para>

After eliminating the foregoing, the following Australian and Tasmanian banks would remain eligible to take advantage of this measure - The Bank of Adelaide, paid-up capital £400,000, reserves and undivided profits £399,000, liability for uncalled capital £125,000, and reserve liability £625,000 ; Australian Bank of Commerce Limited, paid-up capital £958,172, reserves and undivided profits ,£3,500, uncalled liability nil, reserve liability nil ; Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, paid-up capital .£1,500,000, reserves and undivided profits £1,450,000, liability for uncalled capital £1,500,000,  reserve liability nil ; Commercial Bank of Tasmania, paid-up capital £175-000, reserves and undivided profits £193,000, liability of shareholders for uncalled" capital £525,000, reserve liability nil; Bank of New South" Wales, paid-up capital £2,700,000, reserves and undivided profits £2,040,000, liability of shareholders for uncalled capital nil, but reserve liability of shareholders £2,500,000 ; National Bank of Tasmania Limited, paid-up capital £152,040, reserves and undivided profits ,£46,000, uncalled capital liability £80,000; North Queensland Bank Limited, paid-up capital £100,000, reserves and undivided profits £23,000, uncalled capital liability £250,000; Queensland National Bank Limited, paid-up capital £413,296, reserves and undivided profits £94,000, liability for uncalled capital £320,000; Royal Bank of Australia Limited, paid-up capital £300,000, reserves and undivided profits £143,000, liability for uncalled capital £900,000 ; Bank of Western.

                </para>
                <para>In the case of the limited liability companies this liability has the effect of restricting investment in these companies' shares. In the case of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited this liability is practically covered by the reserves. The reserves are, however, mainly invested in the business, and, rightly speaking, should be treated as capital. The actual reserves are those specially invested plus the liability of shareholders for uncalled capital. In a limited liability company this latter protection may be very shadowy - that is, the shareholders may have no tangible assets other than the moneys they have invested in the shares. </para>
                <para>The effect of the proposed law would be to allow companies to continue to use their existing nominal reserve funds in the business, or even distribute these reserves by instalments amongst shareholders, at the same time building up a fund in the hands of trustees which would completely extinguish any nominal liability for uncalled capital. This would have a tendency to stimulate investment in such companies' shares, and after it had been in operation for a year or two would cause a material increase in the price of such shares. </para>
                <para>The average man- who has a current account does not go into the question of the liability of the shareholders of the bank. I cannot remember ever being asked, when filling up a deposit receipt for an investor, what was the paid-up capital of the bank or the amount of the liability of the shareholders. I have asked a good many tellers and those in charge of the issue of deposit receipts about this matter, and I have not met one who has been asked within the last five years any question as to the reserve liability or the uncalled capital liability of the shareholders.

Their reputed reserves are either equal to or in excess of their paid-up capital, but these reputed reserves are mainly employed in the business and are therefore such only in name. The principal safeguard which depositors have in these cases, apart from the solvency of the banks, is the responsibility of the shareholders. The proposed law will have the effect of permitting the present reserves to be appropriated or gradually diminished, perhaps in providing for already ascertained losses, or in paying increased dividends to shareholders, while at the same time a fund is being built up which will ultimately relieve shareholders of all liability, and it will be no longer incumbent on directors to provide reserve funds at all. </para>

                    <para>The Bill makes an unfair discrimination in favour of certain institutions - buttressing them in such a way that they obtain an unfair advantage as compared with others, and, at the same time, relieving them from a responsibility which others are bound to continue to carry. The carrying of the measure must have the effect of increasing the market price of certain shares through the prospect of relieving holders of  a  substantial liability which they should certainly be compelled to bear. Then there is the bad moral effect likely to be created through absence of responsibility- If shareholders desire to reap handsome profits they should surely be compelled to take some moderate risk in the making of such profits.  1 consider that the fact that the shareholders put their money into the shares is an earnest, so far as they are concerned. </para>

If any honorable member really desires to understand the Bill, he ought to ask any stockbroker or other dealer. in shares if he ever met an investor who inquired deeply what liabilities they would incur when they paid the necessary cover for the shares.

                <para class="block">A number of people are inclined to take exception to the word "borrowing"; but as a matter of fact the rank and file of the people, who are the working classes, really supply the coin which the banks use to make huge profits for a few. I am informed that sometimes directors themselves do not exactly know into what particular corner certain secret reserves have been placed, and if that be so, what of the shareholders or the public generally? I intend to move a further amendment providing that before any profits are distributed the books of the banks shall be audited by Government officials, in the same way as are municipal accounts. If the investing public knew that the affairs of financial institutions were subject to Government inspection, they would feel much greater security than under the present private and perfunctory method. </para>

                    <para>.- I trust that the proposal of the honorable member for Herbert will receive the support of the House. The pearl-shelling industry, although absolutely dependent on the legislation and administration of the Commonwealth Parliament and Government, is by no means familiar to honorable members and to the public, because it is carried on in the remoter parts of Australia, chiefly at Thursday Island, off the Queensland coast, arid from Dirk Hartog Island to beyond Broome, off the coast of Western Australia. Naturally its conditions vary, and despite this variation it has been attempted to apply to it a uniform set of regulations. I regret that the honorable (member for Herbert has stated that the pearlers have not attempted to meet the (desires of the Government by trying to substitute white for black labour. Whatever may be said of the Thursday Island pearlers, about whose work I know little, I can affirm, from intimate knowledge of the pearlers of Western Australia, during the last seven or eight years, that they have made every attempt to give effect to the Government regulations, although these have operated harshly upon them. Many of them are convinced that to substitute white for black labour, especially for diving, is impracticable, if not impossible, but, nevertheless, they are willing to put their hands into their pockets to pay for the experiment. More cannot be expected of them. Had the honorable member for Herbert read carefully the proposals of the Western Australian Pearlers Association, he would not have said what he did. Amongst other things the members of the association say - </para>

                    <para>By having each vessel of the fleet entirely manned by whites, every man, it is hoped, will obtain not only a training in diving and tendering work, but a knowledge of local navigation" and seamanship essential to the proper performance of his respective duties. On each man attaining proficiency as a diver or tender, endeavours will be made to find employment on pearling vessels belonging to members of the Association, the vacancies thereby occurring in the training station being filled by further recruits. The Association believe that under no other method is it' practical to effect the change from Asiatic to white divers without dislocating the whole industry, and imposing extreme hardship on the many small proprietorships comprising it. </para>

                <para class="block">As the full text of the statement- has been published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I shall not read more of it now. What I have read proves my assertion, and disproves what has been said by the honorable member. The Western Australian pearlers may have not succeeded in getting white divers, but they are difficult to obtain. When the <inline font-style="italic">Pericles</inline> sank, off the Leeuwin, a year and a half ago, it was almost impossible to obtain the services of a white diver. How, then, can it be thought easy to obtain white divers to live the lives that have to be passed on the pearling boats, and to descend to the great depths at which the shell is found? The industry receives little sympathy from persons who are prepared to subsidize other industries largely at the expense of the taxpayer. Pearl shelling is a very perilous vocation. Storms and typhoons frequently devastate the fleets, and destroy hundreds of lives. Within the past three years, there have been two big storms, in which much, property has been destroyed, and many lives lost. The impression used to prevail that pearl shelling is carried on by large companies, making enormous profits ; that it is a business for rich men. At one time three or four companies operated almost exclusively on the north-west coast of Australia, but now the industry is carried on by comparatively poor men, many of the pearl shellers being carpenters who, having got together a little money, have built luggers at Fremantle, and had them taken round to Broome or Derby. With the exception of one firm in Broome, noone owns more than three or four boats. Again, although the industry is profitable when shell is fetching a high price in London, it is difficult to get even black labour for it, and it is subject to stringent regulations, and there are also the- losses from storms to which I have referred. The Department of External Affairs has on occasion relaxed its regulations. When the town of Broome was almost destroyed by a cyclone, it allowed the black labour engaged in the pearl-shelling business to be employed on shore in rebuilding the place, and, on the whole, there is no cause for complaint. But, wanting local knowledge, the departmental heads are entirely dependent on the advice of the officer on the spot at Broome, and sometimes that gentleman is disposed to interpret his instructions too literally. In one case an employer, having four or five black divers whom he wished to send back to the islands, desired to ship them from Port Hedland, but as the departmental instructions say that seamen divers and tenders who have been shipped at Broome must be discharged there, the officer refused to allow these men to be discharged at Port Hedland. Vessels do not call frequently at the ports on the north-west coast, and the discharging of these men at Broome would have meant their maintenance for three or four weeks, and the extra expense of the fare from Broome to Port Hedland. Such an instruction would not be enforced were the Minister fully acquainted with local conditions. If Parliament wishes the industry to continue, we should ascertain by personal investigation what conditions are best for it, and for the Commonwealth. If, on the other hand, it is determined to wipe it out, that determination should be made known, and compensation should be paid to those who will suffer by it. On the other hand, if we permit it to be carried on we ought to try to devise conditions that will enable it to be continued -without imperilling the policy of a White Australia. As I understand that the time allotted to the consideration of general business, Orders of the Day, has almost expired, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

                    <para>.- Since Thursday last, when I asked for leave to continue my remarks on this motion, my attitude in regard to it has been continually misrepresented. In the first place, a statement was made in the local press that I deliberately talked out the motion. Hansard shows, however, that whilst I was speaking the honorable member for Wentworth suggested that as the time allotted to the consideration of private members' business had almost expired I should ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. It shows, further, that I promptly adopted that suggestion, but that the honorable member for North Sydney objected to leave being granted. Since then the honorable member for North Sydney has written to the daily press of Sydney a letter, in which he makes the statement that the Minister, through his representative, deliberately blocked discussion on one occasion, and that his followers had now talked out the motion. The honorable member for Wentworth, and the honorable member for North Sydney, who claim that they are anxious to see justice done to the officers and men of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth, are not going the right way to assist them. I rose last Thursday to support this motion, and there are many members of our party who are also in favour of it. The honorable member for Maranoa supported the motion, and also the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, so that it is really a gross misrepresentation of the facts to say, as the honorable member for North Sydney and the honorable member for Wentworth have allowed it to be said in the press, that we deliberately tried to talk out this motion. The facts are that the motion was not talked out, and that it still remains on the business-paper. Former Parliaments recognised that it was their duty to do something in connexion with this matter, as shown by the fact that section 123 of the Defence Act 1903-10 provides - </para>

                <para>That, in the best interest of the public and of the Commonwealth Postal Service, the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services should (in a general sense) be adopted by this House. </para>
                <para class="block">I need not inform the House that I regard this as one of the most crucial periods in my existence as a. public man. During my political career I have had occasion to address this and other Parliaments upon matters of very serious concern to the welfare of the people, but on no occasion has it fallen to my lot to face such an exceptionally heavy task as that which now lies before me. It is no exaggeration to say that, for practically four years, I have been soaking myself, so to speak, in the affairs of the postal services of Australia ; and after such a lengthy term of critical and minute observation on one of the most extensive inquiries ever held in this country, I think I may well claim the indulgence of .honorable members while I endeavour to do justice to the subject that I have taken in hand. I may briefly summarize the subjects to which I intend to address myself. In the first place, I shall give a short review of the trials and vicissitudes of the Royal Commission, of which I had the honour to be a member. Next will follow a brief history of the PostmasterGeneralships under both State and Federal control ; and thereafter I shall give an indication of the condemnation of the system by the Public Service Commissioner, and 6y the Public Service Inspectors. I shall also deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> evidence on the question of salaries, and other matters of importance in relation to the Department. I propose then to review the Ministerial changes that have been made since 100S,  when the Commission entered upon its inquiry, as well as to indicate the departmental changes that have been made since that date. Questions appertaining to Boards of Inquiry that have received a'ttention during that period will next engage my consideration, together with questions by the Public Service Commissioner, dealing with rates of salary, classification, &amp;c. Honorable members will thereafter be given the results of the system, or lack of system, under the old <inline font-style="italic">regime;</inline> and I hope also to deal with the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Scott. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -MeLachlan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> - the three most prominent officers of the Commonwealth service - concerning what the management of this great institution ought to be. In the next place, I shall review the Public Service Commissioner's latest report on the Report of the Royal Commission, as that gentleman had a. double deal, so to speak, as. compared with all others who had to place their case before the Commission. Finally, I shall endeavour to sum up the actual' situation. In attempting to give a brief history of the Commission, I may be pardoned by the House if I have to be somewhat severe in my observations. It is a painful, but nevertheless a necessary duty to perform, in order that honorable members may know the difficulty that will beset them when at any time they endeavour to secure means of doing justice to some big Government concern. I hope for the indulgence of the House while I attempt one of the most arduous tasks that has ever fallen to the lot of any Parliamentarian. It is to me particularly arduous, inasmuch as I stand practically alone. I have a full recognition of my infirmities, and I appreciate also my limited capacity, due, to some extent, to restricted education, and to the fact that I have had to spend the greater part of my life in an occupation involving: hard physical toil. With these drawbacks. I appeal for the consideration of honorable members. The magnitude of my task may be understood when I point out that the shearers' dispute, although it does not involve machinery anything like as intricate as that relating to this great Department, has taken, not hours, but; days, to present to the Court. The advocates of the respective parties have occupied days in presenting to the Court the points involved in that dispute, although, compared with those covered by the report of the Royal Commission, they ave comparatively few in number. The Postmaster-General's Department was described by the late Public Service Inspector of New South Wales as being of infinitely vaster proportions than is the machinery of any railway service in the world. I mention these facts to show that I have before me no easy task in endeavouring to marshal the whole of the essential evidence so as to put it as concisely as possible .before the House. I have also laboured under a difficulty in- that I have had no assistance in the preparation of this case, such as I might have had if one of my late colleagues had been returned to this House at the last general elections. I am the only member of the House who occupied a seat on the Commission, and have not had an opportunity to distribute any portion of the work involved in this connexion amongst others who could have assisted me, had they been re-elected to Parliament. I think I shall be able to show that the criticisms of the Commission, although visibly melting at the present time, have certainly been very considerable. It is my desire to place this matter before the country, which is interested in it, in such a way that its importance may be realized. It is now about four years since I accidentally came into contact with the affairs of the General Post Office. There was no material trouble in my own electorate. I had generally been able, by vigilance and attention to duty, to alleviate the difficulties which undoubtedly occurred from time to time in that vast area, but they would not have been sufficient to warrant me in attempting to diagnose the cause of all the troubles in the Department. It was when I offered to take up the work of the present Attorney-General, on his leaving for England on the Navigation Commission, that I was brought into close contact with the Postal Department of New South Wales, and became cognisant of facts which I had seriously to consider on behalf of that gentleman and his constituents. My curiosity was aroused by what I heard, my interest by what I saw. Eventually I came to the conclusion that there was something so radically wrong with the whole machine that nothing short of a searching inquiry would ever effectually remedy the disease. It became apparent to me that a Royal Commission was the only way in which we could get to the bottom of the trouble. I tabled a motion, which remained on the notice-paper for some time. I endeavoured to get the Government of the day to acquiesce in it, but they did not see their way clear to do so. In order to thwart my efforts, they appointed what they called a Cabinet Committee of Inquiry, to investigate this vast concern. The futility of that appointment was palpable to any one who knew the task that had to be faced, and the partial report of the Committee was of little value to the Department or to the Government. Subsequently I met with very strong opposition from the Government, but determined to persevere. It is a matter of history that I took advantage of the Standing Orders to move a motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission. The Government of the day were adamant to my private appeals, although I was friendly to them, and as they would not concede the point, I moved for the Commission in the House in the way I have indicated. The Government opposed it, and it will be remembered that, while the honorable member for Ballarat, who was then Prime Minister, was endeavouring to thwart my efforts, the wily members of the then Opposition were also trying to " dish " him. The Leader of the Opposition and his  deputy  were watching the political barometer very closely, and when the honorable member for Ballarat saw that he had to choose between being dragooned by me or by the Opposition, he decided that he would prefer the treatment of a friend to that of an antagonist. He then withdrew his motion, and allowed me to proceed. I can never forget that day - a day of excitement such as has rarely been equalled in this Parliament. Time after time I was appealed to by Ministerialists and by members of my own party to compromise, but I realized that there was no room for compromise on questions of this kind. The issue at stake was too big. There was too big a body of people affected. The general public had been suffering for too long, and therefore I had no option, as a representative of the people, but to go right on with my work. It was remarkable on that occasion, when I came in a little late after going through the last interview, to find how solid the Opposition sat. One would have thought they were the Labour party. Not one man moved. We, as a Labour party, could have envied them the solid way in which they eventually voted in support of the proposition. Six of my friends from this side passed over with myself to the other side, and four of them have since been elevated to office. Those four, I may say, did not specially favour the motion, but had some other fish to fry. The other two that came over with me I knew I could rely upon to see me through under any conditions, but at any rate those two, who were desirous of achieving the end that I was aiming at, together with the four who voted for the motion for an object which I need not mention, but which they have since secured, or nearly secured, helped me to carry the motion against the Government. I have never seen the honorable member for Ballarat so angry as he was on that occasion. Bitter were the recriminations that were cast across the chamber, and one Minister came to me and said, " You have killed us." I said, " Not so; you attempted suicide, but there is still a hope for you " - and there was a hope. The Government at first made it a vital question. They were going out upon it. The Governor-General was summoned from Kosciusko in a hurry. He got back in a hurry, too; but an hour before he arrived some one reached the stool of repentance, with the result that the resignation of the Government was not handed in. They did not go out, and the Royal Commission was granted. That is the pleasant part of the episode. To the unpleasant part I should prefer not to refer, but it must be done. The public man who is afraid to do that which hurts some one's feelings is either a coward or an imposter, and I do not profess to be either, whatever else I may be. </para>
                <para>It is the subsequent history of the Commission that troubles me. Prior to taking my seat on the Commission, I heard, from a quarter where I did not seek for information, that the Commission would be of no avail to me; that we would be allowed to go on for a. time, until a financial report was submitted, and that when that report was accepted supplies would be stopped, and the Commission would die. That was either an act of treachery or an act of conspiracy, but such was the information conveyed to me unsought. I knew that the gentleman who told me could not have made it up, but must have learnt it from an inner circle. Being on my guard, and feeling that probably the Government, in their resentment against me for taking the action I did, were determined to prevent me from carrying out the object I had in view, I immediately reviewed the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission, mid wrote to the then Prime Minister, the honorable member for Ballarat, a strong protest against the  chairman  who had been selected. I also wrote a letter in protest against the secretary who had been nominated. He - and I say this in the light of nil the evidence that has been taken-had been one of the chief mischief-makers in the centre of trouble in New South Wales. For that reason T felt that he was not entitled to be there, and I intimated to the Commission that if he remained secretary I would not remain a member. The result was that bv the next sitting that secretary had gone. However, we still had the  chairman.  We mk preliminary evidence in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. We returned to Melbourne while the House was sitting, and went on with our work. It was while we were sitting in Melbourne that the second bomb-shell was hurled into the camp. It came from the  chairman  of the Commission, who brought forward, without instruction by the Commission, without consideration by the Commission, and without consulting the Commission, the prophesied " financial report." He threw this document, which he called a report, on the table, and his mandate was that the Commission must consider it. When he told me that it was a report on the financial position of the service, my hair positively stood on end. I said, " A report on the financial position of the service, when we have examined only one accountant out of seven ; when we have hardly more than scratched the surface of the question of the finances !" That question could not possibly have been reported upon at that stage, and the position became ridiculous in the extreme. I told him that so far from considering the report, as he called it, I would not even read it. I knew that it was an imposition, and, unfortunately, in keeping with the warning I had received in the early days of the Commission. The  chairman  sought to force the document through the Commission, but that body decided, after some trouble, to postpone its consideration until we met in Hobart, after the session closed. Before the House rose, however, something happened. The Government went out, and when we got to Hobart the report went out, too. Then the second trump card was played by these gentlemen. It was the resignation of three members of the Commission. That was looked upon as the death-blow of the Commission, and it would have been to most bodies of that kind. It was not fatal to this Commission, however, because there remained on it some members who were desirous of going through with the task they had undertaken. Those three men resigned, and what is more - I am going to state it, although it may hurt when they reached the mainland from Tasmania, the  chairman  made it his business to go to the Governor-General and appeal to him to end the life of the Commission. Had it not been for the ex-member for Dalley, who happened to be in Melbourne at the time, also going to the Governor-General and stating the case, the Commission would have lived no longer. When the Governor-General heard, the case from the man who had gone on the Commission honestly to carry out his duties, and at once decided that the inquiry must proceed. And it did proceed, with four members, the ex-member for Dalley being elected  chairman.  Our troubles, however, were not at an end, for we were castigated by the press, and subjected to never-ending humiliation at the instance of newspapers all over the country. Day after day, and week after week, we were attacked; and never in history was there so consolidated an attempt to wipe out of existence a Commission appointed by the highest tribunal of the country. Then, having gone through all this, our position was made still harder by the knowledge that, of the Commissioners, there were at least two who would have ended the Commission. Actuated largely by their personal interests and their vanity, they struggled to take action of a character which, but for the casting vote of the  chairman,  on more than one occasion, would have thwarted us in carrying out the duties with which we had been charged. Altogether, it will be seen that we had a hard and thorny road to travel. As  I  have said, we had the press against us, and country newspapers were invited to publish articles manufactured in Melbourne, behind which step there was, it was strongly suspected, a prominent officer. Not only had we internal troubles, but we had to face cold treatment from honorable members of this House, who, at least, should have given the Commission credit for trying to perform their high duties. We had a hard task to perform, involving great concentration of thought and effort; but we were ridiculed and calumniated on every hand by those who knew better, but who had the power. Our path was strewn with difficulties such as have beset no Royal Commission in the history of the Commonwealth or the States. </para>
                <para>I congratulate this and other Governments on the way in which they have followed the chart laid down on an ocean that had had no chart before - the chart laid down by the Postal Commission. When the Commission was appointed, there was nothing to guide a Postmaster-General as to what was best for the emancipation of the service. Since that time, however, previous Governments to a degree, and the present Government to a greater degree, have had this chart at their command ; and I congratulate, not only .the Minister, but the departmental officials, and the Public Service Commissioner, on having so largely adopted it for their guidance. While, however, I make this acknowledgment for the way in which the ship has been prevented from striking the rocks, and brought into somewhat more placid waters, I cannot compliment them on having adopted suggestions without any acknowledgment or recognition of their indebtedness to the Commission. In the outside world such action would be regarded as piracy or plagiarism; but here it seems to be a virtue. What I have stated in this connexion is a fact, and it is no use pretending otherwise. That fact should be stated, though not for my benefit; for, after I have made my speech and performed my task to the bitter end - having clone what I believe to be my duty - I care nothing for what politics may offer me. </para>
                <para>I  desire now to pass from this rather unpleasant part of the history of the Commission, and to deal with the great Postal Service itself. This is the greatest public service in Australia, involving an expenditure of nearly £4,000,000 per annum. This Department is acknowledged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> to be of greater magnitude than any railway service. Its ramifications enter into the life of every man, woman, and child in this country, and into their relations with their brethren in other parts of the world. Yet all along the line, from the days of State control onwards, this great Department has been made" the plaything of Governments. There has always been an idea that the man who was unfit for any other office, was fit for the position of Postmaster-General. I have looked through the history of the Postmasters-General of Australia ; but I do not desire  to  mention them in detail. In South Australia there was, at one time, an up-to-date Postmaster-General, and the results of his administration are still to be seen. In no other State, however, can we point to any Postmaster-General who has been instrumental in redeeming the decadent service of which he had the honour to be the head. In the Commonwealth there has been the same old story. From the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> our first Postmaster-General, we have had men appointed who have never given any serious portion of their lives to the consideration of the vital issues that underlie the success of such a Department. We have had eleven Postmasters-General in eleven years. I have endeavoured - and I say this with all humility - to master the great problem, and to grasp it to its very roots. This has taken me four years during which neither I nor my wife has had a holiday. Honorable members will understand, therefore, why I am pleased to be now nearing the end of my tribulation. We have had Postmaster- General after Postmaster-General; but, as a matter of fact, there is no manager of this great </para>
                <para class="block">Public Service. The Minister of course, is supposed to take the place of a manager ; but I care not how able, adaptive, or industrious a man may be, he has no time, in administering a Department of this kind, to study the great problem as it ought to be studied. It has been proved again and again that the Postmaster-General is merely the instrument of the official heads, and is, therefore, liable to continue conditions that have been our bane for years. </para>

What business concern in the whole civilized world, doing £4,000,000 worth of business per annum, could we find conducted without a manager? What business house, with great branches like that of the Post Office, would dream of leaving the control to one manager, when there is work enough, and probably more than could be grasped by three of the ablest administrators, organizers, or financial geniuses that could be obtained in any part of the world ? The present method is like taking a man from the stokehold, putting him on the bridge, and expecting him to navigate the vessel., I desire honorable members to note particularly what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> said when he gave his evidence before the Commission. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> unfortunately, is one who can read the political barometer with more precision than any man I know in this country, as is shown by what has taken place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> when giving his evidence, said, " I blame the system " ; but when he was asked who was responsible, he replied, " I do not know." When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was examined, he also said the troubles were due to the system, the responsibility for which he placed on the  Deputy  Postmasters- General and the Central Office. When we asked the  Deputy  Postmaster-General and the Central Office who was responsible for the troubles, they said, " The Public Service Commissioner." When we asked subordinate officers who was responsible, they blamed first one, and then another. It mattered not how we tried to get at the cause of the trouble, the responsibility was always transferred. All we heard was that it was the system that was at fault. To show that I am not unfairly treating the Public Service Com missioner, let me refer honorable members to questions 48891-2-3. </para>

                    cannot say who is the author of the system. Evidently, it had no author, but grew, and was growing until the intervention of the Postal Commission. The Public Service Commissioner-,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline>
                    and other prominent officials, sheltered themselves behind the system. I ask honorable members to pay particular attention to the evidence of the Public Service Commissioner, especially in view of his criticism of the Postal Commission's report. He was permitted to read all the evidence, and to call to his assistance his inspectors, and was made the last witness, that he might be in a position to reply to everything. When examined on the 25th November, 1909, he read a statement which, being tendered after he had been sworn, became his evidence. In this statement, dealing with postal assistants, he said -
                </para><quote>
                    <para>Under the Commonwealth classification postal assistants are in a much better position; they commence at a salary of <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> at 18 years of age, and advance to a maximum of <inline font-style="italic">£150</inline> per annum, which, in view of the nature of the work performed, is fair remuneration for the service rendered. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">He has since stated that it is not fair remuneration. Again, referring to clerical assistants, he said : - </para><quote>
                    <para>Under the State, when performing similar duties, they could only have advanced by annual increments of <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">£15</inline> to £125, whereas under the Commonwealth, they have advanced by ;£'2o increments to <inline font-style="italic">£160,</inline> and many of them have received long service increments to £170. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">Not only did the Commissioner consider that the clerical assistants received the remuneration to which they were entitled by reason of their services, but he upheld the rates and conditions of the sorters. Since then he has shown his readiness to adjust his sails to the breezes that blow, and by a so-called re-classification has taken away the barrier between the junior and senior sorters. Formerly a junior sorter could not become a senior sorter until he had passed a difficult test, but the test is now dispensed with, and junior sorters can rise to be senior sorters, and to a maximum salary of £180 a year. At the same time, however, the position of despatching officer has been abolished, these men being made senior sorters. As despatching officers was a position created by the Public Service Commissioner himself, with a view to the recognition of superior service, they were entitled to receive £200 a year, but as senior sorters, they cannot get more than £180 a year. The Commissioner has made this change with a view to placating the larger number, and to re-establish his popularity with the service, for whose troubles lie is chiefly responsible. Dealing further with the sorters - page 2299, the Commissioner said : - </para><quote>
                    <para>It  must -be recognised that the conditions of  the  sorting class in every State have been considerably improved since Federation, ,and that  no  warrant exists for conferring further advantages upon these officers. </para>

                    Commissioner realizes th? need for trimming his sails again, and acknowledges the justice of the case presented on behalf of the sorters. I would point out that the tree which figured in one of his reports some time ago, to show that every man in the service could climb from the foot to the topmost branches, has fallen. Its every branch has been lopped off. When the Commission began its work, the maximum salary of a letter-carrier was £138 a year, and men could rise from that position to become junior sorters, with a minimum of £144 a year. The sorters to-day are still at a minimum of £144 per annum, while the letter-carriers have a maximum of £156 per annum. Therefore, a letter carrier who becomes a sorter will receive a lower salary.

                        <para>- " Engineering " more correctly describes the process. The Public Service Commissioner has left one weak link in his re-modelling of the service. The evidence given by the sorters regarding the conditions existing in New Zealand was largely contradicted by him in a circular which he issued ; but the officers of the Department published another circular, in which they established their position by showing the exact conditions that exist in New Zealand under the recent classification. That, of course, was not palatable to the gentleman who had so assiduously endeavoured to make it appear that they had misrepresented their case before the Commission. I do not know whether that is why the sorters have been picked out for special treatment, but, save for a slight advantage gained by the juniors, the sorters as a body have secured less recognition than other classes. The scale of wages paid to sorters in New Zealand is as follows: - In Grade 3, the sorters rise from £110 to £140 by three yearly increments of £1° each ; in Grade 2, their salaries increase from £150 to £170 by two annual increments of £10 each; in Grade 1, the salaries are increased from £180 to £200 by two annual increments of £10 each; and the despatch clerks rise from £200 to £220 by two annual increments of £10 each. That is the scale under the classification scheme of 1908. An attempt was made to lead the public to believe that the men had not faithfully presented their case when before the Commission; but, by the production of these, the actual facts, they have now established their position. This scale shows that a sorter in New Zealand is allowed to receive up to £180 per annum, and that, on becoming a despatch clerk, he may receive up to £220 per annum. The Commissioner declared that the postal assistants of Australia were well paid when their maximum pay was £150 per annum. Even that was not the maximum when we commenced our inquiries, but as soon as the Public Service Commissioner saw that the evidence pointed strongly to the inadequacy of the salaries of these men he raised the then existing maximum, not by annual, but by long service, increments, extending over twelve years, at the rate of £6 per six year period. In that way he got rid of what I described as the sweating rates that prevailed in 1907. Postal assistants, according to the Public Service Commissioner, were worth only £138 per annum in 1907 ; but in 1908 they were worth £150 a year, and to-day they are worth even more, since he has raised the maximum to £168. He now indicates that he proposes to grade them, and to provide for a maximum salary of .£180. If a postal assistant is entitled to a maximum of £180 per annum, surely no one can say that the sorters are being adequately rewarded ! Many men do not fully realize what the work of a sorter involves. A good many people regard it as comparatively easy. They may be surprised to learn, however, that a sorter in New South Wales, for instance, must carry in his mind something like  4,000  postal addresses, and that he must be able to sort at a given rate without more than  2  per cent. of errors. If the percentage of errors is continuously greater he receives a black mark. The work is certainly most strenuous. </para>

                        <para>- They were formerly regarded as sorters, but the Commissioner has improved their position - on the recommendation of the Commission, I presume - and they are now known as senior sorters.

                    <para>It cannot be said that these officers are inadequately paid at existing rates . . . and there is no justification for any further concession. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">That statement was made prior to the report of the Commission being issued. At that time the letter-carriers were receiving  £138  per annum, with increments; but today their salary is fixed at £156 per annum. The Commission recommended a payment of£150 per annum, but the Commissioner went one better. He displays a tendency to go either a little above or a little below our recommendations, the object evidently being to show that he is taking independent action. Let us look for a moment at what he has done in the Telegraph Branch. He contended that his proportional grading system was perfect, and that it was the only way in which each man could be allocated a fair reward for the services he rendered. When he saw the storm clouds gathering, however, what did he do? He abolished the plan on which he had sought to work that particular branch of the service, and introduced another system more in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission. Nevertheless, in evidence given by him before he knew what we were going to report, he contended that the proportional grading system was all that could be desired, and that the officers working under it were properly and fully rewarded. We recommended that those officers in the fifth class should go up to  £210  per annum. The Public Service Commissioner would not go so far, but soon after the Commission began its inquiry he, raised the remuneration from £160to£180. When we began our labours they were receiving only  . £160,  but he increased this amount to £180 by long-service increments of£10 each. Since then he has adopted a system under which they will receive, not  £210  per annum as recommended by us, but  . £200  a year. Yet he said that they were amply paid when they were getting only  £160  per annum. The Postal Commission considered that <inline font-style="italic">£210</inline> should be the maximum pay in the fifth class; the Public Service Commissioner now fixes the maximum at  £200  per annum. We also said that fourth class officers should be able to go up to  £285,  the increased pay being granted for merit alone. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> did nothing to indicate how he was going to treat the fourth class officers. The presumption is that they will be restricted, and that, as in the case of the despatch officers, the senior men will be placed at a maximum of  . £210.  And so he juggles with his classification, taking off a little bit here and adding a little there. In every case his conclusions practically refute the evidence that he gave before us when he had nothing to guide him as to what our findings would be. I come now to the linemen - the men employed in the Construction Branch - concerning whom the Public Service Commissioner said, as. reported at page  2302  of the <inline font-style="italic">Minutes of Evidence -</inline></para><quote>

                        <para>- That supports my contention that there is a necessity for a complete change of the whole system. I absolutely agree with the honorable member, but the Public Service Commissioner does not. He holds that he is the right man  in  the right place, and that he can do what the service requires. I propose now to refer to the telegraph messengers. It will be remembered that a difficulty arose in regard to the dismissal of these boys on reaching the age of eighteen. Just as they were beginning to show what they were made of, and to be of service - just as the Department was likely to reap the benefit of the training it had given these youths - they had to be discharged because of some idiotic provision in the regulations, which made it imperative that, if there was no other position available for them, they should be retired. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> in his report, stated that it had been suggested to him that the age should be extended to twenty years. Since, however, he saw the Postal Commission's report, he has not only extended the age to twenty years, but has abolished the whole arrangement, which should have been abolished years before, and the Department is now at liberty to secure the services of the boys that it trains, and keep them to fill positions which, to a large extent, had been left unfilled in days gone by. </para>

We cannot do anything even by legislation without consulting the Public Service Commissioner, because he is the " boss of the show," and we must obey him or, at least, consult bini.

Such a staff was most necessary, but was most scandalously neglected, particularly in New South Wales.

                        <para>- Yes, to this extent, that a relieving staff of so many officers of a certain grade has been proposed, high grade officers relieving in high grade post-offices, second grade in second grade, and so on. Therefore, what the Public Service Commissioner said, before he knew what the Commission's report was going to be, was preposterous, is practically, although not perhaps wholly, adopted by him and those who are administering the Department to-day. The Public Service Commissioner then went on to indicate the system whereby the selection of officers was achieved under the Public Service <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> He said the system was perfect, that there had never been any trouble about the officers who had been allocated positions by him, and quoted Queensland as an example. He said that in that State some men were sought by the Chief Officer to be put in a superior position, which he claimed they were not entitled to, and which the subsequent permanent  Deputy  Postmaster-General also decided that they were not entitled to. He used that as an illustration of the fact that the recommendations of the then  Deputy  Postmaster-General were not reliable, but he did not mention the fact that subsequently, when things began to mould themselves into shape, practically all of those men who had been denied promotion were given promotion by the very same  Deputy  Postmaster-General. The recommendation of the Public Service Inspector, on which the denial of the promotion was based, was negatived only when the  Deputy  Postmaster-General fully realized the quality of the staff upon which he had to rely in the carrying out of his duties. </para>

                </continue><para>I come now to something which will be rather a surprise to the House and the country. The Commission made 175 recommendations. Of these, 130 have a reasonable chance of being adopted. One hundred and three have already been adopted. Eight of the remainder deal with matters which come within the purview of the Minister of Home Affairs, who has apparently not yet decided what he is going to do about them. They deal with improved buildings, improved sanitation and ventilation, improved designs for country buildings, and specifications that will be more uniform and in keeping with modern requirements. Three of the recommendations affect matters under the control of the Treasurer. One of these is to the effect that the deficit of  £2,300,000,  which was the result of the first six years of Federal control of postal administration - a deficit arrived at by an honest comparison of receipts and charges - should be wiped off, because there is no hope of it ever being met in any other way. </para><interjection>

I admit that we inherited some disabilities from the States, which, with the exception of South Australia, shirked their responsibilities prior to Federation, knowing that the postal services were to pass under Federal control. Maintenance and construction were allowed to fall behind; but, whilst that was the state of affairs when we took the service over, practically the same condition was still in existence when the Commission began to make its inquiries. There was, therefore, no set off that could be allowed for a service that was no better after six years of Federal administration. </para>

There are three other recommendations towards which, the Government are favorably disposed, and there are thirty-four which have not been agreed to. Of those thirty-four some are not indispensable, although it seemed to the Commission that they would be useful if adopted. One of them was that officers should be compelled to liquidate the just claims of their creditors. I presume that the Government and the Department and the Public Service Commissioner do not think that is a fair proposition, and, therefore, have not adopted it. Another was that all staff matters be placed  in  charge of a staff- committee. That,  of  course, comes under the heading of the Board of Management, and, therefore,  is not  adopted, because the Board of Management idea has not yet been adopted. </para><interjection>

We also recommended that the right of appeal be preserved to officers, and a departmental arbitrator appointed to deal with appeals. We recommended that tea money be abolished, and extra services be paid for. That has not been wholly adopted, but the conditions in that regard have been materially improved by the Public Service Commissioner since then. No fewer than  134  of our recommendations have been adopted, or are under consideration. When the Hobhouse Commission  inquired  into the position of the employe's  in the  British Post Office there was no hesitation on the part of the British Postmaster-General in immediately showing his appreciation of the work which had been done by the members of that Commission. As soon as he had read the Report, which did not take him long, he came down to the House of Commons, and, although it  involved  an expenditure of  £1,000,000,  he at once moved its adoption. He did not give a crumb here and a crumb there, but he- told the House that the Commissioners had done work which entitled them to recognition and appreciation; and the Report was adopted by Parliament in less time than it has taken the Commonwealth Government to consider some of the more simple issues raised. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly the Government were watching the Commission very closely ; there never was a busier time in the Department, the office of the Public Service Commissioner, or the office of the Minister. Let me relate one little incident to prove my case. The immaculate ex-member for North Sydney, in  1910,  came, with the honorable member for Ballarat, to defeat me in my electorate if he could. This immaculate ex-member on the platform gave a typical reason why I should not be returned. He told the electors that it was not necessary to return me to Parliament to produce or deal with the report of the Postal Commission, because the Government, he said, were " picking the eyes" out of it as the evidence was given, and by the time Parliament met there would be nothing left to report on. These were the tactics used by a member of the Government which preceded the present Government. When we find a gentleman like the ex-member for North Sydney, whom we would never credit with stooping </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister made a statement to that effect in the House some time ago. If the Opposition will not agree to my proposition, the position will be that the House will resolve itself into Committee of Supply, and, on the Estimates relating to the Postmaster-General's Department, the honorable member for Gwydir will be able to complete his speech. I would suggest, however, that, in the special circumstances, leave be given for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I am prepared to move that they be suspended. </para>

                <para class="block">That is one of the great innovations that have been made in the Department to the advantage of the public. Some people may think that the Commission's inquiry has had to do largely with the welfare of the Postal service itself,, but it has been of equal interest and benefit to the public whom the Department serves. In no case has greater relief been given to the public than by the introduction of Wheatstone instruments into the Telegraphic Branch. Formerly, on congested lines, the public had to pay double rates to get their messages through; but now the introduction of the Wheatstone instruments enables the business to be done more rapidly, and the public are assured of a reasonable service at the ordinary rates. Strange to say, when the Commission were inquiring into the matter, there was an obsolete Wheatstone apparatus lying idle in the Sydney General Post Office. No one seemed to care whether it was worked or not, or to be aware of its advantages. There was only one Wheatstone operator, and he was the only expert, in the whole Commonwealth. He was stationed in Western Australia. He has since been appointed teacher of Wheatstone operating, and is travelling through the States instructing the staff. The public are benefited by practically every recommendation in the report, even by those which relate most closely to the service, because, if a service feels that it is justly rewarded for its labours, the public are bound to receive better attention and better results  - </para>

                <para class="block">This also is of great benefit to the public. In country districts, previously, the telephone exchanges were stuck in any corner of the big offices ; and this, and the obsolete character of the appliances, all militated against a good service being given to the public. By having separate telephone exchanges with modern switchboards, proper attention can be given to those who use the telephones. Therefore, as distinct from the benefits to the service itself, the public come in all the time - </para>

                <para class="block">Imagine a great Department like this, spending £4,000,000 a year, and having no uniform system of accounts 1 When we had the Accountant of the Service before the Commission, we asked him to give us an indication of the revenue and expenditure in the three main branches of the Service, and business men will marvel when I say that the reply we received was: " I cannot do it. The Department has never kept separate accounts, and, therefore, no information on that vital point can be given to the Commission, nor could any information be given for the guidance of the various Ministers who have had charge of the Department." Such a condition of affairs is almost unthinkable. Nevertheless it was a fact; but since that time an accountant, who, I believe, is a capable officer, has been appointed, and he is now doing things which ought to have been done from the beginning of Commonwealth administration. </para>

We found, in the Stores Branch, a lack of system and method in bookkeeping, stocktaking, and the checking of stores. In every State there was a hybrid system, which was practically no protection to the revenue; and there was .consequently a. loophole left for manipulation at any time by the men employed. As a matter of fact, in Western Australia, one employe, without being detected, took enough copper wire from the departmental stores to fence his selection. He was not found out until the investigations of the Postal Commission caused the officials to make some inquiry, and they discovered that many pounds' worth of material had been purloined over many months. This case shows the loose system that prevailed all through the service ; and but for the honesty of the men generally, the Commonwealth would have suffered to a much greater degree.

Here was a Department spending £4,000,000 per annum, and yet there was no classification of the revenue and expenditure. There was no means of ascertaining the financial position of the Department; and even to-day there is no such record. There have been two Committees - a Committee of experts and a Committee appointed by the previous Government - and each has been condemned by the Public Service Commissioner as ineffective, and as entailing an absolute waste of public money. Both Committees have issued reports, but these have proved not worth the paper on which they are written. Instructions have been issued to classify the revenue and expenditure. A public accountant from a railway service has been appointed chief accountant of the Commonwealth; and, although he has been at his work for nearly twelve months, there is no result as yet. He is, however, I believe, getting the system into order; he is laying the foundations of a system ; but even now as  I  say there is no result showing the actual expenditure and revenue. Can we imagine a Public Service Commissioner, or a Minister, without any <inline font-style="italic">guiding star to</inline> the financial situation ? Such a state of affairs  is  unbelievable to the ordinary commercial or business man; and yet neither the Minister nor the Treasurer to-day can ascertain to what extent each branch of the service is paying, or is not paying - </para>

Previously, however, if an officer died before he obtained the furlough to which he was entitled, there was no means of handing over an equivalent to those dependent on him. I find that the payment depends on the recommendation of the Permanent Head and the certificate of the Public Service Commissioner; but a new scale has been adopted, and the recommendation of the Permanent Head eliminated, it being now left to the Chief Officer to say whether the furlough shall be paid for. Indeed, more has been done; because, in the case of death, an equivalent will be paid to those dependent on the deceased officer. Thus, some degree of justice has been done in a manner which common sense and equity dictate. </para>

In England, an increase is given without seniority being attained or an examination passed. At twenty-three, a man obtains an increase because he ought to have undertaken additional responsibilities of citizenship. I was anxious that the principle should be recognised here. The Commissioner regards the married man as a more useful officer than a single man. Therefore, to secure a good service, marriage should be encouraged. Formerly, a person who had been in the service for three years, and had attained the age of twenty-one, received a minimum' wage of  ,£110;  but now the minimum is  .£126  on attaining the age of twenty-one, without regard to length of service- - </para>

It is now recognised that, not only the staff, but the supervising officers, are entitled to justice at the hands of the administration. These constitute the changes that have been made in what the Public Service Commissioner declared to be a -perfect service, so far as administration was concerned. I do not mean to suggest that he said that everything was perfect ; but it was difficult to get him to admit that there were any imperfections. If he did make an admission of the kind, he usually qualified it with the statement, " If the position is not what it ought to be, it is certainly better than it was under the State <inline font-style="italic">regime."</inline> He would then endeavour to prove his contention by bringing to his assistance the exploded theory of averages. The Commissioner's resort to the theory of averages to support the excellence of his administration, as compared with the condition of affairs in are- Federation days, provides an. amusing study. I come now to his classification scheme. I have already quoted opinions expressed by the Public Service Commissioner when being examined on oath before the Commission, as to the wages that prevailed in the several branches of the service. I am now going to read what is reported to me by the Department as to the changes he has made - changes that are altogether out of keeping with the statements which he made on oath. Let it be remembered that those statements were made, not in the early days of the Commission, but in November,  1909.  The Public Service Commissioner was the last witness to be examined. We adopted that course, in order that he might have die last word on the subject. In the first place, he has fixed the minimum salary of the fifth class at <inline font-style="italic">£60,</inline> instead of <inline font-style="italic">£40,</inline> and the maximum; has been raised from  £160  to  £180.  The latest proposal is to adopt the Commission's recommendation and to raise the fifth class of the clerical branch of the service up u&gt;  £200  a year. That is the decision of the Commissioner. I take it that it will be adopted by the Government, and that  .£200  a year will in future be the maximum. It is worthy of note that the proposal agrees with the recommendation made by the Commission, which considered that  £200  would: be an equitable return for the services of diligent and deserving officers in this class. </para>
                    <para>Postmasters, Grades XIV. and XV., fixed salaries of ;£i20 and <inline font-style="italic">£140,</inline> abolished ; and postmasters in Class V. permitted to advance to £180. Proposed further increase of maximum to £200. </para>
                    <para class="block">The salaries of postmasters are also to be increased. Another change made is - </para>

                    <para class="block">I was astonished to find that there were no less than twelve grades of postmasters. Since the cost of conveying every postmaster to a new position has to be borne by the Department, one could not help wondering why an administrator should have seen fit to fix upon no less than twelve grades. The Commissioner, however, has now seen the error of his ways, and has reduced the number to six. The Commission recommended that the number should be reduced to five, and the Commissioner has gone as near as possible to our recommendation without actually adopting it. Con»- ing to the telegraphists, we find that the maximum of the fifth class has been amended as in the Clerical Division, by being increased to £200 per annum. The Postal Commission recommended that the maximum of that class should be £210. Further changes made by the Commissioner are - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It will thus be seen that the General Division are to come up from the original maximum of £138 a year in 1907, to £168 per annum. According to a paragraph in the newspapers, it would also appear that the maximum salary of assistants is to be increased to £180, as provided for in Grade 7, Regulation 104, which applies to senior sorters and senior mechanics. The jack-of-all-trades in the Department, who had very few to speak for him on the Commission because of his isolation - the man who could not marshall his evidence owing to want of organization - is, therefore, to get a fair deal. The salary of £180 a year is in excess of our recommendation. We recommended that it should be £150; but we certainly indicated that the duties of these officers were very varied, and that there should be some classification for them. Some of these men rank next to postmasters; they do telegraphic work, and possibly counter and financial work, and are, therefore, more valuable to the Commonwealth than others who discharge merely routine duties - </para>

                    <para class="block">We have here a wholesale adoption of the recommendations of the Commission. After reviewing the evidence given by the Commissioner, one cannot but marvel" at the way in which he is able to accommodate himself to conditions existing from time to time, and brought about either by the Government of the day or by the political winds that happen to be blowing. I say without hesitation that if ever a man displayed a remarkable aptitude for adjusting himself to conditions that  appeared to be most popular, and popularizing himself with the service when he saw that there was no alternative, that man is the Public Service Commissioner. These linemen have got practically all that we recommended, and that which he said would not be warranted. Line foremen have been granted a maximum of £180 instead of £162. while other changes are - </para>

One would have thought that the Commissioner was engaged in grading butter, having regard to the many grades that he set up in each division. They were set up, apparently, to prevent officers getting too far ahead. Many of these barriers have been removed under this readiustment, and even proportional grading has become a thing of the past. Men may now advance, as recommended by the Royal Commission, according to merit - </para>

                <para class="block">I would rather have handed all those details to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> than have read them in full, but it was necessary for me to read them in order to put them on record, and have them published, so that all those interested may see what is being done, why it is being done, and how it is being done. I have not had an estimate made, but I should think that the difference between the rewards given to the service under this so-called new classification, or as I would rather call it the breaking down of the old classification, and the pay previously given to the service, must be at least  £250,000  per annum. To that extent the Postal Service benefits. If the pay now given on the Public Service 'Commissioner's own classification, based on our report, is a fair reward for the services rendered, what must the position of the service have been before attention was drawn to it by constant agitation in the course of the Commission's inquiry? The service must have been absolutely sweated in those days ; but the Public Service Commissioner turned round and said that " Of course they did not do anything, because they were waiting for the Postal Commission's report." He practically belied that statement in his own evidence, when he said, on oath, that these increases were not warranted, and that the additional money would not be earned. Now that the service benefits to that extent even by the concessions that have already been made, they ought, I think, to be much more contented and energetic. Now that they have a chance of advancing by merit, the men and women in the service ought to work to achieve the best results possible, and to give the public the very best services that are in them. Apart from the question of salaries, look at the changes which the Public Service Commissioner has made in the administration. I have not yet dealt with organization, because that fits in with the more vital question of control and management, and when we come to consider the changes in organization, as well as the other changes, absolutely not a shadow of the old conditions - not enough even to identify them - is left. Those old conditions were the outcome of nine years' efforts at administration by this public servant. If his system, his methods, his rewards, his classification, his grading are now all thrown to the winds, I would like to know what there is left standing to the credit of his reputation as an administrator of the affairs of a great service of this kind. The Public Service Commissioner says, and his Inspectors repeat it, for they evidently all learn the same tune, that the Public Service Inspectors are best qualified to judge the merits of the services rendered  by any officer in the Department. I admit that after a thing is produced it is easy for a man to justify his position as a critic by altering some little detail, just as the Commissioner has altered his programme in this case to make it appear that he is omnipotent in this Department. In the first classification on which the Postal Service was based, the men were classified, and had the right of appeal to an Appeal Board, but they had to appear in person. They had no one to represent them. I do not mean to say that the Board treated them badly, or did not try to help them, but in any large body of men there are hound to be some nervous individuals who cannot put their own cases properly, and they would be liable to have their appeals cast out by reason of that infirmity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> the Public Service Inspector, told us that he inspected the work of every man in the service in New South Wales before that first classification was made, and in spite of the disability under which those who appealed laboured, no fewer than 33 per cent, of the appeals were allowed by the Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was therefore wrong in one out of every three cases, and probably the proportion would have risen to one in two if all the men had been able to put their cases before the Board as they should. If that gentleman, after watching and inspecting the work of every officer, as he said he did, could not arrive closer to a just decision than that, he cannot be as well qualified to judge the value of the services of the officers as the head of a Department or the heads of branches would be if they were properly qualified to occupy those positions. There is therefore a duplication of work, and a duplication of expense, in that regard, without any corresponding advantage to the Department or to the country. Let us take the case of a senior Public Service Inspector of New South Wales. I wish to illustrate what has been the result of this magnificent reign of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> McLachlan, our Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- lt is not under my control at all, but I am pleased to say that I have had something to do with relieving both the general public and the service itself from what would have been a very unfortunate position had things been allowed to continue in the old way. Let us now look at the system and what it has produced. Here we have a Public Service Inspector, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> dealing with some of the leading officers who climbed to the top of the tree under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> system of promotion. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was examined about the qualifications of one officer to take up the position of senior postal inspector, he . gave certain evidence which I shall quote. There is an anomaly in the State of New South Wales. That large State is subdivided into a number of districts, in which inspectors have to do the work of supervising the services of the officers of the Department. The most remarkable feature of this administrative system is that there is no connexion between the metropolitan area and the country districts, although the interests and the work of both are interdependent. The metropolitan area is under a senior inspector, and the country is run under individual inspectors. How uniformity of administration or action is to be obtained under such conditions is a problem which the Commission could not solve. The witness was asked with regard to that officer - </para>

                <para class="block">Therefore, the gentleman who had control of the Public Service in New South Wales, and who was responsible for making the machinery work smoothly, said that a certain officer had no control, but should have, and was " the best man. available ! " In other words, it means that the officer was the best of a bad lot ; and this is the result of years of administration under the supposed refined system of advancement - that instituted by the Commissioner. Now we come to question 47875, which shows how  the service is run, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> - </para>

                    knows what ought to be done, and he thinks it ought to be done, and yet it is not done. That is the system under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, the Central Office, and the  Deputy  Postmasters-General ; and while we have a man with power and no responsibility, we cannot escape results of the kind. The Commissioner is prepared to appoint officers, but evidently he is unable to see that the officers are put to duties which they can discharge effectively. Yet we are told that we have to speak in an undertone when we refer to the Commissioner and those associated with him. Questions 48116 and 48117 and 481 18 deal with the absence of power to remedy anomalies -

                    <para>Xs there a disability owing to dual control as between the promotion of the staff as laid down by the Commissioner and the administration of the Department? - I think I have called attention to the fact that, although the Commissioner or his inspectors may direct attention to anomalies in the working of a Department, the_ Commissioner has no power to enforce a rectification of those anomalies, but he can refuse to grade a staff, or to supply additional staff, even though it be desired by a branch of the Department. </para>
                    <para>Do you consider that a weakness in the Commonwealth Public Service Act?- Yes. </para>
                    <para>Have you any means of overcoming it? - The only means would be to amend the law, so as to give the Commissioner power of enforcing something he regarded as necessary. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Here we have men in wrong positions, who are not giving the country their best services; and yet there is no power to make a change in the interests of the public. When we have regard to the type of officers produced under the old order, we cease to wonder at the results. I notice that the Public Service Commissioner complains in his report that the Royal Commission cut short his examination. I wish to tell the House, however, that the Public Service Commissioner had eighteen months' or two years' notice, and was permitted to make his statement in writing. He was supposed to give us the best in him, and he had months in which to prepare, with the help and advice of his inspectors. He had the evidence Pf every witness before him.; and his statement occupied eighteen and a half pages of closely-printed material ; yet he complains now that there were lots of things he intended to say, and which he had no opportunity to say. I may remark that I myself had him under examination for eight hours, and then I had not finished. The Commissioners did agree to meet again, and resume the evidence by the Public Service Commissioner, but that was in 1 9 10, when we had to go to face the electors. Two of the Commissioners did not come back to Parliament, though two did ; and, in any case, the newspapers, Parliament, and people generally began to demand our report. Some of my comrades must have been frightened, for they decided not to continue, on the ground that the written statement of the Public Service Commissioner ought to contain all he had to say. That is why that gentleman's examination was not resumed. If he had anything "up his sleeve" - and he implied he had - it was not creditable on his part to keep it there when he had a chance to put it into his statement. If he was merely waiting for an inspiration from somebody else as to what he ought to say or do, he was evading his responsibility as a witness before the Commission. Yet the Commissioner complains in his report, which I have described as " lamentations and apologies," that his examination was cut short. The Public Service Commissioner is the greatest man at reporting I ever knew, and his reports are marvellous in their construction. One thing stands out prominently in them, namely, that Duncan McLachlan is always on top ; that everything he does is right, or, if it is not, it is better than is done in the States, and, therefore, every one ought to be satisfied. As to the opinion of the Public Service Commissioner and his Inspectors, who say that they can judge what an  officer is, I read the following evidence on page 23.11 - </para>

                <para>This is the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> who fixes the salaries, and who says he gets his knowledge only from papers supplied. </para>

                <para class="block">But the Department evidently had not a better man, or he would be known to the Public Service Commissioner, who is responsible for the advancement of officers.

                <para class="block">This officer apparently gets along somehow, although the Commissioner is convinced that a better man should fill the position.

                    who is a technical man, and, I admit, of high attainments, said in his evidence that it is essential to the proper working of a telephone exchange that the manager shall have technical knowledge; and in one case we found a manager so qualified, and his exchange and its administration were a great improvement on what was found under other conditions. Why did the Public Service Commissioner not get a better man ? We may assume that the service could not produce one. Here is another, and, perhaps, the most heartrending instance of a general state of inefficiency. It is shown in question and answer No. 48971 -

                        <para>- I have not made him the only judge; this Parliament did so when it placed the service under his domination. To show how hopeless is the state into which the system has drifted, and how poor are the products which the gardener has reared after years of cultivation, I instance the fact that, when a new  Deputy  Postmaster-General was needed for Western Australia recently, on the retirement of the former occupant of the office, the Commissioner had to go down several grades to get him. The next man to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in each State is the Chief  Clerk,  who is supposed to be the understudy of his chief, and capable to act as substitute when the chief is on leave, or otherwise absent. Next in rank to the Chief Clerks come the Chief Accountants, and then the Chief Electrical Engineers. The Western Australian position could not be filled by any of the Chief Clerks, by any of the Chief Accountants, by any of the Chief Electrical Engineers, or by any of the Mail Branch Managers. The Commissioner had to take the Assistant Mail Manager in New South Wales, who was getting a salary of about  £360, and promote him to the position at ^700. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The recommendations of the Commission are being adopted, and merit is being recognised, without regard to the tree of promotion which figured in one of the Public Service Commissioner's reports. But this case illustrates the weakness of the service. A position on the top branch having become vacant, none of the four men on the second branch was capable of filling it, none on the third, fourth, or fifth. It was not until the sixth branch was reached that a capable man was found. That shows how ineffective the selection of officers by the Public Service Inspectors has been. They are supposed to supervise and correct the recommendations of the Deputy Postmasters-General ; but they do not do it. We had the Chief Clerks before us. I do not wish to injure any one; but  1  have my duty to perform, and it cannot be done in kid gloves. One Chief  Clerk  came before us, and we commenced to examine him ; but he was so hopeless that we had to let him go. Nothing was to be got out of him, because there was nothing in him. He was a standing joke. In Western Australia, we found a man of similar type. As to the man in Queensland, the least said the soonest mended. He had been the head of the Staff Committee. The nearer the men are to the throne, the sooner they get the crown. This man had risen more quickly than a man in the lower ranks would ordinarily rise, and had attained a position which, in my judgment, in that of the Commission, and in that of the Commissioner and his officers, he was not capable of filling. The only Chief  Clerk  worthy of his position was the man in New South Wales. The Public Service Inspector recommended him highly for promotion; but the Department jockeyed him out of it. He is an able, honest public servant in every sense of the words, and has for years been a slave to duty, carrying the burden of administration in an acting capacity for half the time during the past five years. By reason of some influence which cannot be analyzed, he was driven, as he admitted in his evidence, to withdraw his name from an application for promotion, feeling that he would not be able to work happily with those who were hungering for it. </para>

                <para class="block">What an admission of weakness ! There is hope of improvement only when men occupying prominent positions in the various States leave the service. The Department cannot get rid of them. We found that, there was no such thing as accountancy in the service," and only one duly certificated! accountant. He was tired of his job. He made a report which, had it been acted on in the early days of Federation, would have prevented a great deal of trouble; but one accountant has no chance against so many so-called accountants who are not qualified. In the Department a man cannot rise higher than the high water mark, and if he is where the tides are low he cannot rise very high. Men have to conform to the standard set to them, and a brilliant man is crushed down, or crushed out of the service by his superior officers. Bright men who could not tolerate the system have left the service at the first opportunity, to seek better employment elsewhere. The Public Service Commissioner complained of the character of the employes in the clerical division in New South Wales in 1902 and 1903, saying that the standard was low, and the creation of the State <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> but God knows if anything could be lower than the standard produced by his <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> Although he contended that their standard was low, and that they were inefficient, he took away twenty of the brightest lads, and put them into the Customs Department, making a weak service still weaker. As  I  have mentioned, I asked the Chief Accountant whether he could tell us how the Department stood, what we owe, what we have in hand, and so on, but he could not tell us. That was three years ago, and we do not know the position now. The men in the Accountancy Branch were not fit for their work, and the service was like a ship without a rudder. The accountant should be the " king pin," the guiding star of the. administration; but in Tasmania an accountant drawing £500 a year, after submitting a statement which he swore was his own, could not tell us anything about it;  and we ultimately discovered that it was drawn up by an inferior officer, getting, about £260 a year, who was the only mar*, who could explain it. The other man fainted off, to get out of the difficulty. When you find an officer like that at the head of a Department- </para>

                        <para>- The name of the mar* who occupied this high position was Octa- "vius Lord.- One would hardly expect to\ find another case of the kind in. the course of such an inquiry ; but we did. We went to South Australia, where there was supposed to be an accountant in charge of the big financial branch of the Department. This accountant submitted to us a statement which we subsequently found had been compiled by some one else. He swore to it ; out later on could not identify any part of it. Subsequently, we had before us an officer of the Audit Department, who admitted that he had prepared every line of the statement. The man who had presented it to us as his own statement, thinking that he could bluff us, was unable to explain any part of it, and did not seem to be familiar with the simplest proposition in it ; yet he was at the head of an important "branch of the service. Is that not sufficient to prove what this system of controlling the :service by a Commissioner has produced? Is it any wonder that the Department should have occupied the position that it did in 1907 ? Unless radical changes are made, not at the bottom, but at the top of the service, we shall return again to the old state of affairs. </para>

                <para class="block">That was prior to the adoption of the Commission's recommendation by the appointment of an accountant from the railway service of Western Australia. The Commissioner admitted that he had to put in these positions men who were much too small, although bigger men were necessary. Regarding the power of the Public Service Commissioner to select officers, and the necessity for a Public Service Inspector to supervise the work of departmental officers in selecting men for different purposes, the Commissioner had a great deal to say. He urged that such powers were absolutely necessary. He always kept in front the importance of his presence on the ship, yet he admitted in answer to question 49325 that during the whole of his seven years' administration he did not think there had been twenty refusals of applications for increased staff in Sydney. Imagine the necessity of a Public Service Commissioner and a staff of officers  for the purpose of rejecting twenty cases in a State like New South Wales, where there are- nearly 5,000 officers. Twenty cases have been disallowed in seven years, and there is no proof that the Commissioner was right in all those cases. All the circumlocution and all those safeguards which he says are so necessary in the public interest, have resulted in his having to refuse the recommendations of the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of New South Wales in about twenty cases during a period of seven years. Surely that ought to be enough to convince any one that to continue that sort of service is not only unwise, but absolutely unjustifiable. In answer to another question, the Public Service Commissioner said that there was not much trouble now. The  Deputy  Postmasters-General and the Public Service Inspectors are now in almost total agreement on all questions. Is it not truly marvellous? A few years ago when there were a few vacancies for  Deputy  Postmasters-General, we had a scramble going on in the Department. We had one man cutting another man's throat, and each striving to get into favour. The result was that die recommendations of the officers then officiating were more closely scrutinized than at any other time. When the office of  Deputy  Postmaster-General of New South Wales became vacant, the Public Service Commissioner recommended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> for the position. He recommended not a man in the Department, but an officer in his own branch of the service. It was ruled by the authorities, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> could not legally occupy the office. The Public Service Commissioner was advised that he could, and possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> would have been the best man for the position, but because of this legal disability, . a worse man, according to the Commissioner, obtained it. There we have another illustration of the remarkable power which the Public Service Commissioner is able to exercise with regard to officers in his own Department. Another vacancy arose in Victoria, and again the Public Service Commissioner recommended that the position of  Deputy  Postmaster-General in this State should be filled by the then Public Service Inspector for Victoria. It was held that he could not take the position, and the result of that ruling is, according to the Commissioner, that the service secures an inferior officer for want of a merely nominal amendment of the law. I am not here to say whether or not these Public Service Inspectors would have been the most suitable officers to appoint to these positions, but I do know that the progress of a man in the Department of the PublicService Commissioner is very rapid. He is under the eye of the administrator of the service, and has a better chance of advancement than has a man in any other part of the public service. The position was the same in Queensland, under the old' staff system. I spoke about the senior inspector in New South Wales not being able to make inspections anywhere outside the metropolitan area. I may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Golding,</inline> the Electrical Construction Engineer, was also confined to the metropolitan area. We found that he had no power to control country districts which wanted? guidance and development, and that there was no continuity of supervision. The work in country districts was left to the senior lineman or any employes who chanced to be able to give details. There was no connecting link between them and the officer charged with the administration of the metropolitan area in this regard. Only recently we had in New South Wales electrical engineers who for months had no engineering work to do. They had simply to engineer a pen over a piece of paper. They were doing clerical work, and were deprived of the opportunity to develop their special knowledge, which was really lost to the Department. This is the way in which the Department has been administered as the result of the system I am now discussing. Of course, it was said that these men have grown up in the system ;. but the trouble is that they do not grow bigger. The system, we are told, will not produce bigger men, and, therefore, we have to put up with the best we can get. The Public Service Commissioner said in reply to question 49158, " I took the best that was  offered to me." That is what he always said when he found himself in a difficulty. He admitted that a particular man might not bethe best that could be produced, but he said, " The opportunity exists in the Department, but men do not rise to it." I suppose they rise to a certain standard and cannot get any higher. </para>

Those are the opinions of the two men at the top, but I was glad to find, as shown in the answer to question 49377, put by me to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> an agreement on at least one point - </para>

                    <para>On page 131 of the <inline font-style="italic">Minutes of Evidence,</inline> the following evidence was given in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young,</inline> and the overtime worked in Sydney :  - 3723. Do you not think that the Permanent Head of the Department should have made himself acquainted with the disability under which the then  Deputy  was labouring? - I think it would have been impossible. The Permanent Head is tied to his table to an even greater extent than is the  Deputy. </para>
                    <para>What is your opinion in regard to that matter? - That evidence is a corroboration of what I said all along. It is impossible for the Secretary to thoroughly do the managerial work of a large Department. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In other words, he says he is tied down, the Secretary is tied down, and the Deputy Postmaster-General is tied down. I should like to know who is loose in the Department. All those men admit that they are tied down, cannot do their work, and have no opportunity of effecting proper supervision, regulation, or organization. They plead that it is impossible for them to do, even if they are able to do it, the work which they are called upon to discharge in their positions. What a humiliating admission for men of their standing to make ! Things that are tied together do not generally agree, and those gentlemen, tied down, agree at last. </para>
                <para>I come now to the crux of this problem - the question of the management of the Department. It is marvellous how those three Scots - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan, Mr. McKay,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Scott - are interested in questions of management. The two Macs are specially in evidence, as the canny Scotsman always is when there is anything to manage at all. They agree that the present condition is absolutely impossible - that it is hopeless to expect the Department ever to succeed under the Secretary. They are both positive on that point. When asked what system should be substituted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> suggested a manager to take charge, with the Secretary under him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> also recommended a manager. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was asked if he would go to other countries for a manager, he said, "No." When asked if he thought he could find a man in Australia capable of filling the position, he said, "Yes, one." When asked who was the one, he said, " Duncan McLachlan." I do not know whether there is any family relationship between those two men, but if there is not, there ought to be, because of the kindly feeling they have towards one another when a question of advancement is at stake. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duncan</inline> McLachlan had to fill the office of  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Sydney, which was practically a steppingstone to the Secretaryship, he wanted to put in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> would subsequently become Secretary, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> would have been king of the other place. They would have managed it all between them. However, he did not get the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> said that only one man with a broad outlook was available as manager, and that was Duncan McLachlan. When we asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> whom he would recommend as manager, he said the man he had in his mind's eye as being able to do the work was not in the Postal Service, but was in the Public Service ! Of course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> has since become " the real McKay " in the Land Tax Department, and so is out of the way. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> recommends a manager for the Department, but the Royal Commission recommend the appointment of a Board of Control. We say that a Department of this kind cannot now, and never will be, effectively conducted unless there is a man at the head of each branch of the service. Let honorable members try to imagine what the Department will become in a few years with the expansion of population that we hope for. The Department now employs 20,000 permanent and temporary employes, with a population of only 4,000,000 people. Can any man say how many it will employ when we have a population of 20,000,000, which we hope to get within the next decade or two? Are we to provide only for to-day, and not for the future? Charged, as we are, with the administration of the affairs of the people, are we not bound to look ahead ? The Department is capable of expansion in many directions before it becomes equal to the Postal Services of other countries. There are many other ways in which it could meet the convenience of the public, which have not yet been attempted. If we extend its usefulness, bringing it into touch with every home in the country, carrying its ramifications through the bush and back-blocks to the isolated settlers everywhere, will it bc possible to find one man capable of managing it all? It will be enough for one man to look after the postal facilities alone. That branch of the Department alone spends between  £1,000,000  and  £2,000,000  sterling a year. No progressive American would think of running a business of  £4,000,000  a year, with three great branches, with only one manager. A man who suggested such a scheme to him would be regarded as insane. Yet in this community the Public Service Commissioner, while acknowledging all the defects of the system hitherto followed, wants to put the Department under one manager. That is an absurdity when we consider the great responsibilities involved in the administration of the Postal, Telephonic, and Telegraphic Services, with wireless telegraphy developing rapidly, and likely to become more intimately interwoven with our daily life, with telephony spreading and carrying the voice of the people to the most distant and isolated quarters, with the day of the automatic telephone at hand - a development to which we recommended in our report that keen attention should be given, and which is destined to further popularize the use of the telephone - and with all the possibilities of change and advancement that the genius of man may accomplish. Are we to leave the management of all this in the hands of a man who has had practically no experience, no training, and no knowledge of the fundamental requirements of a big Department of that kind ? We of the Postal Commission, who had no axe to grind in this matter, and gave the best of our services and intelligence practically free to the people of this country, have no object in advising the Government and Parliament to do anything but what we believe to be right. We have had far more opportunities than any of the officers of the Department in investigating the whole of the surroundings of this case. What opportunity have Postmasters-General, even if they have the capacity of giants, of grasping the magnitude of this question? Therefore, the recommendations of the Commission should have weight with the Government and the Minister. If the Minister has any respect for the members of the Commission, any regard for the evidence they took, or the conclusions they arrived at, then his duty is to pay serious attention to that all-important section of their report, namely, the Board of Control. We want, at the head of the Postal Branch, a man who is, first of all, a born organizer, a man with financial knowledge, who will see that the accounts are kept in a proper condition, who is able to handle men, and who has a general knowledge of administrative affairs. Men of that class are found in other countries, and can be found here. We want a man to take charge of the Postal Service solely. We want an expert to take charge of the great Telephonic Service and Telegraphic Service. When we get those three men, charged with the responsibilities of those three branches of this large Department, this Parliament will be able to receive their reports, and to know something of what is going on - a knowledge which it has not had in the past. They will be responsible to this Parliament, which will hold them to their trust. Having put men qualified for the duties into those positions, we shall have nothing to blame ourselves for, we shall have done the best we can to remedy the evils that we know to exist, and to bring about a lasting and beneficial reform in the great Department with which I have had the honour to deal to-night. </para>

I would not say a hard word unjustifiably against any man, but when we have an official who has given the evidence I have read, and who makes the statements he did subsequently, I am warranted in dissecting the position in the keenest way of which I am capable. This is a memorandum prepared by the Public Service Commissioner on the Postal Commission. In that memorandum the Commissioner said - </para>

He did not, however, take advantage of that opportunity, and only tells us now, when he knows what the report of the Commission contains, what was contemplated. That, in my opinion, is not straight dealing. He further says - </para>

Yet the Public Service Commissioner has the audacity to put a report like this before intelligent men. The Commission were quite willing that any suggestions that could be gathered from the evidence for the good of the service should be adopted. The Public Service Commissioner is on the horns of a dilemma ; if he did not do what ought to have been done, he neglected his duty ; and if he did it, and did not say so when he was giving his evidence, he . was deceiving the Postal Commission. Under the circumstances, there is no warrant for this report, which is an effort of the Public Service Commissioner to justify himself in the eyes of the public and of those who employ him. In the course of the report the Public Service Commissioner does what a lawyer does - he abuses the other side in order to make his own look the brighter. Every time he refers to the Postal Commission he seems to say, "It is evident they have not been able to grasp all the facts as they are exhibited in ordinary administration." It is " Duncan," and "Duncan" all the time. He practically blames the associations in the following words- </para>

Would he have liked the Commission to call each individual, and to have thus protracted their proceedings indefinitely? The Royal Commission took the course recognised in modern industrialism, and examined the officers of the associations in order to get some concrete proposition - something worthy of consideration. The Public Service Commissioner blames us for not inquiring as to the numbers in the associations. I happen to be in a position to know the numbers pretty well in every association in the Postal Service; and I do not see what right the Public Service Commissioner has to sit in judgment on me because I did not proclaim the fact from the housetops. It matters not, however, what the numbers in the associations are the witnesses called represented the men. </para>

If there is a Government in power with plenty of money to meet the demands of bad management, we, no doubt, can tide over the difficulty. But, if ever the time arrives when the Treasurer has to consider the position of the finances, we shall feel the results of present mismanagement, and discontent will once more permeate the service, as it ever must do when there is no effective control and no proper understanding between the staff and those at the head.

But this, of course, was not because of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> - only the management and organization were deficient. The Public Service Commissioner thus tries to excuse himself for the position into which he has got. The most pitiful wail of all comes later on when, in reference to the Board of Control, he endeavours to show that such a body would mean a vast increase in the staff - from seven to twenty-two. The Public Service Commissioner, however, does not give us any idea of the number of officers who are employed on staff business, advising the State  Deputy  Postmasters-General. He tries to prejudice the proposal by making it appear most costly, and as tending to multiply, to an enormous extent, the difficulties and duties of the Chief Officer. As a matter of fact, however, the  Deputy  Postmasters-General are supposed to do that work to-day, and would, under our proposal, be relieved of it. The Staff Committee would be appointed to perform the duties, and there would be a Board of Management, as a Board of Appeal. I shall endeavour to show, in a few moments, exactly what the Chief Officer is called upon to do to-day; and it is marvellous that the Public Service Commissioner should try to throw dust in the eyes of those who read this report. He says that the Chief Officer has -  to furnish the Public Service Commissioner during the month of March in each year in accord with section 2r (4) of Public Service Act 1902 a report upon the conduct, diligence, and general efficiency of each officer in 5th class of the Clerical Division. </para>
                <para class="block">Now before a Chief Officer can furnish a report he must understand what he is reporting about. Before he can estimate the diligence, efficiency, and conduct of an officer, he must know what work that officer is doing. If he is doing what he is bound to do by law, what is the meaning of this clap-trap about the impossibility of a Staff Committee doing it under the control of a Board of Management? These are some of the duties of the Chief Officer - </para>

Unfortunately, he has claimed to be the producer of the eggs, whereas he has been only the incubator ; but every egg has proved fertile. </para>

                <para class="block">That statement is made to cause it to be thought that the Commission did not do its duty, and did not give the Commissioner every chance to be heard. On the contrary, he had nearly two years in which to put his views before the Commission. The evidence was submitted to him, and he had officers to dissect it. He put before the Commission a statement covering eighteen and a half closely-printed pages, but if he did not give us what he had to give, he was unfaithful to his duty. As a matter of fact, he was not sorry to get a spell. I myself was becoming a little weary. It takes one all his time to hold the Public Service Commissioner, and to keep him in hand for eight hours is an ordeal. I shall not read other portions of the evidence of the Commissioner and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> on management, but I refer honorable members to questions 48861, 48864, 48865, 48866, 48868, 48876, 48877, and 48892. The questions to which I refer honorable members for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> evidence on the point are 47750, 47754, 47755, 47758 - that is the question in the answer to which he says, " Mac is the man" - 47759. 47768, 47769. and 48991 These are the questions, the answers to which contain the opinion of these two eminent administrators with regard to the position of manager. They want one manager of the Department. I do not know what the Government propose to do. They have done pretty well up to date in connexion with subordinate matters, but I am waiting to learn whether they will deal with the fundamental question affecting this Department in a manner which will do credit to them, and to all concerned. Unless they do so, they, and we, will have to return to this subject before many years are over. In view of the knowledge we now possess, we shall be unable to excuse ourselves by saying that we did not know what was required, and it will go hard with the party who, having the power to make the necessary reform in the management of this Department, neglected to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mclachlan</inline> himself admits that there must be a manager. It is impossible to run this Department successfully under a secretary, as we are trying to do to-day. Let honorable members imagine the kind of secretary we have. He is mainly a clerical officer, though he is now at the head of the Department. He has had little, if any, experience in telegraphy, and other sciences, the officers connected with which he has to control. He went with the Postmaster-General of the day to attend the International Postal Conference, which was held on the Continent, and when he came back, and presented himself as a witness, and was asked, " Can you tell us anything of the systems that are in operation in the older countries of Europe, or in England," this man, who was aspiring to be head of the Department, and had had the opportunity of his life to make rapid inquiries into the systems and methods in operation in the countries he visited, answered, " I do not know ; I did not inquire." </para>

                        <para>- No; he went Home with the Postmaster-General to attend the Postal Conference, but he had a good deal of time at his disposal. Junior officers df the Department who went Home at their own expense took far more interest in the Department than this aspirant for the highest position in it. They went Home in their own time, and spent their own money gaining information which we did not possess in Australia, and they submitted it to the Postal Commission when they were asked to do so, for the advancement of the country and the benefit of the service. While these men could do that, what was done elsewhere was apparently a matter of no concern to the gentleman who was aspiring to be at the head of the service. He was one of the system. It was good enough for him, and he did not care about other systems at all. It had produced him, and he did not wish to inquire into innovations and system's he knew not of, and could not understand, probably, if he had investigated them. These are the hard facts we have to face. I say to the Government, " Do the right thing, and go the whole way. Appoint a Board of Control, remodel the service, and put it under the control of men capable of conducting it. Let the staff be governed by men in close contact with them, who will understand their work, and be able to assess its value. Let the whole management of the Department depend in sections on three managers. Let the policy be dictated by the Government or Parliament, and let three competent men be responsible for the management of the service. Put the finances of the Department in order as quickly as possible, as any business men would  do  and then, in Australia, we shall have a post and telegraph service of which any one might be proud." If this were done I say, unhesitatingly, that it would relieve members of this House of a great deal of worry and trouble. If it be contended that what I propose would permit the introduction of political influence, my. answer is that, by the adoption of the recommendations of the Postal Commission, political influence would be more effectively kept out, because there would be no need for it. It is brought to bear in connexion with a department of this kind,  Only  when injustice is rife, and men are without a means of redress. With' such a board of management as I have referred to, the conduct of the Department would be such that there would be no need for men to come to this Parliament per.sonally, or collectively, for the redress of grievances. Such conditions as those which have naturally sprung from the lack of system followed in the past, could not possibly be reproduced under the system recommended by the Postal Commission in their report. I appeal to the Attorney-General especially in this matter. It is through him, very largely, that I am to-night moving the adoption of the Commission's report. Had it not been for the service I offered to render him when he was away in England I should never have been brought into contact with the centre of trouble which existed at that time, and would not Have been induced to focus my attention on this great question. I thank the honorable gentleman for giving trie the opportunity to do plenty of work for nothing, and for opening to me the door for an investigation of the service. The Sydney General Post Office is still in the honorable gentleman's electorate, _ and he has a greater individual and political concern in the matter than I have. I appeal to him, therefore, not to stop half-way. Let the Government appoint, not one manager, but a full board of control, and let us have this great Department conducted as though it were providing for the next twenty years, instead of a day. I have nothing further to say. I have done my duty. I have done my best to fight the battles of the Postal Commission . in this House against all odds. . I have done my best as a member of the Commission, and have laboured day and night. I have often been pointed at as working night after night, not excepting Sunday night, in this building in the effort to master the condition of affairs in this Department. I have been away from my home, deprived of its comforts, and my people have been deprived of my company. The work has been to me a labour of love without any hope of reward. I have been engaged in it now for four years, and, God knows, I am proud to-night to have arrived at the end of my task, and to be able to say that, for the future, the week-end is my own. <inline font-style="italic">Q</inline> have done my best for the country I have the honour to be a representative of, to advance the interest of the Government and the party to which I belong, and to help to improve the condition of affairs in a very important public Department. I have done al] I can to put the position clearly before the House. I am sorry that I have taken so long, but I was determined to do my duty. I have striven to lay before the House, in an unbiased planner, the conclusions at which I have arrived. I now leave the Government, with the information at their disposal, to act as they think fit ; but, in future, it can never be said of me that, whilst I had obtained certain information regarding the working of this great Department, I made no attempt to use it for the betterment of the service, and to forward the interests of the country and of the Parliament, and for the satisfaction of a conscience which I have always had, and trust shall continue to have, to guide me in the discharge of my public duty. </para>
