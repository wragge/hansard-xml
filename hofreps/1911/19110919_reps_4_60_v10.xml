                        <para>- I observe from the Melbourne morning newspapers that the. Prime Minister has stated it to be the intention of the Government to adopt some method of granting preference to unionists. No doubt on a matter of such importance he will desire to take the House into his confidence at the earliest moment, indicating the extent and manner in which the principlet- .  is to be applied, and how it will affect existing legislation or regulations made thereunder. </para>

                        <para>- I take no exception to the question. The recognition of the principle of preference to unionists is not a new thing in the policy of the Government, it having been part of our policy for some time past ; the declaration to which the honorable member refers is that in future the recognition will be general instead of being confined to particular instances. Capital and labour are better able to deal with each other when organized. The unions have recognised rates of wages and regulations governing conditions of employment which enable us to know what price we must pay for labour, and under what conditions it can be employed. In many trades, unionists will not work with non-unionists, and it is an advantage to have labour organized in unions so that it may be dealt with. I may add - because I think the House and the country should be taken fully into our confidence- </para>

                            <para>- As I have told those who waited on me, Ministers hope that the representatives of the unions will meet a representative of the Commonwealth in any case in which there is a dispute, and that where an agreement as to terms cannot be arrived at, the question in dispute will be submitted to the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. We shall afford every opportunity for the reference of questions to the Court, and shall abide by the awards given. </para>

I have further to say that I do not think there is any immediate danger of His Excellency being turned out. I am hoping that so long as he wishes to remain in Sydney there will be no attempt to deprive him of the present house, but that some arrangement will be arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. During the last session of the South Australian Parliament the Fisheries Act was amended, and there was inserted a section excluding Asiatics from obtaining licences in the Territory at the expiration of their present licences in the following March or April. In February last, however, I issued an Ordinance repealing that Act and reissuing it with the exclusion clauses left out. </para>

                    <para>.- I suggested on Friday last that the Government had given the Protectionists of Australia some cause to consider that they had been unfairly used, and it seems to me that they have good grounds for their complaints, since neither the new Protection nor any other system for providing high wages for those employed in our various industries could be put into force if no Protection were afforded the industries themselves. It is necessary first of all to found those industries - and to found them by Protection if that is considered the proper means - before we can determine what wages should be paid to those employed in them. </para>

                        <para>- I think it a cogent reason why the Protectionists should castigate the Government. We have reached a stage in our fiscal history when we ought to consider the desirableness of providing a means of dealing with the Tariff other than those now followed. Those who have been through a Tariff revision debate in this Parliament must admit that Parliament is not an ideal body to deal , with such a complex question. It is perhaps impossible to put a body like Parliament into a position to deal satisfactorily with all the details that must crop up in settling an important affair like the Tariff. Another method of approaching the question which seems more likely to afford a successful means of treatment is the appointment of a Tariff Board composed of persons capable of judging the scientific questions involved in the revision of duties. Such a Board could very well be brought into existence at the same time as the Tariff Commission. Perhaps the Tariff Commission itself could in one respect operate as a Tariff Board. At any rate, we seem to have reached a stage when the matter should be seriously tackled in order that the best may be done in the interests of the Commonwealth. In paragraph 14 of the Governor-General's Speech we are promised a Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in several aspects. The importance of that measure depends, of course, on the principles introduced into it, but I have heard during this debate statements which lead me to think that it is questionable whether it is worth Australia's while to proceed any further in the matter of industrial arbitration. It has been openly declared here that the workmen will never give up their right to strike. If that is so, what is the use of bringing in Arbitration Bills, the very object of " which is to prevent strikes and similar disturbances that throw industry into confusion? Those honorable members who have said that the employes will not give up their right to strike seem to be backed up by a certain amount of public opinion amongst the employes, because for some time now we have seen the Arbitration Acts flouted in various parts of Australia. Since the Labour Governments have come into power in the States things have not improved in that direction ; in fact, the strikers have been prepared to flout the law more often and more flagrantly than ever they did before. If there is to be a right to strike there ought, as a corollary, to be a right to work. One outstanding feature of the industrial life of the Commonwealth today is the extreme action that certain members of unions are prepared to take. During the strike of the agricultural implement makers' employe's in Victoria recently, many inflammatory addresses were delivered to the men, and those were the kind of addresses that were best received by the secretary and other officials of the unions involved. This seems to indicate that, even if the great body of employes are in favour of the satisfactory settlement of disputes by arbitration, and desire to obey the recognised law, their leaders are not, and if those leaders are in such a strong position that they can rush the unions, with their great bodies of workmen, into strikes against their will, things are coming to a very serious pass. It is not so much a matter of arbitration as the fact that we are fighting the extremist - the man who refuses his brother workman the right to work or even to live. In Australian unionism to-day we have got past the best features that the movement ever possessed. Thirty or forty years ago, when ex- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> and other men of his type were leading the movement, they fought for broad, manly principles, and strove to redress real grievances. They obtained eight hours as a working day, they secured the adoption of sanitary principles in all the factories, and gained better lighting, better wages, and other improvements. In the present industrial Courts we have a body which practically sits to do justice between employer and employed When the old unionists attained that, they practically attained their ideal* but the men of today do not seem to be ready or anxious to stop there. If the decision of the Court does not suit the unionist nowadays, he wants a strike. It is not now simply a question of getting a fair deal or fair wages, because such .an important issue as that of not allowing a man to work if. he will not join the union is raised. The modern-day unionist claims that he has done everything to make the path easy for the workers, but I contend that he has done very little. In fact he is doing his best to set up in Australia, not a democracy, but an aristocracy of a very limited class. He is trying to make the unionist the top dog, and that is not the best way to benefit those who are working for their daily bread, or to promote the interests of industry generally. It is not giving to men who are willing to work for the wage that the law .allows them, and who have no desire to work for less, a chance to earn their living fairly, unless they become unionists. If that is not creating a privileged class and setting up an aristocracy of the worst type, commend me to something that is. We see in the press to-day a notification of the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister in dealing with certain deputations from the Trades Hall. We learn that he has declared that the policy of the Government is to give preference to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently the Prime Minister and certain bodies from the Trades Hall have had a secret meeting, and it is now given forth to the world that the policy of the Federal Government is to accord preference to unionists. We are told in the report that this applies in a great measure to casual and temporary work. From what little experience I have had of those who seek temporary work in the Commonwealth Departments, it seems to me that a great many of them are precluded from being unionists. Numbers of them could scarcely find a union to join if they tried, and even if they did a great many are unfortunately financially at a low ebb. We are coming to something quite new if positions in the Government Departments are to be held out by the Prime Minister as bribes and baits to men to join unions. It simply means rushing them into the unions whether they wish to join or not. Amongst these casual workers there are no doubt many who have others dependent upon them, and the temporary employment they are' given in the different Departments often enables them to tide over periods of distress until they can secure more permanent situations. If only trade unionists are to be given temporary employment in the Departments, we shall have men acting as clerks and in similar positions who may be altogether unfitted for the work, whilst capable men who are not trade unionists will be left in the street. The Prime Minister has raised a vital question which I hope honorable members will not allow to drop, until an opportunity is afforded for saying a good deal more about it. I shall not enlarge upon the matter now, Hut it seems to me that the Prime Minister, by his decision, proposes the introduction of a very dangerous policy, and one upon which he can give the House very little information. What has the honorable gentleman to do with the giving of temporary employment in any of the Departments? He has no more power in the matter than has any member of the House. All these powers are supposed to be in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. He is the man who is responsible for the temporary employment of clerks and others in the Public Service. If I cared to be captious I might in this connexion charge the Government with holding out a bribe to all sorts of people to join some union in order to secure employment. We know that, however much opposed to the Labour platform a unionist may be at heart, he is usually forced to vote Labour. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Maranoa said, and he is not the only Labour member who has said the same thing, that employes would never give up their right to strike. I feel sure that when the honorable member made that remark he was thinking of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act quite as much! as any State law, and would not limit it only to those coming under a State Act. In connexion with the reference to the Northern Territory, I should like to say that I think we have made a very bad deal. South Australia has outgeneralled us all along the line. But we have the Territory now, and it is incumbent upon us to do the best we can with it. It will involve enormous expenditure to make any show there at all. I hope that the Government, notwithstanding their professed hatred of capitalists, will be prepared to consider any reasonable proposal on the part of reliable capitalists for the investment of money in the Territory. Because it seems to me that we must enlist the assistance of companies controlling great masses of capital if we are to make any impression on the development of the Northern Territory in our time. Unless our expenditure there is extremely well guarded, it will be very easy for us to fritter away £500,000 or 000,000 a year on the development of the Northern Territory without making it a place in which we should care to live, or in which we could expect immigrants to settle. I hope that in proposing expenditure in the Northern Territory, the Government will have regard to the best interests of Australia. A proposal with which I heartily concur is that to establish reciprocal trade with New Zealand. The sooner we get these reciprocal trade treaties in operation between the different parts of the Empire the better it will be. I notice that something is to be done to provide compensation to seamen. The last Government I sat behind introduced and passed an Act with this beneficent object in view, but the High Court subsequently decided that some of its provisions were unconstitutional. If the new measure to be introduced is calculated to remedy such defects, every honorable member on this side of the House will welcome it. I am sure that we shall all be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any attempt made to pass satisfactory insurance laws, or any measure which will alleviate the conditions of unemployment. Unemployment insurance is a very difficult subject with which to deal. Any measure proposed for the purpose may interfere to some extent with the good work done by friendly societies.

However, I welcome the promise of the Government to introduce this humane legislation. We are told that the Navigation Bill is to be put through all its stages this session. Judging from the history of the measure in the Senate, and in view of the fact that it has been before that branch of the Legislature for some three or four sessions, that its consideration there has not yet been completed, and, further, that it contains nearly 500 clauses, many of which raise great international questions, or questions on which, were we to make second-reading speeches upon them, we might occupy a whole session, I must say, therefore, that if the Bill is to go through this House this session, it will have to be a very long session indeed - much longer than any of us contemplated. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to unduly delay the passing of the Bill, but I do think that it should receive fair consideration at our hands. I see no reason why we should accept its provisions on trust merely because the other branch of the Legislature has discussed it exhaustively. I observe that the Government intend to spend the large surplus which accrued from the last financial year upon invalid and old-age pensions, and in building our naval unit. Personally, I do not think that we can look forward to a similar surplus in the future. On the other hand, it is certain that our expenditure is not likely to decrease. At the present moment we are on the crest of a wave of prosperity. Our Customs revenue has increased by leaps and bounds. While good seasons continue our purchasing power will be large, and as a result our imports will be large. So that practically we are at high-water mark from the stand-point of revenue. But there is no prospect of a diminution in our expenditure unless we abandon certain enterprises upon which we have already embarked. For instance, we have commenced the work of laying out the Federal Capital. In my opinion, that was a mistake, but inasmuch ais we have put our hand to the plough we cannot turn back. </para>

                        <para>- The Federal Capital is going to cost a large sum of money, and for many years it will constitute a drag upon us. Our defence vote will probably increase, until in the near future it will aggregate , £3,000,000 annually. Then the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta will cost the Commonwealth some millions sterling. Sooner or later, too, we shall have to build a line of railway connecting Oodnadatta and Pine Creek, and that will involve us in a further huge expenditure. In addition, there will be a considerable annual outlay in developing the Northern Territory. It is obvious, therefore, that if we experience a drop in our revenue of £2,000,000 - a drop which may easily occur during a bad season - we shall be faced with a deficit. As the Commonwealth has already taken a lot of money from the people through the Customs House, and as it has taxed the lands of the country to a greater extent than was warranted, it seems to me that we have almost exhausted our sources of taxation. If additional taxation should become necessary, it will have to be imposed just at a time when the people are least able to bear it, and by that means we shall crush the spirit of enterprise in the community, which we ought to foster. I do not think that I have painted too gloomy a picture of what the future may have in "store for us, notwithstanding the bountiful seasons which we have recently experienced. I shall not discuss the question of finance at greater length, because I shall have a better opportunity of dealing with it when the Budget is submitted. It seems to me that anybody who wishes to see old-age pensions paid on a generous scale must admit that, in Australia, we shall either have to adopt some system of compulsory insurance similar to that which obtains throughout the German Empire, or to levy a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution for this purpose. If it were practicable to collect the impost cheaply, I shoulld favour a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution. In a great measure that would prevent the sacrifice of self-reliance which will follow the continuance of the existing scheme. </para>

But, unfortunately, there are too many persons in the community who do not view these questions seriously enough. They are satisfied to let the future take care of itself, because they know that they will be able to obtain an old-age pension. If we wish to educate the young people of this continent on sound lines we must inculcate in them the idea that when they reach the prescribed age they will not require a pension. </para>

                        <para>- No, but if we wish the scheme to work smoothly and without sapping the self-reliance of our people, we should seriously consider whether we ought not to adopt some system of compulsory insurance, or of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution. To collect a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution would be an easy matter in the cities, but I fear that it would be a much more difficult task in the scattered rural areas. If we continue the present system we shall reduce our people to the level of those in ancient Rome who were in the habit of getting free food. At one period these persons numbered no fewer than 100,000. That was a disgraceful state of affairs, and it sapped their moral fibre. I maintain that our old-age pension scheme, as it is at present administered, will produce similarly disastrous results. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I think there are people who have come to the conclusion that the necessity of providing for their old age is not nearly so great now as it was before old-age pensions were granted. We have nearly ,£2,000,000 per annum going out on old-age and invalid pensions. That amounts to about 10s. per head for every member of the Commonwealth. It is a very big tax. I doubt whether there is anything to compare with it anywhere in the world unless in the Dominion of New Zealand. Suppose that the revenue of the Commonwealth goes down. We may some day be compelled to reduce the pensions received by these unfortunate people from 10s. a week to 7s. 6d. or 5s. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the policy of any party to reduce the amount of the pension, but necessity may some, day compel a future Government to" take such" action. In paragraph 26 of the Governor-General's Speech regret is expressed at the result of the referenda in April last. That regret is not shared by the majority of the people of this country. The more the people ponder on what was presented to them the more satisfied they will become with the action they then took in declining to overthrow the Federal system. The referenda was a victory for sound common sense. It was also a snub administered to the Government. Here is a Government that is always mouthing the word Democracy. They use it as the old lady used the word Mesopotamia. It is balm and oil to them. I do not know why they should claim to be such Democrats, because, if there was anything undemocratic in Australia it was the attempt made in April to thrust down the throats of the people various questions grouped under one heading. The people, as I have said, administered a well-deserved snub, which I hope that the Government will take to heart. If we hear any more of referenda from them, as threatened, I trust that next time they will present their propositions in a more democratic form, and give the people some chance of saying what particular projects they approve, and what they wish to reject. During the debate on the referenda proposals in this House it was urged from the other side that a certain amendment in the law should be made affecting trusts and combines. We are now told that, in consequence of the rejection of these proposals, the Government are hopeless to deal with such a body as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. But the Government introduced into their proposals more than was necessary to achieve that purpose, with the result that they were led into a ridiculous position. They wanted, not only the power to create and dissolve corporations, but also to regulate and control them, and every one. It was pointed out to them from this side - and no less an authority was quoted for our contention than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins - that if the words " regulation and control " were used an anomalous position would be created. But the Government would not take our advice to strike out those words, which they would have eliminated if they desired to act as Democrats, and to throttle the trusts instead of using them for electioneering purposes. If the question had" been properly put to the people, under a referendum on that point by itself, the Government would have secured a majority for that proposition. There is no getting away from the fact that no responsible leader on this side of the House has anything to say for the Trusts. It cannot be said that they are behind us, or that we wish to help them. The strongest anti-trust law in the world is on our statute-book to-day. Indeed, at one time during the recess the Minister of Trade and Customs himself said that under the existing law he could take action against the trusts, and that in fact he had taken steps to prevent the American Beef Trust from getting a footing in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Jones was in business before I came to this Parliament. I say again, however, that if the Government were in earnest in this matter, they could get from the people of Australia power to deal effectively with the trusts. When the Attorney-General came to Tasmania he talked practically of nothing but trusts. At about the same time an American professor was introduced there, a very eloquent gentleman, who also dealt with the cruelty of the depredations of the trusts in his own country. But, fortunately, in addition , to hearing the Attorney-General, and other emissaries of the Government, the Tasmanian people went to hear the other side also, and learnt from them what had been done in this Parliament, and how eager both sides were to crush out unfair trusts and prevent them from unfairly trading, and from making corners in the necessaries of life ; and they learned also of the other propositions covered by the referenda questions. For the first time it was proposed that the Federal Parliament should have power to regulate the wages of railway servants. The consequence was the people began to see what the policy of the Government really meant. They, therefore, decided to throw out the whole proposal, and wait until some other Government came in which would give them what they wanted. I do not propose to say any more on that head now, but I hope that in their Electoral Bill the Government will introduce the preferential system of voting; at any rate, so far as the elections for this House are concerned. If they cannot devise a system which will, in their opinion, operate properly in connexion with the elections for the Senate, it will be better to adopt preferential voting in the case of this House, and to leave the method of voting for senators as it is. </para>

                        <para>- In the case of single-seat constituencies, preferential voting is truly democratic. For a Government to refuse to adopt a scheme which will not allow a majority of the electors of a constituency to say who shall be their representative, and at the same time to set themselves up as Democrats, seems to me politically a most hypocritical thing; it is flying in the face of the majority, and saying that they will have to accept the candidates selected by only a few people in the electorates. Let us see what preferential voting means. </para>

                        <para>- That is not an argument against the principle I advocate ; in fact, it is ah argument in favour of its adoption. Under this system, the public would have the widest range of candidates to select from. They would also have this assurance - that the candidate who was declared elected had received the votes of a majority of those who had taken the trouble to go to the poll. At the present time, the pre-election system of which my honorable friends on the other side are so fond prevents very often the best men from offering their services, because it has been an unwritten law with them that the sitting member, providing that he has given anything like satisfaction during his term, shall, as a matter of course, be pre-elected. That gentleman may be a mere fossil, and may be blocking intelligent, younger, more energetic, and more patriotic men from coming forward. That should not be tolerated. </para>

                        <para>- I will do so in a moment or two. The pre-election system does not necessarily give anything like a fair reflex of the political opinions of the electors. For instance, some person may be going round a member's electorate, packing the leagues which select the candidate, and gerrymandering the position generally. By these means he may obtain more votes at the pre-election than will the sitting member of the constituency, and so displace the latter. Altogether there may be only a few hundred votes cast at a pre-election, but when you look at the roll for the constituency you will find that perhaps 30,000 persons are entitled to vote. In the first place, pre-election is a most undemocratic proceeding, and even after the process of balloting has been gone through there is no guarantee that the result in any way expresses the political opinions of the electorate concerned. The honorable member for Macquarie has desired me to explain the system of preferential voting. Let us assume that there are three candidates contesting a seat, namely, one Labour candidate and two candidates on the Liberal ticket. When an elector goes into the polling-booth he puts the figure 1 opposite the name of the candidate whom he wants to be returned, the figure 2 opposite the name of the candidate whom he prefers in the second degree, and the figure 3 opposite the name of the candidate for whom he has the least preference, and the voting paper is dropped into the ballot-box. The candidate who obtains the least number of votes on the first count is declared defeated. The number 2 votes on his papers are then distributed among the remaining two candidates./ For instance, in my constituency recently, we had a by-election. Three candidates stood under the auspices of the Liberal League. There was no Labour candidate on that occasion, although there was on a former occasion, and the result was just the same. One of the candidates was afterwards rejected by the League. </para>

                        <para>- The League rejected one candidate. On the first count this man had the lead, but on the second count one of the other two Liberal candidates was placed ahead of him and elected. My explanation is quite clear, notwithstanding the jeers of Ministers. They really do not want an explanation of preferential voting, because the more it is explained the more they realize that they are only fooling the people by adhering to the present system. We are told in the Speech of the Governor-General that the Land Tax Act is having a very satisfactory result in the way of helping, settlement. In my opinion, it has had practically no effect on Australian settlement. The price of land has not risen by reason of the operation of the Act. In fact, land has been sold at fair prices in spite of its operation, because things have been prosperous on the mainland, and persons have been prepared to give good prices. When droughts occur it will be found that persons will not be able to sell their land freely; in fact, the Land Tax Act is not aiding settlement at all. It has done nothing to increase settlement. I might be reminded that the Van Diemen's Land Company is supposed to have sold a great deal of land on the North-west coast of Tasmania to a Melbourne syndicate. But even if that be so, I should want to know what the syndicate  proposes to do before giving the opinion that settlement will be increased thereby. I do not know what property is said to have passed to the syndicate. Much of the company's best land was under lease to tenants who, I think, are proposing to buy it, or have the right to do so. </para>

                        <para>- My remarks were directed to showing that there is a system whereby the will of the majority may be expressed. Honorable members may laugh here at the idea of giving expression to the opinion of the majority, but they do not dare to do so outside. Not only has the land tax not benefited Australia by increasing settlement, but it has done us great harm where we cannot afford to lose our good name, that is, in London. The Labour party has talked a great deal of non-borrowing, and used similar shibboleths, but those of us who have had to do with business matters know what that sort of talk is worth. Sooner or later we shall need the assistance of our friends in London, and the land tax has had a damaging effect upon our reputation there, because it has shaken confidence in our methods, and' weakened our securities. As evidence to support that statement, I refer to the official report of the deputation representing great financial institutions which waited upon the Prime Minister in London. When the imposition of the tax was being discussed here, members of the Opposition pointed out what its effect was likely to be. </para>

                        <para>- It has already produced as much as that, although its author estimated the revenue from it at only £1,000,000. Sooner or later Australia will find itself in need of a larger population, and this Government should do all it can to induce the State Governments to co-operate with it in the encouragement and facilitation of immigration. The more immigrants of the right class we get, the better for the country, because each man who comes here becomes in his turn a producer. He has to be clothed and fed, and gives employment in that way and others. But there are in the community persons so mean in spirit, and so small in intellect, that they would prevent immigration in order to improve, as they think, their own chances of getting work. No Government that permits such persons to have weight with it can do its duty to the people at large. The definition of " absentees " in the land tax legislation is very cruel. I do not object to the penalization of the man who, having made money in Australia, chooses to live abroad, but it is not right to treat as absentees persons who have never lived here, and, have merely lent us money at a time when we badly needed it. </para>

                        <para>- Millions have been invested in Australia from which there has been no return. The fact that many companies which have lent money here have become large land-holders because of having to foreclose on mortgaged properties shows that the mortgagors were not prospering, and the companies themselves have not been able to pay dividends. When the money was lent, there was no desire on the part of the lenders to become landholders, and no hint of taxation which would regard as absentees such landholders as they have become. To treat them as absentees does harm, because investors in Great Britain naturally ask, " What are Australian protestations about Imperial sentiment worth?" </para>

                        <para>- No ; but we should stand by the bargain which we made with them, and not crush them with taxation which was not anticipated. Among the cases mentioned to the Prime Minister was that of the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company, which invested £3,000,000 here, and acquired a large area of land by having to foreclose on mortgages. </para>

One is surprised at bank shareholders' meetings at the number of poor people who have invested their money in bank shares in Australia and elsewhere; and some consideration should be shown to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Faithful</inline> Begg, an adviser to investors, who resided in New Zealand for many years, told the Prime Minister in London that the land tax was shaking confidence in Australian debentures, and he drew a parallel between this country and Canada which honorable members opposite ought to take to heart. Canada is encouraging the investment of capital, and inviting people to go to the Dominion. </para>

                        <para>- Every country has its poor, just as every country has its percentage of people who will not work; but Canada is booming along at a greater rate than Australia, notwithstanding our prosperity. The Prime Minister was told by the  chairman  of the Western Australian Midland Railway Company there that that company, at its inception, had been obliged to practically take up from the Government 3,300,000 acres. That railway was built on the land grant system, though the company would have much preferred, as is often done, to receive a subsidy from the Government. Western Australia, however, at that time, was not in a position to pay a subsidy ; but if a subsidy had been paid the company would not now be called upon to pay any tax. </para>

                        <para>- Only 7 per cent, of the land in Australia is alienated ; and why should the owners of that 7 per cent, pay for the defence of the remaining 93 per cent., and thus, practically, preserve the national integrity of 4,500,000 people? To each man in the country his liberty and home are just as dear, from the national point of view, as are the liberty and home of the owner of acres; and each man should be prepared to pay his fair share and no more. Those individuals who compose the land companies are paying their fair share. They live in Great Britain, where the war tax is excessive; and that war tax is as much for the defence of Australia as of any other part of the Empire. This inane legislation has the effect of making people fight shy of Australia, and alienates their sympathy instead of tightening the bonds of Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I question that statement; it is not my experience. If they are rejoicing, I do not know what at. In Tasmania there have been no land, sales due to the Federal land tax - land cannot be sold in Tasmania. I do not say that this is altogether due to the tax," because we have had a peculiar season which may, to some extent, account for the fact. The land tax has not helped settlement in Tasmania, unless it can be said that the sale of the Van Diemen's Land Company's property was due, as I believe it was, to it. I should have preferred to see the State of Tasmania buy out that company on fair terms. The shareholders, according to the press, have done very much better than I thought they would after the imposition of the Federal tax. The company went to Tasmania in the early part of the nineteenth century, and secured very large rights under its charter. It took up land, and settled some of it, spending as much as from  £40  to  £50  an acre on part of it. It settled a good deal of its agricultural land. </para>

                        <para>- The company imported the best sheep and cattle obtainable in the Old World, and, I have heard it said that it was the first to pay as much as  ,£1,000  for a stud bull in the Old Country. The best strains of cattle were brought to Tasmania, but farmers there had not the good sense to keep them, as they should have done, with the result that they were taken over to the Western District of Victoria, and became the basis of the best stock there. The company also introduced the best type of horses. For many years no dividends were paid to shareholders, and at no time have they received more than from  4  to  5  per cent, on the capital invested. Under the Federal tax, they were asked to pay  ,£10,000  per annum; and that, with the State land tax, practically swallowed up the whole of their revenue. If the Standing Orders permitted it, I should describe the using of a taxing measure, which is supposed to be for revenue-producing purposes, in such a way as to thus take away all the annual value of a person's holding as robbery- </para>

                        <para>- I disagree with the honorable member. If he were to examine the property, he would find that it includes some thousands of acres of worthless land, and that the good lands, such as those in the neighbourhood of Circular Head, have been settled by tenants. When the Land Tax Bill was before the House last session, the honorable member for Denison suggested that the company was bleeding one of its tenants there. Subsequently, I received - too late to place on record during that debars - a letter giving the true facts, and showing that the statement made by the honorable member was incorrect. The company treated the man very fairly. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. I have seen in the press a statement to the effect that the company was paying taxation) equal to  £10,000  per annum. That, perhaps, would represent the State and Federal" land tax' payments, and with such an impost upon its land the company was- forced to sell. The syndicate which purchased has at its head <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu,</inline> a gentleman who has a reputation for progressive methods, and it will be interesting to observe what he does with the property. I should be glad to see that part of Tasmania developed, as some think it will be, in consequence of this sale, but I have my doubts on the point, and do not hesitate to say that, even in Tasmania, it cannot be shown that the Federal land tax has promoted settlement. It" may in the future, and I hope that it will, but as a Parliament we did a foolish thing in passing such a tax, providing, as it does, for excessive rates and special impositions on absentees. </para>

                        <para>- There has been a revaluation since those clays, and the company have had to pay liberally on a different valuation. The tax took nearly all the revenue of the company, and any measure that does that is not a taxing measure. It is a measure practically to force a man to sell his land on terms unfair to himself, because no buyer will pay a fair capital value for it. He will first capitalize the amount of the tax. If a man wishes to sell land on which he is paying land tax to the extent of, saiy,  £1,000,  a buyer will take  £20,000  off the capital value on account of the tax, and instead of the vendor getting, say,  £100,000,  he will not get more than  £80,000.  These excessive taxation measures must have, in this young country, the same effect that they had in ancient Rome and other places. That effect has been anything but good. I have taken up a great deal more time than I intended, but that has been due to the questions addressed to me from the other side. I hope, in conclusion, that the Government will give due consideration to all the measures which they introduce, and that, although they have the matured and varied judgment of the Caucus to assist them, they will, in dealing with such technical matters as banking, seek true expert opinion outside. </para>

                    <para>. - I thank honorable members for their kind reception. I feel somewhat at a disadvantage in speaking to the Address-in-Reply, inasmuch as I have not had the opportunity of hearing what honorable members have already said in regard to it. I regret that I shall not be able to say anything very complimentary to honorable members opposite, for it is much more pleasant to say agreeable things than to criticise in a hostile manner. I do not propose to address myself to the financial question to-day. I am not able to deal with it at this stage, but I hope it will not be long before the Treasurer's Budget speech is delivered, and that we shall then have a full statement, and be able to deal with it on its merits. When I was Treasurer the present Treasurer was always complaining and criticising the delay in presenting the Budget, and I hope now he has the opportunity there will be no delay in giving the House a full account of the financial position of the Commonwealth. We have had a long recess of which I, personally, have no reason to complain, because I have been away myself faking advantage of it. The recess, however, has been a sort of hibernation on the part of the Government, because I do not suppose it ever happened before in this country that three of the principal Executive officers of a Government went away to England for six months, and took with them the chief of the staff in each of the Departments. As a rule, when Ministers go away they leave in the Departments some one who knows, not only its working, but also the Minister's views on all the questions that have arisen, and probably on many that will arise. In this case, However, the Prime Minister, the Minister of External Affairs, and the Minister of Defence, not only went themselves - I hope they enjoyed themselves - but also took with them their chief Executive officers. That was not a good arrangement for the State, and those who were left in charge of the Departments must have been, to some extent, inconvenienced in consequence. </para>

                <para>The first matter touched upon in the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General is the Coronation of the King, at which I had the honour of being present, as also had a large number of members of this House, who went there in a representative capacity. I went as a private citizen. I think the Coronation of the present King will be memorable in the annals of the Caucus party opposite, because fourteen of their chosen members went there specially invited, as we are told in the Speech, to be -present on that great occasion. They took with them a large retinue of secretaries and officers, and were there as the honoured guests of the nation. No expense was spared to make a good display, so far as they were personally concerned, but I regret that no expense was incurred to make a display on behalf of Australia. I could not help regretting, when I drove down Whitehall on the morning of the Coronation, and I am sure that other honorable members will share my regret, that there was no evidence whatever of the existence of the Commonwealth of Australia. We saw something of Canada in the shape of triumphal arches, under which the King and Queen and their retinue went. We saw a good deal about New Zealand, in the shape of a magnificent arch erected by her, but we saw nothing of Australia, and it was the same the next day or the day after, when the procession went through London. All through, there was nothing to indicate to the immense concourse of people that there was an Australia in existence. That was to be regretted on such an occasion, when fourteen chosen members from the other side of the House, and some from this were present. Some display might have been made in the centre of the Empire on such a great occasion. I regret that nothing was done, and I am sure that every member of the House who was there regretted it also. The very troops that escorted the Prime Minister were borrowed from Canada and South Africa. Was that a fitting display for this Commonwealth ? In my opinion, and in the opinion of every one from Australia that I met there, it was not. </para>

It would be out of place, and much against my wish, to say a word about such expenses, but I will say that there has never been sent to the Old Country a representation that cost so much as did this one. In fact, I think it cost double the cost of any other representation that has gone from this country. </para>

                        <para>- That, I suppose, included the sending of troops. I am speaking of the personal part of the matter. It was a glorious event, and a great occasion; .but it is sad to have to relate that the advent to, and departure from, London of the fourteen representatives of the Caucus party opposite, who visited the Old Country to attend the Coronation, though it ought to have excited the wonder and the curiosity of the people of England, was allowed to pass without any particular notice. I was in London at the time, and neither the event itself, nor the deliberations of the Conference, seemed to occupy the public mind. No one took any interest in what was being done at the Conference. So far as I could find out, no one knew or cared what was being done there. Why was this? Because it was well understood that nothing would be done there. Every one who attended the Conference was shackled. The Prime 'Minister of Canada was shackled. Our own Prime Minister was so shackled that he could not commit himself to anything, because he was told by the Caucus that he must not do so. The members of the Imperial Government who attended the Conference were also shackled by their Free Trade policy. As a consequence, every one knew from the beginning that nothing whatever would be done. </para>

                    <para>A notable feature and marked advance upon previous Conferences was the action of the British Government in taking the Oversea Dominions' representatives into their full and unreserved confidence regarding their foreign policy. </para>

                <para class="block">I am at a loss to understand how the Executive representatives from this Parliament - "the Dauntless Three" - could discover how far former representatives of the oversea Dominions were taken into the confidence of the Imperial Government. I do not think that even .the members of the Imperial Government who were present at the Conference could possibly know how far their predecessors had taken the members of previous Conferences into their confidence. I do not know how any one, unless it were some official secretary, could know exactly what was said by previous Prime Ministers of Great Britain in the confidential addresses they made to those present at former Conferences. I attended an Imperial Conference on two or three occasions, and I never knew, or understood, that there was any withholding of full confidence by the representatives of the Imperial Government from the representatives of the oversea Dominions. In fact, it seemed to me that we were addressed in the most open and frank way whilst we were asked to be very careful not to disclose the confidential information imparted. I do not think the reference I have quoted reads very well. It seems to me to be like an attempt to cover up the fact that nothing was done, or could be done, at the recent Imperial Conference, by saying that those who attended it were taken into the confidence of the British Government to a greater extent than had heretofore been the practice. I very much question if they were. I wish to know where these confidences are now. Do they, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, remain with the three Ministers who represented Australia? Have they been conveyed to the Caucus? Of what use are they if they are held only by the three Ministers referred to? </para>

                        <para>- My opinion is that they have nothing to disclose. Who holds these secrets? Honorable members who have held Ministerial office are aware that there are very few secrets in a Government, and I do not suppose that the present Imperial Government is exceptional in this respect. Are these secrets intended for the use of the Caucus ? If they are to be known only to the Prime Minister, the Minister of External Affairs, and the Minister of Defence, they cannot be very important. The one proposal submitted to the Conference which seemed to me to be of real importance, that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward, dealing with the relations of the overseas Dominions with the Empire in time of war, received scant courtesy from the representatives of Australia. What our relations with the Empire are to be when the Empire is at war and the enemy is at our gates is a burning question to-day, and the most important question we have to settle in the future, and there should be no ambiguity or uncertainty about it. That is the question which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward wished to be dealt with at the Conference; and it was practically set aside, the representatives of Australia voting against the motion submitted. </para>

                <para>A reference is made in the Speech to the Naval Agreement. I am glad that the agreement was made. I have not had an opportunity of reading it lately, but I perused it at the time, and thought it excellent. However, it was our agreement, and not that of the present Government. I believe it is couched in almost the identical words of the agreement made by the Government of which I was a member, and of which the honorable member for Ballarat was Prime Minister. It was taken from us, as usual, without any acknowledgment whatever. That seems to be in accordance with the practice of honorable members opposite. They do not mind taking away one's ideas, pirating or plagiarizing what others have proposed, but they are not generous enough to give the authors of such proposals the credit of their origin, or to say that the proposals made were in accordance with the views promulgated by others. </para>
                <para>I have only had an opportunity of looking through the Speech since my arrival the day before yesterday, but I have noticed that almost every matter with which it deals was originated by the previous Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but, while the substance of the Speech is good and belongs to us, the administration has been downright bad. The only matters in the Speech which we have no wish to take any credit for, and which, on the contrary, we reprobate, are the land tax and some legislation intended to give an unfair preference to unionists. Leaving these matters out, all the rest may be said to be the work of the previous Government. I will name some of the matters to which I refer. First of all, there is the Naval Agreement. I understand that the honorable member for Darling Downs the other day showed that it is almost in the very words of the agreement made by the previous Government. </para>

                <para>Again, there is penny postage. I have not had time to look up what honorable members said about penny postage a few years ago, but I know that, five years ago, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro introduced a measure to give effect to it with the full consent of myself and the then Treasurer. Who was it who at that time jeered at and defeated the proposal? It was honorable members opposite, who are now taking credit for it as though it were some new proposal which they introduced. </para>
                <para>If they had not opposed the measure five years ago, we should have had penny postage established at that time, and it would now be reproductive. When we introduced the measure, we were jeered at. I do not know what was not said about the proposal, but generally we were told that it would result in a great loss to the country. However, as soon as honorable members opposite got into power, they at once brought forward a measure for the establishment of penny postage, and seek now to take all the credit for it. </para>

I know perfectly well that the reform will pay, and that very soon. The experience of Canada, New Zealand, and the Old Country is convincing proof of that. Only the other day, I had an opportunity of looking at the returns, and although I did not scrutinize them very closely, it seemed to me that those croakers who declared that we would lose a considerable sum during the first year of the operation of penny postage will be disappointed. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable member knows a great deal. But seeing that the Act has only been in force a few months, I fail to see how he can know that. Then there is the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. I shall have something to say about that presently. The transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, the repression of trusts and combines, the Federal Capital, and the notes issue - all these proposals formed part of the policy of the previous Government. The Prime Minister knows very well that when he assumed office, he found in the Treasury a Banking Bill and a Commonwealth Notes Bill, together with all the correspondence relating to them which had passed between myself and the Bank of England, and other financial authorities. I have been grossly misrepresented by certain newspapers, and by some honorable members, concerning the action which I took in regard j to those Bills and correspondence when I was leaving office. </para>

                        <para>-  I think it was the honorable member for Hume who mentioned on one occasion that when I was quitting office, I instructed either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> to burn certain papers but that he took good care they were not burnt. That most incorrect and unfounded statement has been made several times, and I have seen it again in the press during the last few days. As a matter of fact, every single paper - private and public - and every draft of every Bill connected with finance, I left in the Treasury for the benefit of my successor. I did that on two occasions, namely, in 1907 and in 1910. It is discreditable for any person to charge me with petty meannesses of that description. I have never been guilty of anything of the sort. I consider it my duty to render to my successor in office all the assistance I can. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to know more about this matter. If the Government are composed of energetic and enterprising men, let them push on with the work immediately. They have the necessary money. As a matter of fact, they are lending money to the States. Surely, then, they are in a position to undertake necessary works for the Federal Government. This stick-in-the-mud and do-nothing policy will ruin the country yet. If the Government do not exhibit more energy we shall not get to Canberra for many years. I understand that the Department of Home Affairs intends to construct a railway to Yass and Queanbeyan, and thus to compel the people of Victoria to journey from Albury to Cootamundra and Yass, and thence to the Seat of Government. Such a proposal is calculated to arouse nothing but disgust. Why cannot we have a railway built from Albury <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Tumut, to the Federal Capital? It is said that the country is rough in some parts, but what of that? I say that a railway from Albury, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Tumut, to the Federal Capital, would be nearly 100 miles shorter than the line suggested by the Minister of Home Affairs. Is it not due to the people of Victoria that they should have railway communication with the Federal Capital as direct as possible ? The proposal of the Minister merely serves to show that he does not understand the geography of this country. If he would only visit other lands and see how railways are taken through mountains and ravines, he would not hesitate to put a line through the country I have indicated. It might be necessary to construct a few tunnels, but what of that ? Only the other day I passed through a tunnel which is 12½ miles long. If the Victorian representatives in this Parliament are content to journey to the Federal Capital by the circuitous route <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Cootamundra and Yass, they lack the enterprise with which "they should be imbued. </para>

I have to find fault with my honorable friend the Minister of Home Affairs. He has too much to say, and is not doing enough; whilst the things that he is doing are simply little ones, it is the great things that succeed. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> once wrote to me, ' 1 After all, it is the great things that succeed ; it is no use shrinking and peddling nowadays ; those who wish to succeed must risk something, and courage finds its own reward." Let my honorable friend take that home with him and think about it. He should not be content with talking about putting up a brickyard here, and establishing an avenue of trees there. Let him set about preparing plans for building a railway straight from Albury into the Federal Capital. </para>

                    <para>The effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries is being carefully watched by My Advisers, with a view to revision wherever the information obtained by them shows this to be necessary. "Obtained by them" - they have not the information yet ! They are going to look about to find something. Yet they have been eighteen months in office. Where are those " strangled industries " which we read about before the present Ministry came into office? When we were in office we were continually reading references to " strangled industries " in the chief Protectionist newspaper, and were constantly urged that something must be done at once. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the explanation. Where is that great prohibitionist, the Minister of Trade and Customs ? Evidently he is not so eager on this subject when he is enjoying the sweets of Cabinet rank as he was when in the shades of Opposition. But he is going to " watch carefully," with a view to revision, whenever the information obtained shows this to be necessary. So that no information has yet been obtained on the subject. The Government have been eighteen months in office and know nothing. If the members of the Ministry have all been " watching very carefully " and have found nothing, one would assume that there has been nothing to find. Otherwise they would surely have done something. But when this information is obtained the Minister of Trade and Customs is going to do it. My view is that he will not do anything until the next general election is close upon us. I expect that then he will go on the stump promising to protect everybody, and that every one is to grow rich thereby. I myself am a Protectionist, though I am not such an one as he is. I do believe, however, that I am more genuine than he is, because if I were Minister I certainly would do something to keep my promises and to be consistent, whereas he is only " watching." </para>

                <para>I wish to refer to the proposed amendment of the electoral law. Unless my honorable friends in the Ministry are very careful - and I speak with no self-interest in this matter - they will find that there will be no time to re-adjust the boundaries of electorates before the general election. I can afford to be disinterested, because my own constituency is very large - containing something like 40,000 electors - and the larger the constituency the better chance I have of being elected. Unless Ministers are very careful the old divisions will be in existence when the next elections take place. What will happen? Some time - perhaps towards the end of this session - Commissioners may be appointed. They will not bring up their report during the present session, unless they set about it very early. Next session their report will be considered, but if it does not suit honorable members opposite, it will be referred back, or be kicked out altogether. </para>

                        <para>- It was not in my own interest that that had to be done, because my electorate suited me very well as it was. Suppose that the report of the Commissioners is sent back to them. In that event the elections will take place under the old arrangements, because there will not be time for an amended report to bie received. I have no personal complaint to make, because my electorate, as it is now denned, suits me. Though its extent is large, I have a better chance with a constituency of that size than with a smaller one. Nevertheless the subject requires to be looked into, and I throw out the suggestion in the public interest, not in my own. I also wish to say a word on the present Electoral Act, and, in doing so, I intend to be pretty outspoken. The Act is unworkable. It contains restrictions and penalties which nobody does, nor can, observe. I doubt whether there is a single honorable member in this House whose agents do not break the Act. It must be so. Any political organization that carries on its operations in a constituency is an agent for one or other of the candidates. The Labour organizations, in the constituencies of the honorable gentlemen opposite, are their agents. The Liberal leagues, in my electorate, are my agents. Nevertheless, they do numbers of things that I know nothing about. Such has also been the case in England. Several cases came before the Courts while I was there, and in each instance the sitting member lost his seat, because agency was legally proved on the part of political organizations which worked for his return. Much the same would have happened to nearly every one of us if our seats had been challenged. I do not care what an honorable member does - if an organization acts for him it is his agent. If it spends money in his interests, it does so as his agent. At any time an honorable member may have to bear the penalty for what is done by such an organization. There has never been a case arising under our Electoral Act, because every one knows that all those who are elected are in the same boat. If honorable members opposite were to bring a case against us we should bring cases against them, and the whole Parliament would be upside down. Let us bring a little common sense to bear on this matter. Let us see whether we cannot try to punish those who flagrantly evade the provisions of the Act, or violate them. But do not make the law so tight that an organization cannot put on a tree a placard asking the electors to vote for any one without getting into trouble. At present, an organization cannot lawfully issue the placards which are posted all over the country. Let us introduce common sense into our law, in the interests of all of us. I ask honorable members to see if they cannot put the electoral law on a practical basis, making it fair to everybody, so that its provisions can be carried out, and not be a dead letter. </para>

When I was on my way from England, and also after I had arrived in Western Australia, I read a great deal in the press about the sugar industry - the difficulties which arose in connexion with labour, and the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister.

                        <para>-  I want to know whether this statement which I saw several times was a Ministerial statement, and whether the Prime Minister himself has adopted it as part of his policy? I do not wish him to say anything against his colleague who was acting for him during his absence from the Commonwealth. Still, it seems to me that it is due to us, and to the people of this country, seeing that the statement was deliberately made, that we should know what is the policy of the Government in regard to the sugar industry. Perhaps I have not read what the Prime Minister has stated during the last few days. If he has said anything on the subject, probably I shall hear of it. Tt is most extraordinary that the acting leader of a party should express opinions as to policy unless he is certain that his chief shares them. T believe that there are public men who have done that sort of thing, but I hold that a Minister who is left in charge of a Government or a Department by a colleague has no right to advocate measures contrary to his views. It is discreditable and disloyal conduct. I hope that it will be denounced by every right-thinking man as very unfair, ungenerous, and improper. I do not believe for a moment that the Prime Minister is in favour of the abolition of the Customs duty, because I remember how valiantly he has stood up here, throughout many years, in his efforts to preserve and protect in his own peculiar way the sugar industry. To take away the protective duty would be, in my opinion, to sacrifice the industry, because the Government could scarcely allow the bounty and the Excise duty to stand. They must be repealed, tpo, and then sugar from all parts of the world where labour is cheap would be dumped into Australia. What would be the result? The land which is now employed in growing sugar-cane would have to be devoted to the growth of other products. We have a right to know whether the Attorney-General voiced the opinion of his colleague when he made this statement, not once, but several times, to deputations, and through the press. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in that sort of thing, nor does the honorable member, I think. I hold that if a man is leading a party, he has to consider the interests of that party, and to be loyal to it and to the country. The conduct of the Attorney-General was not right from the point of view of my honorable friends opposite, or from my point of view. I believe that the imposition of restrictions of one sort and another - giving a bounty and charging an Excise - holding the arbitrary power of the Minister <inline font-style="italic">in terrorem</inline> over the heads of the sugar-growers - will eventually ruin the sugar industry. I have often advocated here that it should be treated exactly as any other industry. Any product of the soil, whether it is sugar, maize, or corn, or oats, should be protected against unfair competition from outside, and placed under no restrictions inside. That is the policy which we adopted in the case of every industry ; we gave each an opportunity to develop. Is the sugar industry a sacred one? Is it holy land in North Queensland? I have been told that the sugar industry has been specially treated because my honorable friends opposite do not want coloured people to work up there. If a coloured man has a right to remain in Australia and work here, I would sooner see him working up in North Queensland than in the streets of Melbourne. If my opinion were asked, I would say, " Let him work up there, because, if contamination is possible, he is much more likely to contaminate the youth by living in crowded centres than he is in the tropics, to which people do not go altogether from choice." There is only one real reason for this special treatment. I think that the object of the Caucus Party is to keep control of every producer in that country, so that my honorable friends can always have their hands upon him, giving him something or taking it away, whenever they like. That is a wrong system to follow, and I hope that the Government will get rid of it. The reason why the previous Government did not take that step was because we were under an agreement for a certain time. After that time has expired, why should we continue this foolish retrograde system of interfering with persons who are producing from the land? It is a very bad thing for any producer to feel that the results of his toil and industry are in jeopardy, and that Ministers may intervene at any time and put restrictions upon him. This ought to be a free country, with free men, and if men are engaged in an industry, they ought to be given peace and security. The sugar industry should be no exception to the rule. Why should not a man grow sugar as well as wheat without being subject to restrictions? There ought to be less restrictions in the far-away north', where the climate is so hot, than in Victoria. The whole system is rotten to the core. What sense is there in paying a bounty of  £3  a ton to the sugar-grower and charging him an Excise duty of <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> a ton? Why not take <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> a ton from him? </para>

In the United States, would private investors hesitate ten minutes about supporting a proposal for the construction of a line to connect the two sides of a continent, especially when that line would pass across a mining field which has produced £100,000,000 worth of gold, and through at least 20,000,000 acres of grass land, joining Eastern Australia with a population of  4,500,000,  with the western side, with a growing population of 300,000 people, and giving access to the port that is the nearest to Europe ? Yet we have been ten years thinking about this matter. While the delay has cost me many a sad moment, I congratulate honorable members upon having the promise of the Government that the work is at last to be carried out. Those who fear that the enterprise will be a failure have no faith in their own country. The railway will connect Eastern and Western Australia, and make Federation a reality. I hope that the Government will use expedition in this matter. </para>

                <para>In paragraph 17 of the Speech, we are told that on the 1st January last -  the Northern Territory was acquired and taken over as a Territory of the Commonwealth. YOU will be invited to consider measures to provide for the government and development of the Territory. </para>
                <para class="block">Parliament has already passed legislation which gives Ministers <inline font-style="italic">earle blanche</inline> in the making of ordinances for its government and development. But what have they done? I have heard practically nothing about the Territory except for some fuss made by the Protector of Natives. It is necessary to have enterprise, public spirit, and ability in those appointed for the work of development. We must make railways to open up the country. If I were Prime Minister, I would say to the Government of South Australia: "Continue your railway to the border, and the Commonwealth will extend it to Pine Creek." No doubt that offer would be accepted. What are Ministers doing with the Oodnadatta line? We have been told that the grass is growing on it. Is its management being left to the Government of South Australia? That, under present circumstances, is a reasonable course to take. The reference to the Territory in the Speech is a milk-and-water one ; the Government should have proposed the construction of a railway. The Territory should certainly be connected with South Australia - perhaps by the extension of the Oodnadatta line to Pine Creek - and with Queensland. The making of such connexions would bring the whole of Australia into communication. There is a great deal of poor country in the Northern Territory, but there is also a great deal of good country there - on the Victoria River, along the Queensland border, and on the Roper River. It needs opening up by the construction of railways, so that people may settle there. I have never thought much of the tropics as a field of labour for white men. It is a good thing to keep Australia white, but, although in the past our attitude to the Northern Territory has been that of the little boy in the advertisement for Pears' soap - " He won't be happy till be gets it " - I have always wondered what we should do with it when we got it. At least .£20,000,000 must be spent there to make it a country in which white people will settle. I believe in our own race, and prefer our own people to any other. The Minister will do a good work, and his name will go down to posterity, if he succeeds in settling the Territory with white people. Personally, I should be willing to give a big grant of land to any member of the Caucus party who would settle there, on the condition that he should not return. The honorable member for Maranoa has told us that he has sold the principality which he used to own, and I, for one, should be willing to give him 100,000 acres in the Northern Territory on condition that he went there and never came back, although, on second thoughts, I should not like to see him cut of the House. </para>

Why is it not stated in the Speech that penny postage was proposed by the predecessors of this Government, when the honorable member for Eden-Monaro was Postmaster-General, but rejected then by the Labour party and others, although proposed again and carried last year, because of a change of opinion? In this, as in other matters, the Labour party has acted very much as a cuckoo does in taking possession of other birds' nests. It has taken our proposals without saying "Thank you." </para>

                        <para>- I do not represent a part of the country that I do not know. At any rate, only some . £30,000 is paid in Federal land tax, owing to the very few large estates in the western State. Both the statement that the land tax is having a "satisfactory effect" on land settlement, and the statement that it is " attracting a desirable class of immigrants," are inaccurate. I am aware that the High Commissioner made the ill-advised statement in London that the tax would give more land for the worker. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that that is so. Why is it? It is because the High Commissioner has not a brass farthing to pay for sending people here. He is given money to advertise and talk about Australia ; but when any application is made at his office, the intending immigrant has to be sent down to the Agent-General of the State for which he expresses a preference. The High Commissioner is not placed in a position to do anything but talk and advertise; and my complaint against the Government is that it is a talking, do-nothing Government. </para>

                        <para>- But my point is that these people are not conning because of the land tax. Do honorable members mean to say that the immigrants to New South Wales and Western Australia are coming to take up land that has been subdivided ? No ; they are coming to take up new lands thrown open by the Government. The real effect of the land tax has been one of which honorable members never thought when they passed the measure. The effect has been to make  12,000  people of Australia pay  £1,500,000  a year. It is a class tax imposed on people who have acquired land instead of some other form of property, and have, in many cases, been the pioneers in the development of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No, that is it. There seems to be a vendetta - a crusade against the landed classes of this country. Honorable members opposite, by their cheers, if not by words, say that the man who has invested his earnings in land is an undesirable person - a person whom they,8 in fact, would appear to hate and envy, and whose possessions they would seem to covet. Then what about the man who, with  £20,000  worth of land, has  £15,000  mortgage on it? He is taxed all the same; and that is not honest. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the remark, and shall say that the tax is specially intended to drive the man who has land from that which he has honestly acquired. Is it not natural that, under the circumstances, men will not take up land. I had occasion to dispose of some trust land the other day; and, though it was worth  £15,000,  I had to take  £10,000,  and this was on account of this tax. </para>

                <para>Paragraph 34 expresses regret that no settlement of the question of the consolidation of State debts has been arrived at, but states that the matter " continues to engage the most serious consideration of the Government." The "most serious consideration " ! That is like the phrase about the Tariff being "carefully watched." How long will the Government take over the "serious consideration" of this question? The Prime Minister some time ago said that there could be no arrangement with the States financially until the debts were taken over; and, although the necessary power was given to deal with the two matters together, eighteen months ago, nothing has' been done. I ask the Prime Minister what financiers he saw on this question when he was in London? I do not believe that he saw one of any eminence, or went seriously into the matter. Three of the most prominent Ministers, with the Under- Treasurer, and other Under-Secretaries, were in London; and yet the Prime Minister never consulted any of the financiers there. I took some trouble to inquire, but I could not find that he had approached the financial authorities in any way. We had an expensive delegation at Home, with this important matter hanging over our heads - debts maturing to. the amount of millions in a few years - and yet the Prime Minister never took advantage of this, the greatest opportunity that could present itself. The Prime Minister, however, has a majority behind him, and he will not even listen to argument. I repeat that the right honorable gentleman did not consult any of the financiers in London, nor take any active steps there with regard to the consolidation of the State debts. </para>

                <para class="block">Is it the exactions of the " trusts " alone that make an extension of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth imperative? If so, why did the Government propose to deal with the whole gamut of trusts, monopolies and combines? No one would defend a trust that was injurious in its effects upon the public. I would freely assist to repress trusts of such a character, but, as I have heard the Labour party say, there are both good and bad trusts. The Labour party are parties, for instance, to the Coal Vend, which they have described as a beneficent trust, because it consists of a league or conspiracy on the part of employers and employes to secure good prices at the expense of the public. It is interesting! to notice that the Government deal very gently with the referenda vote, recognising that they are criticising their masters, the electors of Australia. And so they say that they " regret " the action of their masters ! I should think they would. To say that they ' " regret " it is to put their actual feelings very mildly. The result was a terrible shock to them. When the numbers went up at first they said, " We shall put the whole matter again to the people; we shall have it over again."They do not say that now, and I do not hesitate to tell them that if they put before the people the same issues as they did last April the people would reject them again. The people having spoken, the Government have a right to obey, and the verdict of the people, I contend, has discredited the present Ministry. It is no longer the powerful Government, with a strong party behind if, that it claimed to be last year, although it is well to remember, even in connexion with the referenda, that at the general election of  1910 <inline font-style="italic">[they</inline> secured, a majority of only  25,000.  Can we not all recall how they boasted about that majority of 25,000 against the financial agreement? We were told then that they had a mandate from the people. 1,500,000 voters went to the poll, 900,000 did not vote, and the present Government secured a majority of 25,000, which they said gave them a mandate from the people. They were going, they said, to act upon that mandate. They formulated their policy, called upon the electors to deal with four or five different sets of proposals in one question, and, when we protested, saying that the question should be divided so that the people might vote for what they favoured and vote against the proposals of which they disapproved, they declared loudly, " No, let us have the whole or none." The result of the referenda was not a majority of 25,000 in their favour, but a majority of 250,000 against them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman knows that the result of the last referenda was the biggest blow that has ever been struck at the Caucus party. It was not only the unpalatableness of the proposals submitted at the referenda, but the Ministry's record of a year of incompetence, that brought it about. The electors, having given the Labour party an opportunity to show what they could do, saw that when in office they were determined to be the masters of the people, and to ride rough-shod over them. Having been placed in power, the Labour party said, "Let us sweep the Constitution away, and we will show you what we will do. The people, however, stood by the Constitution, and no one can deny that my honorable friends opposite are a very different party from what they were last year. They " regret " the decision of the people at the referenda in April last ! They tell their masters - the people - that they " regret'' what they did ! I should like to know whose was the arrogant stupidity that suggested such a phrase as "We regret" in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>.- After the very exhaustive criticism by the right honorable member for Swan, who has dealt with the items in the Governor-General's Speech seriatim, there appears to be very little fresh ground to be broken. I must congratulate the Government upon padding the Speech to such an extent that they make a very formidable show of attempting to do something after the long recess. However, the programme appears to me to be just the same as an up-to-date <inline font-style="italic">menu</inline> in any of our cook-shops, and I propose to take out of it such matter as suits my own taste. I am pleased to note that the question of the Postal  Department,  of which we have previously heard so much in this House, has been severely left alone during this debate. Evidently, matters are going on a little more smoothly than they did in the past. The eighth paragraph in 'the Speech refers to the success of the compulsory training movement initiated some time ago. I am pleased that that has been successful, but there are one or two matters that call for attention, and possibly the Government are able to deal with them without introducing fresh legislation. The other night I saw a number of lads being compulsorily trained, and outside the drill area were a number of hoodlums who were above the compulsory age, and therefore free. They were a perfect nuisance to the area officer. When he gave one order they would give another, which made things very perplexing to the lads who were being drilled. I hope the Minister will see that the lads now being put through their drill are protected from such conduct. The other day, when opening the harness factory, the Minister referred to the difficulty which the Department have had with contractors. He, no doubt, gave that as one reason why the Government harness factory had been established. I see no reason why the' Government should not establish factories to provide their own requirements, but the whole of the blame with regard to difficulties with contractors cannot always be laid at the contractors' door. The Government are themselves to blame to a very great extent in many cases. Only recently I was speaking to a contractor who had had very large contracts for making clothing for the Defence Forces. He told me that he was compelled by the rules of the Defence Department to pay cash for the material which he had to make up into uniforms, and that when he made it up and sent in his account for it, he was sometimes compelled to wait as long as six months for the money. If there is one thing that the Government, as a Labour Government, should aim at doing, it is to give the small contractor an opportunity of competing for Government work. But it is an utter impossibility for any small contractor to pay the Department cash down for cloth, and wait six months before getting any return. I believe there is likely to be a great leakage from the Defence Forces through the want of a proper pensions scheme. A number of very efficient officers are now being retired on account of having reached the specified age. Although they are quite capable of doing good work, they are being sent out into the world to start life afresh. Unless we provide something in the shape of a pension we shall not get the best brains of the Commonwealth into the Defence Forces, and if there is any Department in the service where the best brains are wanted it is surely the Defence Department, on which our safety, and even our existence, depend. I would urge the Government to give the matter very serious consideration. They are no doubt in sympathy with a pensions scheme, but the difficulty in the past appears to have been to get a workable scheme that would apply, not only to defence, but to other Departments also. I think it is a poor thing for any one to have to look forward to an old-age pension, or the indigent allowance meted out now to persons without means. When men have spent the best part of their lives in the defence of their country, they should be able to look forward to an allowance when they reach the age at which they have to be passed out. There has been a good deal of discussion on the sugar question, and I am pleased to know that the Government have decided to appoint a Commission to inquire into the working of the industry. We asked for this to be done some time ago. The honorable member for Capricornia had a notice of motion on the paper, and this was fully discussed last session, but the Government decided that a Commission was unnecessary. In fact, the previous Government had appointed a Commission, but the present Government abandoned it. All that we in Queensland are asking for, and have asked for right through the piece, is a thorough inquiry into the sugar industry, and then we ask that legislation may be introduced, not upon the finding of the Commission, but upon the evidence that the Commission will adduce. It startles one to notice the want of knowledge of honorable members on this great question. I say this with all respect to honorable members, because they cannot be living encyclopaedias, but one does not need to be an expert on this matter - and I do not claim to be one - to realize that the great majority of members of this House have a very poor grasp of the sugar question. We had in the sugar districts lately a strike, which was brought about, not by the sugar workers themselves, but by a few discontents from Chillagoe, who had no interest in the industry whatever. </para>

                        <para>- It is immaterial where the strike started. There has been some discussion on the extra cost of sugar to the public since the strike. It may be merely a coincidence that the rise in the price of sugar throughout the world took place immediately after the strike, but it has afforded some honorable members an excellent opportunity to blame the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for taking advantage of their alleged monopoly to increase the price of sugar as they have done. 1 do not hold a brief for the Colonial </para>

We have heard nothing in this House about that. There was a partial strike of the waterside workers. They united with the Shipping Combine to fleece the public of Australia by putting up freights to the extent of 12½ per cent. In order to pay off free workers who would be referred to by my honorable friends opposite as scabs, they paid the passage of these men back to Sydney, and put up <inline font-style="italic">£200,</inline> half of which was subscribed by the waterside workers for the purpose ; whilst the public have been fleeced to the extent of 2s. 6d. per ton on freights from the nth of the present month.

                        <para>- The moisture in butter referred to by the honorable member was only 1 per cent., whilst the increase in the rate of freights amounts to 12½ per cent. The sugar industry is a national industry, the success of which we cannot afford to jeopardize. We hear a great deal of talk about a White Australia and Australian defence. But I would ask, How is Australia to be defended if it is not peopled? I remind honorable members that the sugar industry is admirably suited to the conditions of our northern districts, and affords the best means of closely settling that part of the Commonwealth. If we are to defend this country, the sugar industry should be looked at from a national and political point of view, and we should not be influenced merely by the selfish consideration as to what we have to pay for sugar. After all, I do not think that any one can complain of the price of sugar even at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. I am prepared to allow a fair amount of Protection to every Australian industry that can support itself and give a fair return to the people for the Protection afforded. I think, therefore, that the honorable member's reference to cheap salt was uncalled for. I listened to the greater portion of the honorable member's speech, in which he referred to the terrible state of affairs prevailing in Fiji. I regret that such a state of affairs should be found in any part of the British Dominions, and I hope those responsible for its existence will do something to put an end to it. It is that sort of thing we shall have to contend with in our sugar industry in Australia, if effect be given to the Attorney-General's proposal to wipe out the Protection afforded the industry at the present time, because we should have to compete with sugar produced in Fiji under the conditions referred to by the honorable member for Grey. We have at present to compete with Fiji in the banana trade, and our bananas are very lightly protected indeed. I wish to show that the cost of the production of sugar amounts to so much that it cannot be contended that the average price of sugar in Australia is too high. The average price paid for raw sugar during the last ten years in Queensland was <inline font-style="italic">£11</inline> 3s. 5d. per ton. That is to say, practically since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. I give these figures to show the cost of producing a ton of refined sugar - </para>

                        <para>- The figures which I quoted prior to the suspension of the sitting show that it costs the Colonial Sugar Refining Company  ^£20 7s. 8d.  to produce a ton of sugar. That company may possibly employ some cheaper method of refining sugar than is in vogue in America, but I do not suppose that the difference would amount to .very much. Save in the one item of refining, the figures which I have given represent the American cost of' production, and their accuracy is indisputable. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has increased the price of sugar in sympathy with the outside markets of the world, and in doing so it has only acted as it must act as the custodian of the rights of the producers. If the company were scooping in the additional price itself, there might be something in the outcry against monopoly. </para>

                        <para>- One can scarcely complain of the company's action, seeing that the benefit of the enhanced price is passed on to the mills. " Some of those mills are run upon co-operative lines, and therefore reap the full benefit of their own enterprise. I hope that the day is not far distant when the whole of the mills, and the refinery as well, will be conducted on a cooperative basis. If any profit is to be made out of the industry, it should be made by those people who toil hard to produce the sugar. But I do not know that such a state of things would benefit the public. The consumer seems to be the last person in the world to receive consideration, and it is only natural that the producers of sugar should exact the full benefit accruing from an increased price. </para>

                        <para>- It applies to everything. Even the honorable member gets as much as he can, every time. I endeavour to act straightforwardly, but I confess that I am out to make money on every possible occasion. It is just as well to be candid in this matter. We are all after the " filthy lucre." During this debate we have heard something of loyalty, and I shall always look back with pride to my parents who brought me up to respect and to love the British Empire. That has become part of my nature. I hope that I shall never be accused of being a lip-loyalist. But apart from any sentimental considerations, there is a selfishness connected with this question of loyalty to the Empire which should appeal to us. Some time ago,  Lt. -Colonel FleweSmith  visited India at the request of the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of gaining experience. Whilst he was there he was the guest one evening of an Indian prince, who remarked, " I want to speak my mind to you to-night about Australia. I hope that you will not be offended if I talk straight."  Lt. -Colonel Smith  replied, " Certainly not," and the prince then went on to say, "My impression of the Australians is that they are arrant fools. I spend a lot of money in purchasing horses, and in maintaining a staff of servants, and I would like to visit Australia. But if I did so, I might be insulted, or my servants might be insulted, and certainly I would be asked to enter into a bond to take them out of Australia again. The result is that I do not go there. We respect Australia, but it is  Ma's ' 12-in. guns which make us do it. We are a nation of 250,000,000 souls, and yet a small insignificant nation like Australia, with a population of only 4,500,000, actually dictates to us. If it were not for  Ma's ' 12-in. guns, we would sweep you off the face of the earth." There is a great deal of food for thought in those statements. Then I recollect reading in one of the Brisbane newspapers some eight or nine months ago, certain remarks which were made by a Chinese who landed there, and who was subjected to the usual fingerprint examination. He resented that treatment, and pointing to a Russian who was on board, said, " They won't ask him for finger prints. Russia has too long guns. By-and-by China have long guns. Then no more white man in Australia." There we have another nation, numbering 400,000,000, against which we have to protect ourselves, and which, when thoroughly awakened, will prove to be a very formidable antagonist. When we further consider the proximity of other Powers like Japan, which could sweep us off the face of the earth, I say that we cannot afford to be other than loyal to the Empire. I was pleased to know that the Prime Minister was able to deny the interview that he was supposed to have had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> T. Stead just before he left Great Britain, and that the sentiments attributed to him were not his. When I read the report of the interview, I suspended judgment, but I could not help thinking of the oath which the Prime Minister had taken a few weeks previously. Side by side with it, the Stead interview makes interesting reading. As a Privy Councillor, the Prime Minister took the following oath - </para>

However, the incident, as the Prime Minister says, is closed, and for the honour and credit of Australia I am gratified that he was able to deny the interview. </para>

At any rate, he gave a different interpretation of his utterance. I am not quite sure that his party were not responsible for some of the interpretations of what the Prime Minister really meant. In Queensland, it was pretty freely reported that if the Government did not secure a mandate from the people to carry out their new Protection proposals they would introduce a Free Trade Tariff this session, and that that was what was going to cause many of us to fall down with fright. </para>

                        <para>- If it is a canard, it is one for which some of our friends opposite were responsible during the referenda campaign. However, that subject has been quite sufficiently discussed during this debate, and I have nothing further to say about it, except that I am pleased at the defeat of the Government proposals, and did my best to secure that result, as I should do again if the questions were submitted to the electors in the same form. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to say. The Treasurer takes credit for having issued something like  £9,000,000  of notes. I have heard that a great number of them were put to the current account of the Government. What appears to have happened is something like this : The banks said to the Treasury, " We want  £8,000,000  worth of notes; we will deposit  2,000,000  sovereigns with you, and give you credit for  6,000,000  more." The Government accepted those conditions. Then they said to the States, " We have money to lend ; we will lend it to you at  3!  per cent." Some of the States said, " We will accept short-dated loans on those terms." Thereupon the Commonwealth Government drew a cheque for the amount agreed upon, and the States were paid in Commonwealth notes. By-and-by we shall find that the Commonwealth will be paid back in its own notes. It appears to me that the whole business is not on sound lines. A temptation has been placed in the way of the Government into which I am afraid they have fallen, and from which they will have some difficulty in extricating themselves. I do not profess to be an authority on banking, but I know something about business, and it has always struck me that a sovereign is worth more than paper at any rate. </para>

                        <para>- We have not so many as we should like, but quite sufficient for carrying on good sound business without so large a resort to paper money. I am not condemning the use of paper money altogether, but I do think that the over-issue is a mistake for which the Government will be sorry. In regard to the Tariff, I am not at one with my honorable friend, the member for Lang. I do not desire to see a Free Trade Tariff by any means. But I would remind the Government that the enormous revenue which has been received from the Customs House during the last year is not likely to continue. There has been a wave of prosperity passing over Australia, for which we are all thankful ; and there has been a great shortage of labour, which has necessitated the importation of very many necessaries of life, and many articles which should be manufactured here, not because sufficient encouragement in that direction was not given, or that there was any serious impediment in the way of their manufacture, but simply because the demand was greater than the supply. We had to import these articles to an extent which increased the Customs revenue very considerably. But as we manufacture our own requirements, the revenue from that source must diminish. I would like to plead with the Minister, though he seems to take very little notice of our representations, to try to remove some of the anomalies in the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- When I speak of Tariff anomalies, I mean anomalies which arise sometimes through certain articles not being protected, and other articles, which are the raw material of certain industries, being too highly protected. I do not claim that I could frame a Tariff which would be satisfactory; indeed, it is not possible, I think, for the House, or any body of men, to do that ; but we should try to get as near perfection as possible. In order to attain that object, one would need to go into many details which, of course, do not suggest themselves in the course of a few moments. 1 consider that the Minister has. taken the right course in trying to get information. </para>

                        <para>- I admit, candidly, that the Minister has done the right thing. Whether he will succeed in obtaining the information which he desires or not, is another question. In order to make the Tariff perfect, we must get all the information we can, and get it from those who are engaged in the industries. We are not experts in every line of business; but we are experts in particular lines, and we can give information, for what it is worth, regarding those lines. The Minister is in a position to obtain information; and I hope that he will get it as speedily as he can, and, without any partisanship, do his best to make ours the most perfect Tariff in the world. With regard to bankruptcy, I am pleased to notice that that question is to receive some consideration this session, so that at last we may hope to have a Bankruptcy Act for Australia. This matter has engaged the attention of myself and others for a considerable time, and I think that the Government have received from the Congress of Chambers of Commerce a resolution asking that legislative action be taken as speedily as possible. When the question of trade marks is being dealt with - perhaps this is a matter for administration or regulation rather than for enactment - I hope that the absurd practice of requiring tradesmen to supply seven <inline font-style="italic">facsimiles</inline> of a trade mark before it is registered will be abolished. I have drawn attention to this practice before, and I would not mention it now except that I am reminded of it by a paragraph in the Speech. It is a hardship upon tradesmen that they have to incur the expense of preparing seven <inline font-style="italic">facsimiles</inline> of a trade mark before they can know if it is to be registered or not. I think there should be some means for a tradesman to find out, through the original, whether a trade mark can be registered without being put to a lot of expense. This is not a small item. In a case in which I was interested, it cost <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> to supply the <inline font-style="italic">facsimiles</inline> to the Patent Office, and then registration of the proposed trade mark was refused. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member, too, has a weakness in that direction. If a workable scheme of preferential voting could be devised, I should be only too pleased to favour it; but, as far as I have seen, not one of the principal schemes which have been put forward appears likely to produce the desired effect. They are open to manipulation, and very often persons are induced to throw away their preference votes in order to block the men who should get them. I hope that no time will be lost in arranging for a redistribution of seats. The census returns show that Queensland is entitled to another representative in this House, unless, as the Minister of Home Affairs said the other day, we have too many aliens. But I do not think that we have more, proportionately, than any other State. At the present time we have on the rolls 293,003 electors, and the quota for ten representatives would be 29,300. The Brisbane division has now on the roll 32,165 electors, or 2,865 above the quota; Capricornia, 32,774 electors, or 3,474 above the quota; Darling Downs, 34,774 electors, or 5,774 above the quota; Herbert, 39,614 electors, or 10,614 above the quota; Moreton, 33,295 electors, or 4,295 above the quota; Maranoa, 31,3 19 electors, or 2,319 above the quota ; Oxley, 32,908 electors, or 3,608 above the quota; Wide Bay, 33,210 electors, or 3,910 above the quota; Kennedy, with 22,974 electors, being the only division which has an enrolment below the quota, it being 6,028 below. The Government should, therefore, take immediate steps to bring the rolls up to date with a view to the proper distribution of seats. </para>

                <para>I was surprised to hear the Minister of Trade and Customs say that he has no control over the refrigerated space of vessels taking fruit from Tasmania. The matter may, perhaps, come more directly under the control of the Postmaster- General, but in the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company there is certainly the provision that each State shall be entitled to a <inline font-style="italic">pro raid</inline> proportion of the refrigerated space available. I hope that the honorable gentleman will inquire whether he has not power to require the use of separate chambers and air ducts for the carriage of apples, because these, if carried in the same chamber as butter, taint it seriously, reducing its value by about  2s.  a cwt. I hope, too, that the honorable gentleman will consent to alter the regulation which now requires that butter exported from Australia shall not contain more than  15  per cent, of moisture. The standard should be made what it was twelve months ago. At present at least two-thirds o.f the Australian butter sent to London is blended, so that it loses its identity. The honorable member for Richmond has gone fully into the matter, so that it is needless for me to occupy time by traversing the same ground again ; but if the Minister will not do what we ask, we must go to London, and do there what the regulation says must not be done here. The British public is willing to accept butter containing  16  per cent, of moisture, and the butter dealer in London makes a profit by increasing the moisture in the Australian butter, which is. sent away containing only  12  or  13  per cent, of moisture. </para>

                    (Gwydir)  £8.23].-  My original intention was not to take part in the debate, but since Friday I have been thinking over the speeches which have been made. I have never known so weak an attack to be made by an Opposition, and I propose to shortly review the main features of the criticism which we have heard, and of the policy contained in the Governor-General's Speech. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, was mysterious. He is regarded throughout the Commonwealth as the most mysterious politician who has ever held a prominent place in any country, and on this occasion he has been more mysterious than ever before. The honorable member had something to say about the Prime Minister's interview with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead,</inline>
                    of which so much has been made, and insinuated that the Prime Minister attempted to undermine the loyalty of Australia to the Mother Country. He did not say so in so many words, but those who listened to him could see clearly what he meant - so clearly that even the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    expressed the opinion that it would have been better for him to " strike out " and let the country, know what he was driving at, rather than wrap his meaning up in mysterious statements which in no way strengthened his position. Outside of that, in the very elaborate address - in which, as usual, he said nothing and explained nothing, and ended in making it difficult for those who listened to understand what was being talked about - the attack on the Leader of the Government calls for no comment. Subsequently we had the honorable member for Parkes, who at all times is listened to in this House with great attention. He gets an audience which no other honorable member gets, as a rule ; he waits until the House is in a condition to listen, and then he proceeds to lecture it.

                    <para>- No man can help enjoying the classic way in which the honorable member rounds his periods and endeavours to prove to the public that he knows something of the subject on which he is talking. It does not follow that the honorable member always does know something 'of the subject ; and the most remarkable fact is that, with his gigantic intellect, although he has been for many years in State and Commonwealth Parliaments, lecturing the House of which he happened to be a member, it is impossible to find from the records that his overshadowing and overpowering education and enlightenment have ever enabled him to do any. one thing " off his own bat." When we have a man posing as a supreme dictator, it is singular to find his political history a barren waste of platitude and superfine speeches that mean nothing. On the present occasion the honorable member laid himself out to criticise the Prime Minister and the members of the Imperial Conference. He quoted from newspapers a never-ending series of paragraphs which he had been assiduously cutting out ever since the delegates were appointed. He read one after another in order ito prove that the delegates had in some way not carried out the trust that this Parliament reposed in them. But the weak point in his attack lies in the fact that only four years ago, when his present leader, who was not his leader then, went Home on a similar mission, and made some of those loyal speeches of which only he is capable, the honorable member stood at the table of this House for five and three-quarter hours, doing nothing but 'flogging that gentleman just as severely as the other . night he tried to flog the present Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, 4he honorable member for Parkes was, on the previous occasion, more severe on his present leader than he has been on the present Prime Minister. If there is one thing that undermines the value of a man's criticism it is his inability to see any good "in either side in politics. It must be patent to every man who scrutinises the honorable member for Parkes that, in his own opinion, no one knows how to address himself to Imperial matters, or to approach those great questions of moment to the present and future of Australia, but himself. In his estimation, he is the only gentleman who should be selected to voice the aspirations of the Commonwealth whenever we require a preventable personage to appear before  His  Majesty, King George V. Following the honorable member for Parkes we had the gallant colonel, the honoraBle member for North Sydney. One desire that that gentleman had in his maiden speech in this Chamber was to impress honorable members with the fact that he is a military man. But we have only to look at the honorable member in order to see in him an embyro Kitchener. There is no need for any explanation ; he has the carriage and bearing of a great military authority. I am quite willing to concede, without any elaborate explanation from the honorable member, that 'he is the one man who is ready 'to face the music whenever the " social revolution,''' of which he talked, occurs in Australia. I have been told that "the speech which the honorable member delivered has been delivered, well,  a dozen, if not twenty, times before. That does not make any difference, so far as this Chamber is concerned ; it is the . first time he 'has .uttered !it here. I am of opinion that when he comes to criticise this Parliament, and its work, as pertaining to naval and military defence, he, though so great an authority, will not be able to pick many holes in what has been done by the present Administration. Then, we had the alarmist member, in the person of the honorable member for Grampians, who raved in the corner about what is going to take place if the Labour party carry out the policy they have enunciated. The honorable member told us what we had been told often before - though it is well to have it repeated, in case we forget - that if the Labour party remain in power, and are intrusted much longer with the conduct of the affairs of the country, there will be a crisis at no distant date which will spell ruin, not only to vested interests, but to every citizen who has a claim to be considered an Australian. He tells us that capital is going to leave the country, and that, unless we can make some new arrangement between capital and labour, we shall shortly surfer a severe catastrophe. The old " gag " that has been used against the Labour party from time immemorial, was rehearsed again and again by the honorable member to his own satisfaction, and, I am sure, to the satisfaction of the members of the party to which he belongs. Then we had the honorable member for Wimmera, who was strong on the effect of the land tax. He tried to show that the tax has not reduced the value of land, and has not made land accessible to the public, but that, on the contrary, values have been increased. But the honorable member's argument proves nothing. The land tax has not yet had a fair trial j but when it does, within the next two or three years, I am certain that the people of Australia will realize the wisdom of the measure more than they do at the present time. It is because of this that the Opposition begin to talk of its being effective. I could take them to various parts of New South Wales, where land has long been locked up, and show them surveyors' pegs all over the place, as well as " for sale" boards indicating the desire of people who have hitherto held the land in large areas to subdivide it so as to escape the burden of the tax. I fully anticipate that one of the effects of the land tax will be a reduction in land values. My belief is that it will bring down the price of land to something like its use value, and do away altogether with purely speculative values. I am not going to say that I did not think the tax would cause a decrease in values, because that would not be a fair position to take up. The lamentations with which the honorable member for Wilmot indulged this afternoon in regard to absentee companies, and the effect of the tax upon them, serve only to support my contention that this law, as we expected, is causing the absentee landholder to disgorge the land he has hitherto monopolized, and that it will ultimately make it available at a reasonable working value to those who will use it. During this debate, we have also listened to the honorable member for Richmond, who, in his own artful way, dealt with the bank note issue, and our proposal to establish a National Bank. He did his work artfully, but also, I admit, artistically, and exhibited a rather better grasp of figures than some members of the Opposition have shown during this debate. I do not say, however, that he was correct in all his contentions. Indeed, we do not expect the Opposition to be too careful of their facts when they are denouncing us, or advocating their own policy. No doubt, the honorable member was right, however, in indicating that the note issue is capable of being manipulated adversely to the interests of the Government that established the system, lt seems to me that an error of judgment was committed with respect to the safeguards with which that note issue ought to have been surrounded, and I fear that, as the result of that error of judgment, we .shall experience some difficulty when we require to take charge of the note issue in connexion with the institution that we hope to bring into existence during the present year. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking of the question of loans. Then we had the tireless-wireless man from Fremantle - the honorable member who makes a study of wireless telegraphy. He has been endeavouring to show the House that the negotiations between the Government and the company alleged to be controlling in Australia a system of wireless telegraphy not favoured by the British Admiralty, are not exactly clear. The original syndicate has been floated into a limited liability company, with a capital of about £65/000. The Postmaster-General has told us that these gentlemen have no rights in regard to wireless telegraphy in Australia other than the right to erect two stations under a contract which they have entered into with the Government. If that is so, what have they to sell, and what are the shareholders going to receive for their money ? The Telefunken system is not the sole property of the company that claims to control it ir&gt;. Australia. There are other connexions that have not been made clear to the House. The company has alleged that the Indian Army and several of the Departments of the Government of India are entering into contracts for the use of the Telefunken system. I have it on the best authority, however, that there is no truth in the statement. It is by the circulation of such reports that the company is trying to popularize a system which is not indorsed by the Admiralty, and is not safe from attack in the Law Courts. The facts, as far as we know them, show that representations are being made that cannot be upheld. </para>

                        <para>- A statement to that effect was made after the close of last session, but I believe that it was merely a newspaper canard. I have no information' to show that there has been any consolidation of the interests of the two companies. As a matter of fact, since the announcement was made, the Marconi Company has proceeded against one of its competitors for an infringement of its patent, and has secured an injunction restraining, that competitor from operating in the future. If the Marconi Company chose to test the validity of the so-called rights of the Telefunken Company in Australia the result might be that which attended the legal proceedings in the Old Country.. A wireless telegraphy expert has arrived in Australia. He is, I believe a young man selected by some of our people at' Home, I suppose, on recommendations. He may be all right, but in a matter such as that of wireless telegraphy, which is going to be of" paramount importance in the days to come as a means of communication among the nations, we should not be prevented by the expenditure of .a few pounds from getting the very best experience and skill that the world is able to offer. We have suffered enough already in our Postal Service by taking what is cheap in preference to what is valuable - valuable, not so much in the matter of money, as in the matter of experience which we have not been able to secure from the servants of the Commonwealth hitherto. I wish to refer to the question of automatic telephones, although I would prefer that the Postmaster-General had been present. I was a little surprised to learn that the Government had found it necessary to enter upon an experiment at Geelong to test the utility of the automatic telephone system. When the Postal Commission was sitting, the matter had not sufficiently developed for us to come to any conclusion about it, or even to realize its practicability or otherwise, but since that time great strides have been made in America, and from the accounts that I have read the system has been put into operation with great success in many of the towns. It is claimed that the system is quite as economical as the old one, and gives the public a far more effective service. We on the Postal Commission thought that in matters of this kind the Department should always be on the lookout for any improvements effected in other parts of the world in any of the services for which it is responsible, and we recommended that the trusted officers of the Department should be kept in touch with postal, telegraphic, and telephonic doings all over the world, so that Australia might not lag behind. What surprised me, therefore, was that the Postmaster-General had started an experiment at Geelong instead of following the lines that we suggested. It would have been possible for him to inaugurate an investigation in America, where it is claimed that the automatic system has been perfected. He might have sent thither an officer whom he could trust to investigate the subject on the spot, and in that way have secured first-hand knowledge. Instead of that, we are going on in the old way which was followed for many years in the Commonwealth and in the States. We are going to enter upon a series of experiments. </para>

                        <para>- I am not satisfied with that. The Commonwealth has a service that is differently situated from the services in most parts of the Old World. It is practically State Socialism that is controlling our. Postal Service, and we should not shelter ourselves behind the crusted ideas and conservative inclinations of older countries when the position of the service for which, we are responsible is being criticised. We ought to have something vastly superior to the Old Country if we are to be up-to-date. We are to haw an experiment of the automatic telephone system at Geelong. If it turns out well, it will simply prove that, at a small exchange, with a limited number of subscribers, the system may be worked successfully. lt will not solve the problem at all for us, but may simply lead us on to more experiments, which may or may not be successful. </para>

                        <para>- From a telephonic stand-point, it is only a third or four-class town. A system that is applicable to a small exchange may prove only a delusion and a snare when an attempt is made to apply it to an exchange with from ten to twelve thousand subscribers and a multitude of wires connected with the central exchange, such as is the case in Sydney. If the system is working successfully in America, and we could get the information by sending a man there, it is false economy to go on experimenting here. </para>

I hope we shall deal, not merely with sectional issues, but with the big question which, whether we like it or not, will force itself upon the attention of the House, until it is settled in a manner creditable to all concerned. I shall not, at this stage, discuss postal matters any further. .1 intend later on to deal, if not with every phase, with every important phase, of the subject.

                        <para>- It does not matter how long it will take. If the result is to enable the honorable member for Richmond to give an intelligent vote on the question, the time will be well spent. No matter what time is occupied, the subject will have to be dealt with, and every hour and every month the settlement of it is delayed will but add to the difficulty of dealing with it. With regard to other matters, I am satisfied that the programme put forward by the Government will, if given effect to, reflect credit on the party they represent, and the Parliament they have trie honour at the present time to control. There are (measures foreshadowed in the programme which must be passed if we are to derive the benefits we anticipated from the imposition of land values taxation. Effective land settlement cannot be expected to follow the imposition of the land tax unless we take control, not merely of the note circulation, but of the banking business generally of Australia, and so be hi a position to relieve the men who will take up land, freed for settlement as a result of the imposition of the land tax, from the oppression of the money monopolists. A number of people in Australia are awaiting an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Decisions adverse to the interests of a large proportion of the working people of the Commonwealth will be met by the measure promised in the Governor-General's Speech, so far as our constitutional powers will permit. If it be shown that we have not the constitutional power necessary to make the required alterations in the law, we shall be only the better able to justify our position when we again submit proposals to the people to give us the powers essential for the future good government of the country. I have heard honorable members opposite glory in the fact that they won at the referenda. I remember that the honorable member for Flinders supported our referenda proposals in this House, and said that, general! v speaking, the powers asked for were necessary for the good government of Australia. It was only when it was proposed to include railway servants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the honorable gentleman found any reason to object to the proposals. However, during the referenda campaign, we found the honorable gentleman telling the people from the platform, in the logical manner characteristic of him, that our proposals would bring " blue ruin " on the country if they were adopted. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but I wish to be as concise as possible; and the honorable gentleman's words implied that &lt;: blue ruin" would follow the adoption of our proposals. What, after all, did honorable members opposite succeed in doing? Surely they cannot regard the result of the referenda as a victory for them? In view of the differences of opinion expressed by members of this House in discussing the referenda proposals, it may be said that, although honorable members are supposed to be at least students of the constitutional changes proposed from time to time, they did not fully comprehend the effect of the proposals submitted. How, then, could we expect the public at large to understand the great changes involved in those proposals? We can look upon the last referenda campaign as merely a stage in the education of the people. We may- hope to do much better when the Labour party have a press of their own, and the control of newspapers that will put a correct interpretation upon their acts and proposals. During the last campaign we were at the mer&gt;-y of the monopolistic press of this country, and never, in all our experience, were we subjected to such a united attack of misrepresentation and slander as we .were in connexion with the questions submitted to the people on the  26th  April last. </para>

                        <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> is only a weekly paper, and could have but little effect in counteracting the misrepresentations of the daily press in each of the States. But the workers have learned a lesson from the defeat of their proposals last year. They realize to-day what they knew to a certain extent before, that it is of no use to try to fight without weapons, or with unequal weapons. We must have a press to voice our opinions and. aspirations, and place our views fairly before the people, and to correct such misrepresentations and refute such slanders as were hurled at us and our doings by the daily press, and party politicians, in pursuance of the tactics adopted by the other side at the last referenda campaign. I am satisfied that, when the questions are submitted to the people again, we shall secure the votes of those who refrained from going to the poll on the last occasion. The honorable member for Parramatta apparently derives some little consolation from a comparison of figures in connexion with the voting at the referenda in my electorate. I can tell the honorable member that the votes cast against the proposals did not nearly equal the number of votes cast for my opponent at the last election. It is, therefore, possible that the honorable gentleman has discovered a mare's nest when he regards the voting at the referenda as an indication of a change in the political views of the electors I have the honour to represent. The same remark is applicable to many of the New South Wales electorates. Tha Labour party have received a warning. They have learned that apathy means defeat, and when we take the field again, the Liberal party will find that each and every member of our organization will fight solidly for the propositions that we intend to put before the people. </para>

                        <para>- I warned honorable members opposite in time. I do not like to take any man unawares. I recognised the danger which confronted them, and although they had sorely oppressed me in the days gone by, I was too much of a Christian to be unkind to them. At least, I showed them an example of Christian conduct. I warned them of the wrath to come. In that memorable speech which I made in this Chamber, I pointed out five honorable members, and predicted that after that Parliament had ceased to exist, their services would be no longer required in these legislative halls. None of them came back. They would not heed my warning, and so Nemesis overtook them, and they ceased to exist politically. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member desires me to be a little too previous. I will not torture them while they are here! It will be sufficient for me to indicate them later on. But I say, without fear of contradiction, that unless they mend their ways quite a number of my honorable friends opposite will never come back here. I refer particularly to those honorable members - like the honorable member for Parkes and the honorable member for Wakefield - who are opposed to the establishment of a Commonwealth bank,  and who rave about revolution. They preach the sanguinary doctrine that if the people do what is necessary for their own salvation, there will be a bloody revolution in this country such as was never equalled in France. Who would ever have dreamed of the honorable member for Wakefield entertaining revolutionary ideas? Who would ever have imagined that within the placid bosom of the honorable member tor Parkes there beats a heart which is thirsting for blood ? We have no cause to tear the result of the next referendum, because we shall win by a majority such as we are accustomed to command when we enter into a political contest after having prepared the way for action. Honorable members opposite may talk all night about Labour legislation, organization, and administration, but they are only digging their own graves. They have failed to realize that the workers of Australia are no longer to be handled as they were by the Conservatives of old ; are no longer to be moulded into any shape to suit the purposes of parties who wish to use them. The workers of to-day are benefiting from the education system that was grudgingly and reluctantly established in days gone by. The schoolmaster is abroad, and from the moment when the workers grasp the principles of economics and social science, the arguments of the other side become of no avail. That is a fact that honorable members opposite do not count upon. They are not in touch with the Democracy. The right honorable member for Swan has been telling us that the Labour Government is" not going fast enough. He expected to see the Capital city established by the time he returned from England. He wanted to know why we had not constructed a railway vo take people quickly to the Capital, and bring them back again. I may inform him that the Labour party do not profess to perform miracles. They propose to carry out their programme as common-sense men in a manner that will do credit to them and be of advantage to the people. I can quite understand that the right honorable member for Swan should try to rush us into the middle of a current where we might be swept away, by encouraging us to enter into a huge borrowing policy for the pursuit of this or that policy believed to be necessary for the development of Australia. Personally, I should not care a rap if we never made any progress with the Capital in the position in which it is located. I am not speaking from an electoral stand-point, or because the Capital area is within my own electorate, though I admit that that would be the best place in the world for it to be. .1 was, however, too modest to recommend its establishment there. I am not saying this because the <inline font-style="italic">Agc,</inline> or some other newspaper, is opposed to the Yass-Canberra site. I did my best to oppose that site up to the time when a choice had to be made of the lesser of two evils, and I had to select between that site and another which I disliked still more. I say now that if the Federal Government were never established at Yass-Canberra it would be better for Australia, provided we were assured of a site with a more genial climate, better surroundings, better water supply, better landscape - in fact, better everything - than are to be found at Yass-Canberra. </para>

But since it has been settled they have been remarkably quiet on the subject. They turn round and say, " It is only right that it should be settled, and we are in favour of justice being done to the men equally with honorable members on that side." </para>

He can also find confirmation in the Sydney newspapers when they are not thinking of fighting or anything of that kind, and are, by accident, performing the function which they arc supposed at all times to perform, namely, that of conveying to the public truthful information. The honorable member for Flinders knows more about this matter than I do. I have not been one of the organizers of the Liberal party. I have not been one of those who have been voting away money.I have not been in the same position as the ex-Premier of New South Wales, who is alleged to have  been paid during his opposition to the referendum. It is commonly understood, in fact, it was stated in the press, and so far as I know the statement has not been contradicted, that he was paid by the Employers' Federation a salary per year to light the battle of the so-called Liberals, but, in reality, the money-bags and Tories of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I know that all over New South Wales organizers are, and have been, doing work permanently in some cases, and spasmodically in others, at salaries of <inline font-style="italic">£6, £4</inline> and £3 10s. a week. I want to know from my honorable friends on the other side where they got the money to pay these salaries, the thousands of pounds which they spent on the literature with which they swamped the State, the money to engage the large number of motor cars which they ran in connexion with the referendum, and which were not hired for nothing, and the large number of lady organizers whom they were able to control, and to use at propaganda work. I want the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to tell me where this money came from, and who is meeting the heavy cost of the organization? </para>

                        <para>- Then, the honorable member can excuse my curiosity, when 1 look across at those who have no respect for law and order. If you want an example of what can be done by Liberalism in New South Wales, read the newspapers to-morrow morning. To-day the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly had to bring in the police to remove five members by force, in order that the business of the country might proceed in a respectable way. I wish that the honorable member for Parkes were here to-night for me to read' to him an object-lesson on law and order, not one taken from a book based on theoretical considerations, but one founded on a concrete fact. Rome met its doom when its leaders began to show their weakness, and had to be removed from the places which, instead nf honouring, they had defiled. Fancy these men leading the great Liberal party today! When the honorable member for Parramatta opens tomorrow's newspaper, he will be sorry that he was not in Sydney to go bail for those men who have had to be put nut of the StateAssembly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis.</inline> I remember that gentleman well. He used to stand in this Chamber and tell us what an independent patriot he was. A man who did not know the person whom the Government of that day had sent Home to represent them ! He was surprised that it was some one named Foxton who had been sent Home, while he himself had been left here. What mysterious ways Providence has for meting out justice to those who deserve, it ! Hereis <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> to-day doing more to put the true brand on Liberalism than has been clone by any one else. There is not a man on this side who is not prepared to stand with his face to the foe, and to give battle with all the vigour and courage that come from honest conviction and determination to do the right. But in New South Wales the Liberals are prepared to strangle constitutional government, to beat down authority under their feet, and to try to humiliate the highest officer in Parliament in the face of his fellows. I look upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> as a visitation. I am very glad he left here. He is in the right place, and where it was intended that he should be. He has put the brand on Liberalism, and has taught the Liberals what true liberty means. He is laying down a code of honour which will last when he himself has been forgotten. This gentleman, who was such an ornament here in years gone by, is a greater ornament in the position which he holds today. He said that he was in the front ranks of Liberalism, and a Radical. If he was in the forefront of Liberalism, as I believe he was, how much in the rear are nil the others ! Honorable members opposite should derive a lesson from what is occurring in New South Wales. It may react on them if the change of parties which they say will take place a year and nine months from now occurs. There are two things that end a cause that is doomed : the insincerity of its adherents, and the fact that its supporters stand aghast at the things that are clone in its name. The Liberals cannot say anything against the programme of measures to be brought in to insure the welfare of the people which is set down in the Governor-General's Speech. There is nothing in their criticism. We h:\ve no need to be afraid of the remnants of the party that opposed us in the past. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to take the advice of an austere supporter of the honorable member, who said the other day that he would not reply to interjections so that he could erase them from his <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs. I am not going to answer his interjections. He has made his speech, and in making it did not hesitate to say hard things about the Attorney-General, and to dig up almost every opinion that that gentleman has expressed in the fighting days of the past. I say of the Attorney-General, " May his shadow never grow less." He was a giant in the fight that recently took place, fighting, not with kid gloves, but with the determination of a man seized of the value of the reform that he sought, and of the position that he desired to obtain. And what had the honorable member to say against the Attorney-General ? Read the speeches made during the referenda. Can any one wonder that some person should become the mouthpiece of the Labour party who could get at least a little space in the newspapers to show the real meaning of the proposition before the people? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Lang has not spoken yet, but I have no doubt that when he does, we shall get a rather advanced statement of the aspirations of the Liberals. I hope the honorable member will be able to throw some light on the effect that travel and observation have had on him in the Old World. He may be able to explain what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> has said, and reveal to us those mysterious factors that are responsible for the communications which appear in the press from time to time. He may be able to indicate the way in which his party is going to be preserved and saved from the wrath of the people at the next election. The honorable member for Grampians smiles - that is all that is left for him to' do, and he is wise in smiling when he can. I saw the honorable member the other night, when he was speaking ; and if ever there was a man, to all appearance, on the verge of suffering from some fatal malady, it was the honorable member when he was trying to convince the House of the dire results that would follow the policy of the Labour party. The honorable member desires to know what we are going to do with the labourer and the employer. He wishes to bring them together, and so do we; but the honorable member wishes to bring them together under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> that has hitherto existed. He is in favour of Wages Boards. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a recommendation, any way; but I do not desire to know what any of the Irvines did in another place; I leave that to their own conscience. The honorable member has no need to be afraid of the Labour party. I do not, and I never did, favour Wages Boards. I do not believe in craft unionism, which, in my opinion, will be used to burst up the organization necessary to bring about the emancipation of the workmen of this country. Wages Boards are a subtle means, on the one hand, of undermining arbitration, and, on the other hand, the broader system of unionism, as it will be. and as it is expounded by authorities. I have no desire to labour the question. I compliment the Government on the manner in which they have administered the Departments during the time we have been in recess. I compliment the Postmaster-General, and the officers under him, for having, during recess, taken as their guidance at least some portions of the report of the Postal Commission, as placed before them at the end of last session. I compliment (hem on having adopted many of the recommendations,, an action which has had the effect, at any rate, of allaying serious trouble in the Department. I do not mean to say that this partial adoption of the recommendations has cured the trouble, because it has only allayed it. I compliment the Public Service Commissioner, who has found it necessary during the recess to change his policy and methods of administration, so as to bring it almost into line with the recommendations of the report, to which he did not give his adhesion when laying his evidence before the Commission. I compliment that gentleman, nevertheless, as I would any man who repents and tries to do better. In the Post and Telegraph Department much has been done, and I am hopeful that more will be done. I hope that the Postmaster-General will find where the cancer is in the Department, and will not handle it in a delicate way, but that he will take a lance, and cut it out by the roots, so that we shall get rid of an element which has undermined proper administration, and prevented a satisfactory solution of the difficulties which have presented themselves. I take no credit away from him, but give him all the credit that is his due. The decks have been cleared, as it were, of a few, or a number of, minor difficulties, and the Department placed on a somewhat better basis. I understand that this year  £250,000  has been spent in giving increased wages to the employes in the postal service, and in providing an increased staff to cope with the work that has to be performed. In addition, I am told that  £70,000  has been spent in procuring additional temporary assistance. This means  £320,000  distributed to bring this Department to the, I was going to say, perfection in which we find it to-day. But what position would the Department have been in if this money had not been available, and if extra assistance had not been procured ? I give every credit to those who found the money, and, while increasing the staff, raised the remuneration of the lower paid officers in an endeavour to bring about a more equitable return for the value of the services rendered. So 'much has been done ; but it is what has not been done that I desire Ministers to think over before the whole matter has to be discussed in this House. Later, when I discuss the question more fully, I shall be able to show that the Department will never succeed under the present system of organization and" administration, and that it cannot by any possibility reflect that credit upon us, or give the service to the public that they are entitled to expect, until, and unless, we adopt business methods, and place in charge of each section of the Department a man who understands the business of the section, who will be able to advise the responsible Minister without reference to any other person, and will speak with the authority of an expert. We want in charge of each branch a man who will be able to lay down his position in such a way that the Minister will be able to say, " This is the advice of an officer who is qualified to express an opinion " rather than that of an officer, who has not even had a training in the important branches of the service, and therefore cannot be qualified to bring to bear upon his task that ripened judgment so necessary to the effective control of a great Department. </para>

                    ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) f°-55]- - Before the honorable member for Gwydir leaves the chamber, I should like to ask him whether he is prepared to repeat outside this House the reflections that fie has made to-night upon the honour of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade.</inline>
                    Rx-Premier of New South Wales and the present Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of that State - reflections which he has not attempted in the least degree to substantiate. I think it will be admitted that throughout this debate no member of the Opposition has descended to the level of attacking an absent person, and reflecting upon his honour, knowing that that person had no chance of reply. I sincerely hope that no honorable member of our party will ever oe guilty, either inside or outside the Parliament, of such a practice. Indeed, I can conceive of nothing more despicable than the action of a man, who takes advantage of his position as a member of Parliament and the privilege and immunity that he enjoys in this House, to make a personal attack upon the honour of an outside person, more especially when that person holds one of the highest positions in the land. It is a cowardly thing to do.

                    <para>- I shall do so, in deference to your ruling, sir. The debate on this side of the House, has "been conducted throughout upon legitimate political lines. It has been maintained on a very high level, and I deeply regret that an honorable member opposite should have descended to the making of statements of a character that ought never to have been uttered. I only ask that that honorable member will give the gentleman whom he "has attacked an opportunity to clear himself of the aspersions that have been cast upon him. Seeing that leaders of his own party in New South Wales - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen Mr. Holman,</inline> and others- took exactly (he same stand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> did in regard to the referenda, does the honorable member for Gwydir suggest that they, too, received bribes from the same source - that they received consideration for their services, in opposing the referenda proposals? In attempting to fasten such a charge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> he implicates those members of his own party ; and it is only fair to ask him to repeat his statements in such a place as will enable the subjects of his reflections to refute them, and to call him to account for making them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> is generally recognised as a gentleman whose probity, integrity, and honour are unimpeachable. We have also to meet nonsensical allegations as to misrepresentation and slander on the part of the Opposition in this Parliament - in connexion with the referenda in April last. If such misrepresentations and slanders did take place, then our attitude was only on a par with that of the honorable member for Gwydir's own colleagues and leaders of his own party in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable member will deal with that matter when he speaks. When the honorable member for Gwydir was revealing to our astonished gaze the unsuspected halo which, according to him, adorns his head as a Christian martyr and as a prophet, I could not help wondering why he failed to bring to bear, before the 26th April last, the gifts of prophecy with which he claims to be so heavily endowed. Had he done so, he might have saved his party and himself from the dire disaster that overtook them. He must then have been singularly lacking in those gifts of prevision which he now claims, otherwise he would have used them to save himself and his party from one of the most severe rebuffs and castigations that has ever been inflicted by an outraged people upon a party claiming to represent them. Passing away from that question, let me say that, on returning to Australia .after the Coronation festivities, I was surprised to find still in office a party that had received at the hands of the electors the most emphatic vote of no-confidence ever cast against any political party. The Labour party were defeated by an enormous majority upon referenda proposals which they had declared to be imperatively necessary to enable them to give effect to the policy upon which they were elected ; and in the light of that knowledge - knowing that they had received such a vote of no-confidence- I could not understand how they came to be still in possession of the Treasury benches. No self-respecting party - no Government worthy of the name - would in such humiliating circumstances have held on to office for a moment longer than was absolutely necessary. </para>

                        <para>- It was  8.000  at the referendum. My majority was a great deal larger at the general election than were some of the majorities on the honorable member's side, and, even though it might have been somewhat diminished through the misrepresentations and the slanders of the honorable member's party, it was vindicated when the referendum was taken, and came back to its  8,000  once more. To my astonishment, then, I found that the Government were still clinging like limpets to a rock to the fees, emoluments, and sweets of office, and I am quite satisfied that it will take a considerably greater force than the defeat of the referenda to drag them from their positions. I regret it for the sake of the reputations of our parliamentary institutions, and am sure that no other Government in any part of the world would have continued to hold office in those humiliating circumstances. I am very glad, however, that the Prime Minister and his colleagues and the parliamentary delegation went Home, because I am satisfied that those visits will be productive of much good to Australia in a number of ways. They did good in the way of removing mutual misconceptions between the people of the Motherland and the people of Australia through their parliamentary representatives. I am very glad to see the growth of the Imperial sentiment among some members of what I prefer to call the Labour-Socialistic party. I do not know how that growth of the Imperial sentiment will appeal to some of the organizations upon whom the Prime Minister and his party rely so largely for support, but I am sure it" will appeal to those who hold, as I do, that the ties of unity with the Imperial Government are our surest safeguard from aggression from outside, and our greatest guarantee of progress towards commercial, industrial, social, and political prosperity. I desire to quote from the London <inline font-style="italic">Morning Post</inline> of the 31st May the admirable sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in regard to the Imperial connexion.

                        <para>- lt is a very nice picture, and  1  hope it may have the effect of concentrating some attention on Australia, but it is useless to advertise this country unless means are provided ito bring people here from the Old Land, lt is useless to say what a beautiful and productive country Australia is unless a genuine effort is made to bring settlers here. lt is. admitted on all hands that population is necessary for our self-preservation alone, to look at it from no other stand-point. If we are to hold this country secure from foreign invasion, we must people the great empty spaces that mark the map. We must bring millions of people here, and, as a preliminary, we must see that our coastal regions are fairly well settled and populated, because population there is of far greater value from a defence point of view than <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnoughts,</inline> cruisers or destroyers. We are not going the right way about the advertising of Australia. Honorable members who were present in London during the Coronation will bear me out in indorsing what the honorable member for Grey said about the exhibition he saw al the Festival of Empire at the Crystal Palace. The honorable member briefly outlined a portion of the picture, and I propose to finish some of the details of it. There was provided there a large court for the exhibition of Australian products for the purpose of giving the hundreds of thousands of visitors to London from all parts of the world on that great historic occasion, some idea of what Australia is, and can produce. When some of us entered this building we naturally expected to find a great deal there, but imagine our surprise on entering the great hall to see that it was absolutely empty of anything that was really calculated to give a fair idea of what Australia can produce or is like. After wandering around the room we noticed a bil of a map on the wall  at  one end, and then some one in the building called our attention  tG a  couple of dozen of very shrivelled and ill-used Tasmanian apples displayed on  a  little deal shelf. About two dozen were thus displayed, and there were a few more unpacked in an open case, revealing signs of considerable wear and tear. That was the Australian exhibit in that large hall, and I was informed that even those apples would not have been there but that the Tasmanian Agent-General had lent them at the request of one of the officials. We were told that we would see something better in another room. We went into the other room, and saw what purported to represent Australia there. We saw a picture which suggested that Australia was a land of bushrangers and thirst-perishers. On one side of the room there was a very badly executed tableau representing the Kelly gang of bushrangers, and just opposite, another representing  a  dying prospector or explorer with the remains of a camel lying stark under a blistering blazing hot sun upon a sandy desert. In the circumstances, it was not at all surprising that visitors passing through the Australian Court into the Canadian Court, and seeing the magnificent pictures and specimens of the products of rural and domestic life exhibited there should, if they had any idea of leaving the Mother Country, have their minds turned from Australia, and in the direction of Canada. </para>

                    <para>- No, we desire that the truth should be told about Australia, and no more. But we do not desire that Australian conditions should be caricatured, and the country maligned pictorially or otherwise. I say that what we saw at the Crystal Palace was a most damaging and unfair advertisement of Australia, and, if possible, steps should be taken to correct the impression which it must have created in the minds of visitors to the Festival of Empire. " I understand that it is proposed to send the wattle picture Home as an advertisement for Australia, and while it may be of some service we could do much more good by the exhibition of some genuine pictures of our industries, rural and otherwise, on the lines adopted by the Canadian Government, so as to give the agricultural sections of the community at Home a correct idea of the various branches of farming as carried on in Australia. It is the people of the agricultural districts of the Mother Country that we need to attract to Australia. We can get the people who earn their living in the cities at any time. If the country is prosperous the cities will be prosperous. If we can secure a comfortable rural population profitably employed in producing from Mother earth, and utilizing the raw forces of Nature in our primary industries, we can be quite sure that later on we shall have no trouble in getting enough people in our cities to supply the wants of those who are engaged in developing our country districts. The bad impression created by the exhibition to which I have referred was not softened down bv the recollection of the refusal of the present Government to offer a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to the Mother Country, and to take advantage of the opportunity afforded for the erection of a Coronation arch on the line of the Coronation procession, where hundreds of thousands of people from all parts of the world were passing day after day. That would not have involved any great expense, but whatever it cost it would have been a magnificent advertisement for Australia. As it was, a false impression was created that we in Australia were not too strong in the Empire sentiment. This bad impression was still further emphasized by the refusal of the Government to do as all the other British Possessions did, and send Home a Coronation contingent to take its part in that great pageant of Empire which took place on the occasion of the King's Coronation. That refusal was very adversely commented upon. </para>

                        <para>- I did, but unfortunately the people at Home did not. What we desire is that the people whom we wish to attract to Australia! should know the facts. It was the business of the Government to see that they were correctly informed, and they would have been carrying out only the wishes of the people of Australia if they had expended; a little money in the way to which I have referred. It was an additional humiliation to me to see the Prime Minister of Australia dependent upon the good-will and courtesy of the Prime Minister of Canada for a lift in that gentleman's carriage, escorted by Canadian troops, to take his place in the Coronation procession. Do honorable members think that that undignified exhibition of Australia's Prime Minister was a good thing for Australia, or a good way to advertise this country? </para>

                        <para>- It certainly had the appearance of giving a hard-up pal a compassionate lift, but was not the kind of advertisement calculated to raise us in the estimation of the people of other lands, or increase our prestige in the minds of the people of any part of the world. I was very sorry, indeed, to see it, and I hope that on a similar occasion such a thing will never occur again. I noticed that our Prime Minister very graciously acknowledged the cheers which were being sent up for the gentleman to whose courtesy he was indebted for a seat. While the cheers were going up for the Prime Minister Canada, our own Prime Minister was acknowledging them. That was not the only humiliation awaiting me.. </para>

These things do not reflect credit upon Australia. It is a disgrace to the Government that the Commonwealth should be subjected to that kind of reflection upon the people's loyalty, patriotism, and generosity. I am glad to note that since the termination of the Coronation festivities an interest has been taken in the cadets by the King and Queen that, in the face of our own Government's unfriendly attitude, could not sooner have been evinced in that quarter, and that the lads have been accorded some recognition. I am pleased to know that, although they were prevented from receiving medals whilst they were in London, they are to get them through the Imperial representative here. Of course, they would have been very much more satisfied had they received those medals at the hands of the King himself. To my mind the lads were treated shamefully, and it is to the credit of the Premier of New South Wales that he recognised that fact and came to their rescue without regard to the part of the Commonwealth from which they hailed. He acted rightly in supplying them with the wherewithal to return to Australia. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Private enterprise had no right to be called upon to defray the expenses of those cadets in the first place, and, in the second, the subscribers and the public were quite unaware of what was transpiring at Home. The lads were not allowed to join in the Coronation ^procession, but were merely allotted standing places along the line of march. It was not the wish of the people of Australia that that should be so, nor, if I am rightly informed, the wish of the British authorities. The people are not mean or niggardly in their conception of what is due to the Mother Country on such an historic occasion. They would have been delighted if a sum had been placed on the Estimates for the purpose of sending a contingent of troops Home to represent us, and to prevent our cadets from being financially embarrassed. </para>

                        <para>- But, seeing that each part of the Empire wishes to rival its neighbour, we ought to enter into that friendly rivalry ourselves. I wish to see all the Dominions develop, .but I do not wish to see them develop at the expense of Australia. I desire Australia to be developed by the best class of Britishers. These are the sentiments which I hold in regard to immigration. On my journey home I passed through Canada, and I was not altogether impressed with the type of a large proportion of the immigrants who find their way there. I found that a great number of Russians, Poles, Greeks, and other foreigners were being admitted, and these did not seem to be the best type of people, even of their nationalities. I was very sorry to see such emigration encouraged. It cannot be good for the future of Canada, and it certainly would not be good for us. I should be one of .the first to" rebel against the encouragement of the immigration of peoples of that type. It would be better to remain as we are than to have them, because I realize that, in  course of time, some of these people might turn out to be a source of danger rather than of assistance. Coming to the Gover-  nor-General's Speech, one of the first things to which I wish to refer is the Naval Agreement. It is stated - </para>

                    <para>The Naval Agreement arrived at after Conference between the Commonwealth representatives and the Admiralty is extremely satisfactory, embodying the policy formulated by the Government and approved by the people of the Commonwealth. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I wish to challenge the correctness of a portion of that statement. I believe that the policy was approved by the people of the Commonwealth, but I deny that it was formulated by this Government. It was formulated by their predecessors. It is substantially the policy of the late Government, and bears not the slightest resemblance to the original policy laid down by the party now in power. It would be only common honesty to admit as much, and not to claim credit for something for which the Government is not entitled to the slightest tittle of credit. The naval defence scheme was formulated by the Liberal Government. Like many other of the measures of that Government, it was found that it could not be improved upon, and that it was the best thing for Australia. Consequently it has been adopted, notwithstanding the most strenuous opposition of members of the Labour party when the policy was originally put before the people. Passing over two or three clauses of the Governor-General's Speech, which are simply padding and immaterial, I come to paragraph  10,  which deals with the operation of the Australian Notes Act. I am not prepared to say whether the operations of the Act have been satisfactory or otherwise. There seems to be an uneasy feeling, even amongst the supporters of the Government, that the Act 5s not so good a piece of legislation as it is claimed to be. That feeling of uneasiness was indicated by the honorable member for Gwydir.  His  remarks pointed to the belief that there is something' radically wrong about it somewhere. Perhaps he did not know where, but he seemed to believe in his mind that the measure was not so sound a thing as the members of the Government pretend. I see, from the Governor-General 's Speech, that the question of amending the Act in order to extend its usefulness is receiving attention. There was a paragraph In one of the newspapers stating that it was the intention of the Government to issue a very much larger number of these pieces  i:f  paper, which have been described as " Fisher's flimsiest." It was said that the gold reserve was not to be increased in .accordance with the terms of the Act, but that some attempt would be made to reduce it to  25  per cent., or even less - if not, indeed, to do away with it altogether. I am not in the confidence of the Government, and do not know whether there was any foundation in fact for this newspaper paragraph, but I do express the hope that nothing of the kind will be done. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- If it be proposed to have another issue of notes, and still to keep the gold, reserve at not more than  25  per cent., my own belief is that it will be too small. Indeed, it is too small now ; and, in proportion to the extra number of notes issued, the reserve will be still further proportionately inadequate. 1 trust that no attempt will be made to cut it down to that level. There will always be a temptation still further to reduce the gold reserve available for the redemption of the notes on presentation. It must be remembered that the private banks will hold a very large proportion of notes which have not been issued to the public, and there is always the possibility - I do not say the probability - which should be guarded against and provided for, of a number of notes being suddenly presented oyer the counter for payment in gold. I do not want to see that kind of thing happen in the Commonwealth. It is a weakness in our financial system which ought to be guarded against; in any case, it is. a very bad system of finance to alter the basis of the currency from gold to mere I.O.U's. A country or a Government that conducts its business on I.O.U's. is not upon a sound financial basis. I do not think that private individuals could perpetually conduct their business on that system. If they could for a time, they would find, sooner or later, that something in the nature of a substantial redemption might be demanded, and if they were not in a position to meet their obligations, they would inevitably be overtaken by financial disaster. </para>

Commercially, most of the business of Sydney is done by the exchange of goods for goods- by the exchange of our wool and other local products for what we import. But presently we may have gold demanded, if we go on with legislation such as is proposed, and such as we have been enacting for some time past.

It will be recollected, perhaps, that I questioned the Minister of Home Affairs on the subject the other day.  His  first reply was really a mass of words to which no intelligible meaning could be attached. Whether it was his fault, or that of those who reported his statement, I am not prepared to say, but I must confess that when I heard him giving the answer I tried to analyze it and find out what it meant, but I could make neither head nor tail of it. On the following day I asked a further question with the view of getting the information I wanted. But again the Minister evaded the point of my question, giving me a reply about something which did not form part of theinquirs. I did not desire to pursue the matter further then, because it seemed to me rather hopeless, and I thought I had better wait tor this occasion to say a few words.

                        <para>- Yes ; that, among many other commodities most largely used by the wage-earning classes. The Labour party voted for the sugar duty, and thus increased the price of sugar to the workingman's household. If any attempt is made to further increase the burdens which press so heavily now on the backs of the workers, I, for one, will strenuously oppose it, as I have done in the past. My principles to-day are those with which I entered political life, one of them being freedom of trade, or as near to that as can be got. If members of the Labour party would help me, I should be delighted to have their assistance. Unfortunately, when the Tariff was last under consideration, we had the peculiar spectacle of the Free Trade members of the Labour party voting for the highest duties on food, clothing, and other necessaries. We found them helping, by imposing restrictions on trade, to build up the monopolies for whose existence they are now responsible, although they denounce them from the public platform. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether before millions are spent on the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta careful inquiry will be made as to whether the mono-rail system could be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that the gauge to be adopted is the standard one of 4 ft. 8i in., and am glad to know that the negotiations for the establishment of a uniform gauge on the lines connecting the capital cities of the mainland are proceeding. The adoption of a uniform gauge is a reform which should be made at the earliest moment, and if the Government succeeds in overcoming the difficulties which now stand in the way of its accomplishment, great benefits will accrue to all the States. I should like some information as to what steps, if any, have been taken in the way of administration to develop the immense area we have taken over in the Northern Territory? Has there been any movement .to have railways surveyed or preparations made for an influx of desirable settlers ? Has if-been determined what type of settlers are to be encouraged to settle in this tropical portion of Australia? I take it that the White Australia policy is the settled policy of Australia, irrespective of party. I do not think that any of us desire to encourage the immigration of alien races, especially those of another colour or of an inferior type. If we are to people the Northern Territory effectively, it will be necessary to secure immigrants of a very virile type. It will take considerable time to get acclimatized; and we desire to see future generations robust enough to insure that the Territory will remain in our undisturbed possession for all time. I <inline font-style="italic">suggest</inline> that if we cannot get British stock in sufficient numbers, some efforts might be made to induce immigration from the Scandinavian races. It would not be wise, I think, to import people from southern Europe. In the first place, their physical Stamina is not up to the necessary standard to insure a robust race in the future, and there are political - national and international - reasons why such immigrants might be undesirable. The Scandinavian people are very virile, thoroughly law abiding, and loyal to the country of their adoption when they become naturalized citizens ; and if we secured immigrants of this type we should insure the White Australia policy coupled with the advantage of the best class of settler. I offer that as a suggestion to the Prime Minister, who may, however, already have given the matter his serious attention. The Government have been very ill-advised, I think, in withdrawing the Vancouver mail service subsidy. A paragraph in the Governor-General's Speech states that the Government have under consideration the establishment of reciprocal trade with New Zealand and Canada; and I point out that we had an opportunity by means of the subsidy to establish such trade, certainly with Canada. I looked forward to the opening up and development of a very large trade with Canada by means of the direct Vancouver route, and I am sorry to see that the small subsidy has been withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>- And it was not renewed, as I think it ought to have been. I agree with the honorable member for Grey that the Government have committed a grave error of judgment in not renewing, and even increasing, the subsidy. The time has arrived when such a large volume of trade, as well as passenger traffic, could be opened up that, if we could secure proper cool storage space on board large vessels as could be done under an arrangement for a subsidy, the result would be mutually profitable to both Dominions. Then I think that larger steamers and an accelerated service ought to be provided, for there is no reason that I can see why the trip to Vancouver should not be completed in about eighteen days. In view of the large, number of tourists who pass through Canada and America, a line of steamers between Vancouver and Sydney, calling at Suva, Honolulu, and Fiji, as was the case in the recent service, would attract a large number of temporary visitors, who might ultimately become permanent residents in Australia. Unfortunately, through the non-renewal -of the subsidy, a project of that kind has been hung up, and New Zealand, taking advantage of our want of foresight, has, by means of a direct service diverted the stream of traffic to her own shores. It is not too late to rectify the error, and negotiations might be opened up with immense advantage to our commercial life, and generally to the community of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear it. In this connexion, more vigilance is required in the matter of territorial expansion in the Pacific. I do not know what was done in this respect by the representatives of the Commonwealth at the recent Imperial Conference ; but, from the newspaper reports of the proceedings, it does not appear that the question was brought prominently forward. I conceive it to be one of the biggest questions that the Commonwealth - the Empire at large, and particularly Great Britain - will have to face in the immediate future. I have repeatedly called attention in this House to the continuous foreign territorial expansion in the Pacific. I believe that some representations have been made from time to time to the British Government, but the question has not been presented to them as it ought to have been. Owing to our remote geographical position, we are practically isolated from the centres of the world's commercial activity; but the opening of the Panama Canal a very short time hence will change the whole complexion of the Pacific question. Its practically deserted waters will then become one of the world's busiest commercial highways. Other countries, particularly Britain's commercial rivals, have fully realized this, and are providing for it by securing all the territory they can in the Pacific, by establishing trade, and by acquiring there ports that may, and probably will, be used eventually for naval bases. I realize the gravity of this question as affecting the future of Australia, because, with the opening of the Panama Canal, we shall no longer occupy our present isolated position, but will become the centre of a tremendous volume of commercial activity. A great portion of the trade that now goes round the Cape or through the Suez Canal will be diverted by the Panama Canal route to the Pacific. I hope the Government will take an interest in this question, and that if representations have not already been made to the British Government as to the importance of watching developments in the Pacific, and trying, as far as possible, to keep the Union Jack floating over the Pacific, no time will be lost in impressing upon the Home authorities the gravity of the position from the point of view of the whole Empire. The honorable member for Grey referred to the fact that in Fiji, for instance, the natives are gradually being wiped out. I noticed while there a few weeks since . that the native Fijian, who is a very fine type of man, tall, well-built, robust, and possessing many desirable attributes, is gradually being elbowed out of his place by a very inferior race of people, who will undoubtedly become a very serious menace to our White Australia policy. If that process of development is going on, as I have reason to believe it is, in other parts of the Pacific, the danger must be very considerably accentuated. </para>

                        <para>- We are largely responsible for the present situation; because, instead of encouraging British and Australian settlement in these islands by admitting into Australia free of duty the produce that white settlers must export to tide them over the time between the planting of their cocoanut trees and their reaching maturity, and thus becoming a marketable commodity, we are placing obstacles in the way of white settlement there. We are placing in the way of that settlement obstacles that other nations are not setting up ; and to that extent we are more responsible than are the British Government for the non-development of these islands by Britishers and Australians, and for the gradual passing of some of them into the control of foreign Powers. I come now to the question of the referenda vote in April last, and its association with the question of trusts, monopolies, and combines. It is very amusing to read paragraph  26,  which says, " My Advisers regret the result of the referenda vote in April last." I have no doubt they do, but a great many of their brethren in the same party, representing State constituencies, do not share the grief which so oppresses the souls of Labour- Socialist members here. "The ever-increasing exactions of the trusts make an extension of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth imperative." I should like to know in what respect the constitutional powers of the State are deficient in dealing with trusts, combines, and monopolies that grow up within the State boundaries and come under State jurisdiction. Is there a provision in any State Constitution to prevent the State Parliaments themselves dealing with them in any way they like? I ask the members of the Government who are responsible for this Speech to show in what respect the States are powerless to deal with the trusts. The States have the fullest powers to deal with them; they are sovereign States with power to make laws for the welfare of the people within their boundaries. The trusts have not all become Commonwealth concerns. </para>

                        <para>- The State of Queensland, or the State of New South Wales, could effectively deal with it. Any State in which the operations of the Combine exist can prevent it operating within its borders. The States could even go to the extent of nationalizing these concerns, so much power have they got. It is therefore ridiculous nonsense to pretend that it was necessary to ask at the recent referenda for those powers to be conferred upon the Commonwealth because the States had not sufficient power to control them. </para>

                        <para>- In the opinion of some of the best legal experts, it can. I will tell the honorable member the reason why the Commonwealth law is not so effective as it might be. When what was popularly known as the Anti-Trust Bill was before the House, member after member of the Labour party, both leaders and rank and file, rose on that side of the House, and pleaded for certain monopolies, combines, and trusts to be exempted from the operations of the Act. Is it any wonder when they come to administer the Act themselves that they find themselves unable to do what they profess to want to do? They themselves are responsible for the failure to do all that was hoped of it by its authors. The Government of the day were powerless to make the Act what they wanted it to be, because several members of the present Government, who were then their own supporters, and by whose favour alone they were kept in office, rose and defended all these combines, including the Sugar Trust, the Newcastle Coal Vend, the Shipping Combine, and the Tobacco Monopoly. They said they wanted them, and did not wish them to be interfered with, because they were good things for the workers. They do not tell that tale now, but carefully suppress all these facts from public knowledge. They go about the country proclaiming themselves the opponents of the trusts, and charging us on this side of the House with being the supporters of the trust. So far as I know, there is no one on this side of the House that believes in injurious trusts, combines, and monopolies. I have fought, and will fight against them, I hope, so long as I remain in public life. I have never heard any one who sits on this side of the House champion any injurious monopoly. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. That is not necessary. It would only be to create the worst and most complete monopoly of all. All that is required is to make such laws as will prevent the combines from becoming injurious to the community's welfare. The States already have the fullest powers to do this, and it is unnecessary for the Commonwealth to step in and ask that the States should be deprived of their powers. </para>

                        <para>- But the Attorney-General, one of the honorable member's leaders, says that these trusts and combines represent a triumph for sensible co-operation over senseless competition, and, according to his argument, should on that account be left alone. Where is the consistency of these conflicting statements of honorable members opposite? If these sentiments were littered by an honorable member on this side they would be indignantly repudiated by honorable members opposite, but because they were uttered by their own Attorney-General, we find them absolutely dumb. We have heard from time to time a great deal on the subject of trusts of an injurious character, such, for instance, as the Shipping Combine.  Yet there were members of the Labour party here and in- another place who stood up to defend the Shipping Combine. They contended that it was a good thing for the workers, and that they had themselves urged that it should be formed. They have admittedly been responsible to some extent for this very Shipping Combine which honorable members of the same party in this House have so loudly denounced. Let honorable members read the utterances of some labour senators upon combines. One of these gentlemen, in speaking of the Coal Vend, said -  </para>

But the most marvellous feature about the whole of this peculiar business is that the Newcastle Coal Vend, which is to be clubbed, and which,  at the present time, is the subject of some legal proceedings, was not a creation of monopolists themselves, but was brought into existence by the Miners' Federation - that is, if we are to believe the newspaper reports. </para><interjection>

                        after referring to the object of the conference, said " the committee was there at the request of the miners working at the various collieries in the district. The men desired that the proprietors should be approached upon the subjects of an advance in the price of coal trade prices, and an increase in the hewing rate. . . . This (the foreign, interState, and home trade) was a large market which the proprietors could, to some extent, control, in the way of preventing undue competition. By proper combination, the same preventive measures might also be applied to some extent to the operations of foreign trade."

                        <para>- They conveniently omitted to point that out. But they knew that the largest consumers of domestic coal are the wage-earners themselves, who cannot afford fancy electric-lighting contrivances to generate heat. They have to buy Newcastle coal - which is generally the class of coal that they prefer - and this meant increasing the price of coal to them. Hence the enhanced price had to come largely out of the pockets of the workers. To that extent the workers would be injured by this conspiracy of employers and employed to put up the price of coal. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the price of coal, as a result of that Conference, was considerably increased to the public, and the output limited to the disadvantage of employes and the public. The honorable member's remarks might more appropriately be addressed to the Attorney-General and other members of the Government, who are now denouncing this very institution - the Coal Vend - as something which ought to be wiped out of existence, or, to use their own picturesque language, to be clubbed by means of Commonwealth legislation. I also desire to refer to the practice inaugurated by members of the present Government of subscribing to strike funds. That is, I think, a very serious innovation on Ministerial procedure. We have to remember that strikes are being made illegal. We have legislation which was specially devised for the purpose of putting down strikes and substituting a saner method for what honorable members on the other side have described as the barbaric method of the strike. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister's view of what is right is, I am afraid, distorted by his political predilections. These should be set aside when he has the responsibility of Ministerial office on his shoulders, and is charged by his oath to administer the law fairly and impartially. A Minister who contributes to a strike fund in this way gives encouragement to law-breaking, when he ought to set an example of law-observance, and when it may become his duty to put the law in motion, to punish the law-breaker. If a Minister becomes a law-breaker, as he does by that act, he must put the law in motion against himself, because he, too, has supplied the means to enable the law to be defied. I hope, however, that this thing will not be continued. If it is continued, of course, Ministers will have to reconcile their act with their oath of office. </para>

                        <para>- Wrong and injustice often have to be swallowed by those temporarily in the minority, but trie power to injure does not always justify the infliction of injury. I do not think that it can be charged to any previous Government, either in the Commonwealth or in a State, that a contribution of that kind has ever been made. I regret very much, for the honour and credit of our parliamentary institutions, that it has happened, or is reported to have happened. I have not any official knowledge that it has been done, but I have not seen the report contradicted, and I take it, from the Minister's interjection, that the report is correct, in substance, if not in detail. </para>

                        <para>- We have legislated with a view to practically making strikes illegal by substituting another method for settling industrial' disputes. Quite irrespective of the merits of the dispute, the principle of the thing is bad. A Minister of the Crown is in a very different position to an ordinary person, and cannot be too careful in avoiding even the appearance of identifying himself with either party to an industrial dispute. I hope that such conduct will not be persevered in. While I have a great deal of sympathy with the legitimate aspirations of those who are engaged as wage-earners for the improvement of their condition, I certainly do not approve of the methods adopted by some of those who call themselves the Labour party. I do not subscribe, for example, to that doctrine of class selfishness, that doctrine of class consciousness, which is eternally drummed into the ears and the minds of the workers by the official organs of the party, and by individual members of the party on various platforms. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear that statement, because an appeal to class prejudice is a very bad thing for a community to start with. I believe that it will be very much better, to appeal to reason and justice. These are two guiding principles, which I hold to be the basic foundation of the enduring prosperity of a country. Any community which sets aside these ideals and bases its claims for support on appeals to class prejudice, class hatred, and class interest is, in my opinion, doomed sooner or later to fail. It is not wise, in the interests of the community, that any party should be in power which can only make an appeal on those lines to the general public. And in that connexion. I propose to read a quotation from a very eminent authority on the side of the labour organizations, because of the sound sentiments therein contained, and the exact coincidence of my views with those of the writer. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> H. Morrissey, formerly the head of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, who was cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> Roosevelt in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Outlook</inline> of 5th August last.

A criminal act committed by a misguided or over-zealous individual supposedly in the interests of labour is as reprehensible as a similar act would be if committed by an avowed opponent of labour. Labour cannot claim greater liberty under the law than any other group of our citizenship, nor can it be expected to accept less. We might consider with propriety whether we are encouraging the members of these organizations to do the best that is within them in the service they give to their employers, and thus indirectly to the public. </para>

Organized labour cannot advance the interests of the workers by holding itself aloof from the other groups, which go to make up society. It should be able and prepared to state its principles and. defend them anywhere. It cannot, in my judgment, ultimately succeed by preaching: the doctrine of hatred, or encouraging labour to withhold its recognition of the great public questions, because, perchance, labour would be associated with some of its enemies past or present. </para>

                    <para>Bad as selfishness is in the individual, it is infinitely worse when set up as the battle-cry of some one portion of the community shut in by an industrial boundary. It is a crime, and worse than a crime, a blunder; for if the people as a whole come to understand that organized labour's only interest in politics is to win special privilege for itself, they will " lay for it " with a club, and. its last state will be worse than its first. By uniting with saloons and the tough element - as in San Francisco- it may have its brief hour of local triumph, but in the long run it will be heavily the loser. </para>
                </quote><para>There is wisdom in every line I have read. These passages are in accordance with the position which I have always taken in regard to labour and economics. In setting class against class, you do infinite harm to the community, and especial harm to those whose interests are thought to be served. I have always preached the doctrine of equal opportunity, justice, and liberty for all, and hold to it as strongly to-day as in the beginning. But there can be no equality of opportunity if preference is given to unionists, because the non-unionists have not the same chance. To coerce by starvation into joining unions men who prefer to remain outside such organizations is, besides being a cruel form of tyranny, a flat negation of the principle of equal rights, equal liberty, equal justice, and equal opportunity. I am sorry that the principle of the spoils to the victors is to be introduced in connexion with the appointments in our Public Service, which is to be the case if we are to believe the reports in this morning's newspapers of the interview between representatives of the- Trades Hall and the Prime Minister. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- There is coercion when it is made a condition of entrance to a union that the applicant shall vote for the selected candidate of the party. The attempt is now made to fetter and enslave men financially, industrially, and politically; and those engaged in such practices are simply weaving the rope which must ultimately hang themselves. We, in Australia especially, have been reared in an atmosphere of freedom. We come from a race which has fought, and suffered, and bled for freedom in generations gone by ; the freedom that we are now enjoying is a heritage. Although some unthinking young persons may be prepared to surrender privileges gained for them by others, the irk.someness of union restrictions will be come so great as to force them to rebel, and_inside the organization the elements of disruption will ultimately grow so strong as to burst the fabric asunder. The Governor-General's Speech is a significant commentary on the declaration made by the Ministry responsible for the referenda proposals, that if those proposals were not indorsed it would be impossible to legislate for any of the principles of their platform. This is actually one of the longest programmes ever put forward in a Governor-General's Speech, and there are embodied in it proposals which are part of the Labour policy just as if no referenda had taken place, and no declaration, such as I have indicated, made. Ministers have evidently forgotten the statements they made prior to 26th April. We find, as we said at the time, that their declarations were just humbug. We are told in paragraph 29 that the purchase of a site, and the erection of a suitable building, in London for the High Commissioner's office, to provide accommodation also for the State representatives, is an urgent necessity, and that proposals to that end will be submitted at an early date. This is a step in the right direction, because the High Commissioner's office is now most inconveniently situated, so far as the public are concerned. Even those who have occasion to go very frequently into the neighbourhood are altogether unaware of the fact that the office is there. When I inquired for it, I was advised to take a motor 'bus along Victoriastreet, and ask the conductor to put me down at the right place. When I asked him for the office of the High Commissioner for Australia, he said, " Do you mean Canada?" I replied, " No; I mean Australia - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's office." The conductor said, " I never heard of the gentleman, nor of his office." Ultimately, I was put down, at the Army and Navy Stores, two or three hundred yards away, and was told that I would probably get the information I required in there. I merely give this incident to illustrate the inconvenient situation of the office, which is a reason for finding a more suitable site. </para>

                        <para>- There is a brass plate, and also a number of other brass plates; but those who have visited London will agree with me as to the inconvenience of the situation of the office.We visited a site suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, and I think there was a general consensus of opinion that it was one of the best for the purpose. It- is that on which the Victorian Agent-General's office is crected, and I hope that steps will be taken to acquire that site, or another equally eligible, so that Australia may be represented in a proper manner at a place easy of access, and likely to attract public attention. Paragraph  31  of the Governor-General's Speech refers to the introduction of penny postage, and says that that reform completed the true federation of the postal services of the Commonwealth, and, whilst involving a loss of revenue, provided greater compensating advantages. I desire to know what was the cause of the delay in regard to the proclamation concerning [jenny postage. </para>

                        <para>- And possibly I should not, had it not been that my State was suffering an injustice as compared with Victoria. The injustice was that whereas the people of New South Wales were satisfied to submit to the twopenny rate under the old financial system, while the excess which they paid over the people of Victoria went into the New South Wales Treasury ; but under the new system not one penny of that excess went to the State. During the months of delay that elapsed between the passing of the Act and the issue of the proclamation bringing it into operation, the twopenny rate of postage continued to prevail in New South Wales, and the people of that State thus contributed to the Treasury of the Commonwealth about  . £13,000  per month which they had no right to be called upon to contribute. Realizing this injustice, I believe the Treasurer of New South Wales made some representations to the Commonwealth, but that no refund has yet been made. I hope that this money, forced unjustly from the people of New South Wales, will be refunded to the State Treasury, but evenhanded justice is not a strong point with the Fisher Government. There are several other matters to which I propose to refer when the Budget is under consideration. One of these, that of the muddle in the Postmaster-General's Department, I should be justified in drawing attention to at this stage, but as the hour is somewhat late, I shall reserve to myself the right to deal with it on a future occasion. Before I close I feel bound to say that we ought to do something to express our appreciation of the generous and unbounded hospitality extended to the delegates to the Imperial Conference and to the Coronation celebrations by the King and Queen, the Government, the members' of the British Parliament, and the people of the United Kingdom. They left nothing undone that would minister to the enjoyment and comfort of the delegation or to impress upon their minds the good feeling that prevailed in British political, commercial, and social circles regarding the people of Australia. The most kindly sentiments were expressed, and I feel sure that a great deal of good will result from the visit. 1 hope that the Government will submit some motion expressing appreciation of all that was done, in order to make the visit of the Australian delegates successful. </para>
