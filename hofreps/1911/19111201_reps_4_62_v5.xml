                    <para class="block">The measure affords an opportunity to the employes of the public to appeal to the Arbitration Court for the settlement of differences and the adjustment of anomalies Its provisions are , in many respects, similar to those of the principal Act. Obviously, it would be impossible for the Court to deal with individual cases, but the members of any class or grade, numbering  100,  may register as an organization, and appeal to the Court, and where in any class or grade within the Commonwealth there are fewer than  100  employes, three-fifths of the total number may form themselves into an association and register. The powers of the Court are set out in clause 6, which is virtually a repetition of similar provisions in the principal Act. Under clause 3, employes in any division, class, grade, or branch of the Public Service of the Commonwealth,  Or  in any calling, service, handicraft, occupation, or avocation in it, are to be deemed employe&#39;s in an industry within the meaning of the Act  1 904-11.  An organization of employes may submit to the Court by plaint any claim relating to the salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service or employment of its members, and the Court shall thereupon have cognisance of the claim as if it were an industrial dispute within the meaning of the principal Act. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Court is empowered to make a common rule, which can be extended to persons outside, the organization represented before it. The Public Service Commissioner and the Minister of any Department affected by a claim may be represented, either jointly or separately, in its hearing and determination, but neither party to a case can be represented by counsel or solicitor. The employer is the people of the country, of whom the Public Service Commissioner is the agent. He will represent the employer&#39;s case, the organization will represent the employes&#39; case, and an impartial  chairman,  hearing what the two parties have to say, will make such award as he may think just. Clause 7 enables the Court to refer any claim or matter arising out of a claim to a Judge of a State Court, a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate, or other person authorized by the Governor-General in that behalf, to whom it may delegate. such of its powers as it deems desirable. In such an event, for example, as a dispute arising in connexion with the construction of the transcontinental railway, the employes affected could not come to the Court, nor the Court go to them, and in all cases of the kind the matter will be referred in the manner provided for, but there would be an appeal to the Court from &#34;the decision of the person to whom the hearing of the case was delegated. Under no circumstances, however, will there be an appeal from the decision of the Court itself. Iri clause 8 we have the necessary provision that- </para>

                    <para class="block">That will place the employer of the public servants of the Commonwealth, or his agent, in exactly the same position as is an employer in private enterprise. In other words, they must obey the orders of the Court. The Court, under clause  9,  may exercise any of its powers under the Act of its own volition in certain circumstances, or on the application of a claimant organization, or of a Minister of State, or the Public Service Commissioner. That provision is in keeping with the terms of the principal Act. Under clause  10,  the Court in making an award will not be restricted to the matters set forth in the plaint. Power is given to it to make any award or  order that it thinks necessary in the interests of the public or of the Public Service, This is a very proper provision to make, since it frequently happens that men, while knowing that they are dissatisfied, do not always recognise the precise cause for their dissatisfaction or the precise remedy that is called for. It is a very trite aphorism that the onlooker sees more of the game than do the players, and the power proposed to be conferred upon the Court under this clause has already been granted to it in dealing with private employers and employes. Clause 11 declares that no costs shall be allowed on either side; and clause 12 provides that neither party is to be represented by counsel or solicitor. I come now to clause 13, which repeats the amending section introduced in the principal Act by the Bill passed earlier in the session, providing, really, that the decision of the Court shall be final. This clause, however, will have a wider scope than has that in the amending Bill passed earlier in the session, to which I have just referred, inasmuch as our powers are, in regard to the public servants of the Commonwealth, plenary. We are subject in this regard only to those restrictions in the Constitution which deal with the rights of public servants. Those rights cannot be taken from them by this or any other measure; but, subject to that condition, this Parliament can do whatever it elects to do in respect of the Commonwealth Public Service, and can, therefore, delegate to the Court the same power. Under the Constitution, officers transferred from the States , to the Commonwealth have certain rights, and those rights cannot be taken from them by the Court. Subject to the Constitution generally, however, the decision of the Court is to be final. </para>

                            <para>- There cannot, and need not, be any appeal on a matter clearly within the jurisdiction of the Court. If we are to have finality, we might as well have it here as well as anywhere else. I come now to a matter in connexion with which considerable difficulty naturally arises out of the circumstances of the case. Clause 14 provides that - (1.) Every award made under this Act shall be expressed not to come into operation until a future date, not earlier than after the expiration of thirty days after the award has been laid before both Houses of the Parliament. (2.) When an award has been made under this Act, the  President  of the Court shall forthwith send to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General a certified copy of the award. (3.) The Prime Minister shall, within fourteen days after its receipt, if the Parliament is then sitting, or if not then within fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament, cause the award to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">Unless the scope of the Court&#39;s authority in regard to matters brought before it by public servants was to be limited to the powers that could be exercised by the Public Service Commissioner under the Public Service Act, it is obvious that, if the Court thought proper to make such awards as were or might not be limited by the scope of the Act, those awards should come before Parliament. We have, therefore, provided, under clauses 14 and 15, for an award to be made by the Court which may, in effect, be or amount to, when adopted, an amendment of existing legislation. Whatever Statutes now govern the relation between the Commonwealth and its public servants necessarily impose upon the Public Service Commissioner certain restrictions. Whether he is desirous or not of going outside those restrictions he cannot do so. There is only one authority at present that is able to do so, and that is Parliament itself. For example, in the third schedule of the Public Service Act it is prescribed that in the clerical division fifth class officers shall begin at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40, &#163;50.</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60</inline> a year, and that their salaries shall increase until they receive, in the sixth subdivision,&#163;160 per annum. If the Public Service Commissioner desired to pay the men in that subdivision&#163;180 per annum he could not do so, although he might make such an increase in the case of public servants whose maximum salary was set down, not in the Act. but under some regulation under the Act. It is, therefore, perfectly clear, and, of course, there are many other cases of the kind, that unless the functions of the Court are to be so severely confined as to practically make it a mere censor of regulations under the Act, it must have power to make such awards as it thinks fits, regardless of whether or not those awards come within an Act of Parliament. And here we come to the most important point. It would obviously be most undesirable that any </para>
                    <para class="block">Court, tribunal, or person outside the Parliament should be permitted to fix, without supervision or regulation of any sort whatever, any rates or conditions of employment that it thought fit for public servants of the Commonwealth, irrespective of the ability of the Treasurer to pay therm or the country to find the money. It is perfectly true, and we must not forget it, however, that a private employer is bound to observe the awards of the Court, and must find the money necessary to enable him to do so. Once the Court has said that he must pay a certain wage he is bound to pay it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins the other day made an award in the seamen&#39;s case, which I have been told will involve an extra payment in wages amounting to <inline font-style="italic">00,000</inline> a year. If this Parliament had suddenly to face the possibility of an additional expenditure of ^100,000 a year such a contingency would exercise our minds very considerably, and we should have to think very carefully before we assented to such a proposition. For the employers of the seamen, however, there is no escape - they must pay the extra money. I wish, however, to point out a fundamental distinction between the community and the individual as an employer. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins made an award in the Broken Hill case he prescribed a rate of wage which was considered by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, I think, to be such as could not be paid, having regard to the price which their ore was then fetching, and the company, therefore, declined to work the mine, and did not work it for some time. Clearly any employer has that option. If he carries on his enterprise he must pay the rates fixed by the Court, but he need not carry it on. The Commonwealth Public Service, however, is in a different position. It must go on, no matter what wage is prescribed. Take, for instance, the Postal Department. It is obvious that if for any reason the wages of public servants in that Department were trebled by order of the Court, the people of the Commonwealth would not listen to any suggestion that, because of that increase of wages, or for any other reason, the Postal Department must be shut down. It could not be shut down. We have, therefore, provided that since Parliament is the representative of the people, and upon us is the responsibility of the whole business, any award that is in conflict with any Statute or regulation under a Statute must, before it can take effect, be laid on the table of each House in the Parliament, and that if either House, by resolution, takes exception to it, it shall then become null and void. While giving an unlimited freedom to the Court to redress any grievance, we thus retain in the hands of the Parliament the right that belongs to the community of saying whether or not they are prepared to accept the conditions of service which the Court thinks proper to impose. While this is a check in one direction, it also imposes a very necessary check in another. The public servants will have the assurance that any proposed reduction in their salaries by the Court at any time, or any proposal to make their conditions worse, will come before Parliament, which may, if it thinks fit, object to such proposals - whether the proposals be for a reduction or an increase Parliament will have the right to veto. </para>
                    <para>This Bill seems to me to give the Public Service a tribunal from which they, by no conceivable means, can suffer any detriment to which Parliament itself does not assent. Any . dispute or difference will be heard, sifted, and adjudicated on by an impartial tribunal, and any award made will be laid, in substance and in detail, before honorable members, who will have an opportunity to express their opinion upon it, and, if thought proper, vote against it. &#39; It is provided in clause 16 that the office of the Industrial Registrar, the duties of which have been most satisfactorily performed by the present occupant ever since the inception of the Court, shall be taken out of the control of the Public Service Commissioner. It would be obviously an anomaly to allow the Public Service Commissioner to regulate the salary of a person who will, at the same time, be in a quasi judicial position in regard to the officers under the Public Service Commissioner. It is, therefore, proposed to make the Industrial Registrar an independent officer subject only to Parliament.  His  salary, which will be appropriated, commences at &#163;600, and increases by yearly increments of ,&#163;50 to .&#163;850. This Bill will affect, at present, some 35,000 persons, and in the future, no doubt, a considerably larger number. The number of permanent hands in the Public Service is slightly over 16,000, and the temporary hands are about 19,000; while the salaries paid to the permanent hands aggregate &#163;2,300,000, and those to the temporary hands about ,&#163;400,000. The total in 1910 was ,&#163;2,516,000. Since this Government came into office the Commonwealth permanent public servants have received increments totalling some &#163;200,000 per annum, and the temporary officers about &#163;50,000. This means that, as a result of the action of the Fisher Government, the public servants now receive &#163;250,000 per annum more than previously. The Court has, in this Bill, been rid of all those restrictions that have hampered it in its general application ; and the public servants will have a tribunal from which they will receive expeditious and economical treatment, and the assurance of a careful and independent hearing, and they will know that whatever award is made will be subject to approval by Parliament. There will be absolutely the best possible guarantee that any employes, either public or private, could, or ought to, desire. Any matters of detail to which I have not referred I shall deal with in Committee, and simply content myself now with moving that the Bill be read a second time. </para>

                        <para>.- I should have liked a little more time to look at the Bill. I recognise, however, that the Government are desirous of getting on quickly with the business, and, as some professional engagement may prevent my being here next Wednesday, I should like to say at once how the measure strikes me. I do not know why the Bill has been introduced except to get over some difficulty in connexion with the claims of transferred officers. I cannot understand why, as a matter of policy, we should supersede the Public Service Act, and, to some extent, upset our power of fixing salaries by Act of Parliament. I remember that there were deputations to the Postmaster-General and other Ministers in connexion with what are called the accrued rights of some of the transferred officers. Eventually a way out of the difficulty was suggested by one Minister, who thought that the matter might be referred to the Arbitration Court. Apparently, therefore, the genesis of this Bill is the difficulty in connexion with some of the transferred officers as to their accrued rights under section 84 of the Constitution. I may, of course, be wrong in this supposition ; but one Postmaster-General - the present Minister of External Affairs, I think-was reported in the press to have made the suggestion I have indicated. Is this Bill the result of that promise? If so, it seems to me very unwise to upset all our agreements, and the parliamentary control over the public servants, in order to surmount a difficulty which we have not attempted to face by a special Act. There are some transferred officers who consider that, under section 84 of the Constitution, they have been deprived of certain annual increments they were entitled to under the Acts of the States. They also complain in regard to certain allowances for doing Savings Bank business, and in regard to their furlough having been cut down. There are these and some other rights of which, according to their contention, they have been deprived. I am not now, of course, dealing with the merits of their contention. Personally, I think that the Public Service Commissioner did what he was perfectly entitled to do under the Public Service Act. I do not say that the transferred officers have been fairly treated by Parliament - that is another matter. AVe have invested the Public Service Commissioner with certain powers and responsibilities either directly or .by necessary implication in the terms of the Act j and this, at all events, has been his legal justification for not classifying all the officers in a special way under the Act,  50  as to give them the full rights in all cases that they enjoyed under the Acts of the States. But whatever may have been the restraint which prevented the Public Service Commissioner, perhaps, from- recognising the full claims of these officers, there is no doubt that we could have amended the Public Service Act so as to have granted what was fair and reasonable in the demands of those officers. If the officers have any very strong claim, it is in relation to the policy of the Government rather than in connexion with the administration of the Act by the Public Service Commissioner ; at any rate, that is how the matter strikes me. The officers ask, for instance, that their salaries shall be at a higher rate than is possible under the Public Service Act as it stands. It is said that some men who were receiving .&#163;250 under .the State Acts at the time of the transfer lose, perhaps, z&#163;5&#176; or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#62;&#38;&#176;</inline> by the gradation that is necessary under the Public Service Act; and what we ought to have done was to amend the Act. Six or seven years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, when Treasurer, informed us that the total amount involved in the claims of the transferred officers was about  ^44,000  a year. In the State of South Australia, which has been most exigent in the matter, because the salaries there were cut down to a greater extent than in any other of the States, the amount necessary to settle all the claims was only  ^4,000  a year, in addition to the expenditure under the Public Service Act. Time after .time, the claims of these transferred officers have been pressed on Ministers, and half-hearted and halting promises of redress have been made. &#39;Their claims have never really been settled by Parliament - never actually repudiated once for all, or any attempt made by Act of Parliament to recognise them. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to do so, but there have been very great reductions caused by the method of classification prescribed by the Act, the carrying out of which is incumbent on the Public Service Commissioner. If there are any merits in the claim of the transferred officers, it is for Parliament to recognise them by an amendment of the Act. We should be justified, as a matter of policy, in providing certain conditions as applicable to transferred officers in order to get over the difficulties of the transition period. As I have said, the total amount involved was, some years ago, estimated to be about  &#163;44,000.  My point is that this question has never really been tackled by any Government by means of an amendment of the Public Service Act. It seems to me that the Government now propose to get over the difficulties raised by the demands of these transferred officers by saying, &#34; We will refer the claims of the whole service to the Court of Arbitration.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I do not. These transferred officers claimed certain constitutional rights under section  84.  The High Court has said that section  84  does not extend to all their cases - that was decided in the cases of <inline font-style="italic">Bond</inline> against the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Cousins</inline> against the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth -</inline> but the officers say that on the merits, apart altogether from the law, they are entitled to have their claims recognised. The High Court said that with regard to some of them, the rights to salaries were preserved only until some competent legislature had dealt with the matter,, that they enjoyed those rights under the Civil Service Acts of the States, but that those Acts could have been amended by Parliament at any time, arid that, therefore, it was competent for this Legislature, which now deals with these officers, to do what the States could have done by amending the Act. Apart, however, from the question of law, the merits are for Parliament to deal with, and it seems to me a well-founded complaint on the part of the transferred officers that there has never been an attempt by Parliament to deal with their claims. What, however, was hinted at on one or two occasions was that possibly the whole matter might be referred to the Court of Arbitration, excluding, of course, the question of law as to whether or not their claims were preserved as accrued rights under section  84. </para>

                            <para>- There are only two States affected to any extent - South Australia and Queensland, and the merits of the claims of the officers in each State could be dealt with. It is not necessary to deal with each particular officer, because their case is that they have been affected as classes, and of course the individual has suffered to the extent to which, his salary has been reduced by classification. I would even now ask the Government whether it would not be wiser to bring in an amendment of the Public Service Act to deal with that matter, which seems to be the origin of the whole of this Bill, and let the House, on hearing the merits of the claims, once for all decide upon them by passing or rejecting that Bill, instead of having a Bill of this sort brought in. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing to refer to the Court now as a matter of law, the case of <inline font-style="italic">Cousins</inline> against .the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> having decided that the officers&#39; salaries could have been altered by Parliament. If that is so, of course, the wind is knocked out of the officers&#39; sails, so far as the law is concerned. I regret that, apparently to get over the difficulty raised by the importunity of these officers, there has been introduced an amendment of the Public Service Act to hand over to the Court of Arbitration the power to refix the wages or salaries of any class of officers. Is this expedient? I do not think there is a Government in the world that allows the salaries of its servants to be handed over to any lay tribunal. </para>

It covers about 32,000 employes, temporary or permanent, under the Public Service Act, and it also covers casual hands. &#34; Casuals &#34; are engaged from day to day or week to week. It is a much wider term here than it is in the Arbitration Act, and covers any sort of day labourer. Is it expedient, then, if there is discontent among, say, seventy out of a hundred casual hands employed on any work for the Commonwealth, that they should be empowered to precipitate a dispute and have a common rule made applicable to all the casual hands throughout Australia ? </para>

                            <para>- The Bill does not say so ; it is very wide in its terms, as will be seen by clauses 2 and 3. The ordinary labourers are men with whom I have the greatest sympathy. They are deserving of all consideration, because they have to give an immense amount of their reserve force very often for comparatively low wages ; but, unfortunately, they are a class who are still very great in numbers, and all those employed by the Commonwealth throughout Australia might become involved. When we have started our railways, they might number 15,000 or 20,000. Is it expedient that sixty or seventy men should have the power to involve all those persons in a dispute? As a matter of common sense, it is better that their right to wages should be determined by, say, the Minister of Home Affairs or the Minister of External Affairs, whichever has control of the construction of the- railways. Can the  President  of the Arbitration&#39; Court decide right off as to what ought to be a common rule applicable to all those men throughout Australia? It may be said that he will make a rule with modifications restricted to a part of them, but he does not do that now. So far as the common rule can be made, the tendency of the Court is to make it as wide . as the power. There was an attempt to make a common rule in the bootmakers&#39; case. The matter was referred to the High Court, and it was decided that it could not be done. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely dealing with the question of expediency. It seems to me that there are no constitutional bars in this case, because, as we are dealing with our own Public Service, we can do just as we like. Is it expedient to transfer from the direct control of Parliament, or of the Minister, or of the Public Service Commissioner, or of any administrative Department or branch of it which we choose to establish or have established, the power to decide what are fair rates of pay as regards employment, to the  President  of the Court of Arbitration, and not merely to him, but to any stipendiary magistrate of a State, who, under this Bill, will be able to make an award applicable to the employes of the Commonwealth Public Service? Under clause  7  the  President  of the Court, who, of course, cannot compass all these disputes throughout the length and breadth of Australia, can delegate to a Judge of a State Court, or a police stipendiary, or special magistrate, the power to make an investigation, or even a determination. Under the existing Arbitration Act a reference may be made, but there the State tribunal reports to the  President,  and the  President  makes the award. All that he can do is to ask for the guidance of a special tribunal - I think the Supreme Court of a State - as to what ought to be the local conditions applicable to particular employes in connexion with a dispute extending through the length and breadth of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It is undesirable- to do by methods of circumlocution what can be done directly. Why should we give a hundred employes out of some thousands the right to begin a dispute, and then authorize the police magistrate of a State, perhaps, to make an award in connexion with it ? That award&#39; having been made, it can.  be upset, and it is conditioned by the provision that it shall not come into force until laid before Parliament. Should it involve any modification, as it must in nine-tenths, of the cases, of the conditions of permanent employment it will not take effect until the Attorney-General has considered it, and directed the attention of Parliament to it. </para>

                            <para>- There is a great difference between one tribunal composed of several Judges and a score cf tribunals each consisting of  One  person. Even in this matter the Bill is not consistent, because in regard to officers coming under the PublicService Act, the attention of Parliament must be drawn to the fact that the award&#34; creates an interference, whereas in regard to casual hands there is only the appeal re the  President  of the Arbitration Court. I do not know why we should adopt this method of settling disputes between those administering the Commonwealth Public Service and their officers. I have not much to say about the Bill in detail, but I point out that clause  15  provides that if Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of a-n award, that award shall not come into operation. If such a resolution were rescinded twelve months later, would the award then come into operation ? Does the passing of a resolution by Parliament merely suspend an award? </para>

Moreover, the safeguards provided in the Act of 1904-10 do not apply in connexion with disputes provided for in the Bill, because the Bill is not to be incorporated in that Act. </para>

                            <para>- It is for Parliament to give redress, and it is the duty of Ministers to inquire into alleged causes of discontent. The chief cause of discontent now existing is the claim advanced in connexion with accrued rights under the Constitution which the High Court has not recognised as falling under section 84, but to deal with it it is not necessary to upset our administration. While I would treat with the greatest respect all legitimate claims by the Public Service, I think that it would obtain fairer and more reasonable conditions from an amendment of the Public Service Act, or the discussion of a motion giving honorable members an opportunity to consider any case. That would be better than this revolutionary interference with the Act. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Government on the introduction of the Bill. We have been told that there are 20,000 permanent employs in the Public Service, and many temporary hands. The honorable member for Angas seems to think that Parliament should consider and deal with the grievances of all who are dissatisfied with the findings of the Public Service Commissioner, but I am of opinion that we were returned to devote the time which should be given to the consideration of public affairs to the discussion of details of Public Service administration. We have provided for arbitration for the settlement of disputes, and should have enough faith in our legislation to apply to disputes with our own servants the principles that we apply to disputes between private employers and employe&#39;s. If we are to accept the argument of the honorable member for Angas that we, as  a Parliament, should deal individually with our employes, I think that the same argument should logically be applied to the position of the private employer. If it is wise that the Parliament should deal directly with its employes, discuss their grievances with them, and endeavour to adjust them, then I think there is enough humanity in the private employer to induce us to say to him, &#39;&#34; The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act is a failure, and we ask you to deal directly with your own employes and  endeavour  to adjust their grievances.&#34; I do not hesitate to say, however, that the decisions given by the Federal Court have had a beneficial influence on the prosperity of the Commonwealth. Every award made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor has been respected. There has been no rebellion against awards of the Federal Court. W;e are all pleased that it is so, for it is not our desire that there should be any industrial upheaval. We are pleased to know that so far as the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act has worked smoothly, and since it has done so we should be prepared to place our public servants under the jurisdiction of the Court, believing that they will get justice from it. If a mistake should be made, then under this Bill the Parliament will stand between the Court and the Public Service. A direct safeguard is actually provided. If the Court in a period of depression directed a reduction of wages in respect of certain branches of the Public Service it would be for the Parliament to say whether or not such a reduction should be made. Why should we make our public servants a special class, and place them upon a pedestal far above all other taxpayers in the community? If it is good for the mechanic, the shearer, the station hand, the seaman, the boot operator, and, in short, all other organized labour to come within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Court it is only right that public servants, who are in steady work, and receiving regular salaries, should be prepared to go to the Court to maintain, if necessary, their rights. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I have not a word to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> the Public Service Commissioner ; no man in his position could be above reproach. It is a very easy matter to find fault with a man occupying such an office. He has to classify the Public Service, to grade offices, fix  salaries, and so forth, and at present there is no appeal from his decisions. Wherever we go we are met by public servants who wish to bring before us the grievances under which they consider they labour, and who seek our intervention with a view of obtaining redress. There is no appeal from the Public Service Commissioner except to members of Parliament. Under this Bill, however, a decision given by the Public Service Commissioner concerning any question of wages may be reviewed by the Court. Public servants, instead of having to interview individual members of Parliament - instead of having to suffer any less of manhood - will be able to lay their grievances before the Court, and to obtain justice from it. We must all admit that the Public Service Commissioner has made mistakes, and he has made them because he has not had direct evidence to guide him. He has not had before him the men concerned, and has not been able to examine them. He has to obtain statements from various  responsible  officers, and, although he does the best he can with the material at hand, he must, in some cases, make mistakes.  If,  however, a mistake is made by the Court, it will not lie due to lack of information. The Court will have power to take the evidence, to hear witnesses examined and cross-examined, and te inquire in detail into the work being performed by the various employe&#39;. Under this system, no injustice should be possible. This is one of the best measures that the Government have formulated this session. It is designed to prevent a great deal of discontent in the Public Service, and I am sure that if our public servants place their case before the Court they will loyally abide by its decisions, just as men following other occupations have done. </para>

                            <para>- I do; but if public servants complained to me after the Court had thoroughly considered their case, and had made an award, I should say to them, &#34; You are in the same position as are other  men in the community who have obtained an award of the Court. The Court has made an award in your case, and you must give it a fair trial.&#34; If there is anything wrong in an award, they will have the right to seek a variation of it. The honorable member for Angas has pointed out that the conditions of public servants are different from those of other sections of the community. I admit that they are, and that we, as a Parliament, should stand up to our responsibilities. I know that the fear on the part of many public servants is that, under this proposal, they may lose some of their privileges; but it is not the intention of this Government to take away any of their privileges. Recently, a strike of public servants was threatened in South Australia, and another in New South Wales; and we h ave a right to look ahead and to see that we cannot fairly be held responsible should a strike actually occur, The Postmaster- General presides over a Department employing thousands of men. and his time is taken up with a. thousand-and-one questions, so that he cannot be expected to make a minute inquiry into all the details of employment in his branch of the service. He has naturally to rely on the word of his responsible officers. The trouble is, however, that those officers might be prejudiced, and that when a body of men waited on the Minister he might, so to speak, &#34; get his back up,&#34; and say, &#34; I have made up my mind. I am guided by my responsible officers, and can do no more.&#34; The result might be a. strike of public servants. But if the Minister is guided by the evidence given before the Court and the award made by it, there can be less likelihood of mistakes than there is under existing circumstances. I believe we are all anxious to make the Public Service an ideal one - to pay the best possible wages, and give the best possible conditions. But, while that is so, we have to remember that the public outside have to maintain the revenue of the country, and that we have to see justice done to the community generally, as well as to our own employes. I know of no fairer method by which this can be secured than the proposal to empower the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to consider all these questions, and give an impartial judgment on the matters submitted to it. The Court should be able to say, for instance, what, for three or four years, should be the wages of a letter-carrier. In arriving at a determination it would consider the duties of a letter-carrier. It would take into consideration the fact that he had to attend at an early hour in the morning, assist in sorting letters, and then deliver them ; that he would have an hour or two off in the middle of the day, and then return to duty, and be employed for a certain number of hours. It would consider, further, whether he had to carry heavy loads, whether he had to be constantly climbing upstairs, or whether his duties required him to be out in all sorts of weather. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, even the weight of his bag would be taken into consideration. The Court would have regard to all these matters, and its decisions should have a steadying influence. A wage would be fixed in respect of the man who had to deliver letters on foot, and another in respect of the man who delivered letters on horseback. And so with the telegraph operators. Each case would be dealt with separately, and I believe that this system must lead to our obtaining a more satisfied service. It is no argument to say that this is the first attempt made by any Government to bring Commonwealth servants under the Court. From time to time we have made changes, because we believed that they were desired by the country, and would be for the benefit of the people. If the country believes in the principle of arbitration, then we should have no hesitation in bringing our own employes under the Act. </para>

While we want to provide for fair wages, and reasonable conditions and privileges for our public servants, we must not put them on a pedestal so high that they cannot be approached by those in other walks of life. The workers outside the Public Service have also to earn their wages, and in justice to them, as well as to the men in the service, we are anxious to secure a fair deal all round. I hail this measure with pleasure, because I believe it marks a step  &#39;111  the right direction. I know of men in the Public Service who are very anxious to have an opportunity to place their case before the Court, because at present they have not the right of appeal  and I believe the ultimate effect of this Bill will  be to bring about far more contentment in the Public Service than at present prevails. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the reason no doubt was that, although this Bill purports to be an extension of the principle of arbitration, he was not able to marshal any substantial arguments in support of it. There is no public demand, or any demand even within the service, for a Bill of this kind. I admit that in times past and, in fact, within recent years, there have been numerous complaints of grievances and inequalities; but most of these have been ventilated and made the subject of the evidence before the Postal Commission, and the bulk really touch legislation rather than the administration of the existing law. If this Bill be passed, the bulk of these grievances will remain unredressed or undealt with unless there is an amendment of the Public Service Act. It has been said that this is a Bill for the extension of the principal of arbitration. The honorable member for South Sydney has told us that the public approve of this principle as applied to disputes between private employers and employes, and that, therefore, it may fairly be applied to controversies between the Commonwealth Government and its employes. That argument, however, altogether ignores the fundamental principle of the Public Service Act, which is that the Public Service Commissioner shall be the arbitrator for the determination of the rights and privileges, as well as the duties, of the public servants. The Public Service Commissioner is appointed by law as an arbitrator to deal with and settle matters as between the Executive Government, on the one hand, and the departmental officers on the other. He is there also for the purpose of abolishing what was formerly denounced as political patronage; and thus he relieves Ministers of the Crown and members of the unpleasant responsibility of interfering or taking sides in Public Service disputes. As I say, the Public Service Commissioner is really an arbitrator. </para>

                            <para>- No; the Public Service Commissioner has been placed in the position of a free and independent arbitrator. It might as well be proposed to grant another appeal from the present Arbitration Court. There must be finality somewhere; we cannot have an endless series of appeals from an endless series of Courts. The Commonwealth Commissioner, practically, deals with appeals from the decisions of superior officers and the heads of Departments. If an officer does not receive justice from his immediate superior, he may appeal to the permanent head, and from die permanent head to the Commissioner, whose position is the head of a series of legal determinations and safeguards for the protection of the officers, as well as for the efficiency of the service. In the Public Service Act we have the principle of arbitration, and numerous sections show that the Commissioner at the head of  the Public Service organization, is, so to speak, a judge intrusted with the duty and responsibility of doing justice. He is the trusted officer of Parliament and of the Government - he would not remain there if he were not, It is not a fact that arbitration has been ignored in the Act, or that it is necessary to introduce a measure of this kind. The evidence given before the Postal Commission shows that the bulk of the grievances relates to the necessity for the alteration of the law as to classification, promotion, transfer, discipline, and so forth. </para>

                            <para>- If Parliament considers that the rate of pay for any particular class or grade is insufficient, we have the remedy in our own hands without creating a new tribunal. The hands of the Public Service Commissioner are tied only by the limits of the law ; and, if the law is unjust, it is the duty of Parliament to alter it. If the Ministry regard any laws ot regulations as unfair, it is their duty to submit proposals to Parliament -for their rectification rather than to shunt the complaints, as it were, into a side track with a dead-end, where nothing further can be done. I have said that there is no demand, within or without the service, for this legislation ; and I should like to refer to the petition presented to this House in October last, signed by over 5,000 public servants of the Commonwealth. In that petition they say that they have been informed of the contemplated alteration of the law providing for an appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and they protest against the proposed alteration. The signatures include those of representatives of the Public Service in every State, and the petition may be regarded as a representative expression of the views of the service. The petition contains the following : - </para>

                            <para>- It has already been pointed out that, if the officers go to the Court, and are not satisfied, they will be told by the Minister that they have exhausted their remedy, and that they had better for ever hold their peace. That will inevitably be the reply made. &#39;However, I do not base my objections to the Bill so much on the grounds alleged in the petition as on higher and stronger grounds. First, there is already a method of arbitration for the determination of wages and conditions within the service. We have now a method of Public Service arbitration, which is apparently the best that Parliament has been able to devise. If it is imperfect, either as regards the constitution or the powers of the tribunal, it should be capable of being improved, and ought to be improved. If it is thought that the Public Service Commissioner should be reinforced and strengthened, or that instead of one Commissioner there .should be a board of three Commissioners, that would be one way, and a better way of dealing with the question. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of it. That board was actually recommended by the Postal Commission to deal with the internal management of the Postal Department, and, therefore, to deal with the employes of the Department. The development of one Commissioner into a board of three might give greater satisfaction and efficiency. My point, however, is that one Commissioner or a board of three Commissioners, constituted by the authority of Parliament and directly authorized to deal with these Public Service questions - consisting also of men with an expert and special knowledge of the Public Service - gives greater security for the rectification of grievances and the settlement of complaints consistent with the rights of the service as well as the rights of the public, than would be the case in the proposed reference to a Conciliation and Arbitration Court outside of the service. </para>

There is no proposal on my part to supersede Parliament. Even this Bill cannot do so. I want to impress on honorable members into what a <inline font-style="italic">cul-de-sac,</inline> the proposed Conciliation and Arbitration Court may find itself landed in dealing with Public Service questions. First I see it is proposed to invite the public servants to band themselves into organizations. The fundamental basis of the Bill apparently is to induce them to join unions. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that it is consistent with the fundamental principle of the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but at the same time it excludes the Arbitration Court from dealing with the wrongs or grievances of individual servants. An individual may have a complaint about unfair treatment, but he is not to be allowed to go to the Court unless he becomes a part oi a wide trade organization within the service. That, of course, merely goes to show the imperfection of the scheme. &#39; When the complaint or claim is formulated, it may relate to such questions as salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service  or  employment. At the present lime, under the Public Service Act, most of those functions have been delegated to the Public Service Commissioner, so that, apparently, that provision gives the right of appeal from the Public Service Commissioner to the Court. It is proposed also to drag the Public Service Commissioner before the Court. At present he is charged with semi-judicial functions, and judicial prerogatives, and yet he is to be called upon by this Bill to appear as an advocate in an appeal before the Court. That is subjecting him to an unnecessary indignity, because it assumes that he is a partisan, whereas he is not interested in sustaining his own recommendations or determinations. These complaints or claims are not to be investigated alone before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, the ideal Judge, and the ideal arbitrator according to the views of some people, but he is to be authorized to refer any claim to a Judge of a Supreme Court, or a police stipendiary, or special magistrate, or other person authorized by the Governor-General to investigate and report. This Bill, therefore, practically gives a right of appeal, not to the Arbitration Court, but to the persons to whom the Court may delegate its functions. There is no provision as to the place where these references are to take place. It may be assumed from the scheme of the Bill that the central Federal Arbitration Court is now, as it were, to be broken up and disintegrated into a number of branches, or delegated authorities, in different parts of the Commonwealth. These may possibly lay down lines of policy inconsistent with one another for the settlement of disputes, and we may, therefore, have a variety of decisions relating to Public Service matters in different parts of the country, varying according to the different views or idiosyncrasies of the various persons to whom the references have been made. Therefore, we shall have nothing like uniformity, consistency, or harmony within the service. At present there are comparatively uniform rates of pay and conditions of employment in it, with certain exceptions in the tropical regions. My strongest objection to the proposed delegation is that it gives to functionaries, whose qualifications may be unknown, jurisdiction over delicate technical questions relating to the internal administration of the Government Departments. Some of these Judges, magistrates, or other authorized persons may have no knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the inside workings of the various Departments. </para>

In any integrated service you must have consistency and harmony of design and execution in the carrying out of its work, and in the appointment of its awards and emoluments. An inherent weakness and infirmity of this scheme, which will help to make it break down, is the variety of officers sitting independently whom it is proposed to call into existence. One may fairly call attention to the position that may arise upon a determination by any Arbitration Court or delegated authority. </para>

                    <para>It is probable than many of the complaints of the public servants are due to the state of the law, and for that reason the Commissioner cannot redress some of the grievances that are brought before him. The Bill indeed contemplates the possibility of awards being made contrary to the law of the Commonwealth. Such awards, however, could not have force, and in those cases, therefore, no redress would be gained from an appeal to the Court. Where grievances are due to the existing law they cannot be remedied except by the amendment of that law, to secure which an appeal must be made to the Ministry and&#39; to Parliament. An award contrary to the Public Service or the Appropriation Acts, or the regulations thereunder, would have <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> force. The Bill provides that if an award is contrary to the law of the Commonwealth, a report shall be submitted to Parliament, and either House may, within thirty days, pass a resolution disapproving of it, in which case it shall not come into operation. It is needless to provide that an award inconsistent with Commonwealth law shall not operate if vetoed by either House. Such an award would not operate in any case, and must be null and void. The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration cannot provide funds for giving effect to an award increasing wages or other expenditure. The award could not operate until there had been a Parliamentary appropriation to provide for its operation. </para>

The public servants will be no better off than they are now in appealing, to the Arbitration Court in respect to some grievance which the Commissioner cannot remedy, because his hands are tied by Parliamentary enactment. The advantages offered to the Public Service by the Bill are illusionary. The public servants would be much better off by appealing to the Ministry and to Parliament. There is no need for the Bill, and it has not been asked for by those interested. Its introduction is due to a party cry. The complaints of the public servants are fully ventilated, as shown by the evidence given before the Postal Commission ; and where they are due to the state of the law, that can be remedied only by its amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill, because I believe it is likely to be of advantage to the whole service, which is now reeking with discontent, especially in regard to the rank and file. The public servants will feel that they are under a juster system when they have the right to appeal to an unbiased tribunal. It has been said that the Bill has not. been asked for; but if it is not needed, why are honorable members inundated with complaints from individual officers&#39; and from associations? Like many other members, I have declined to receive individual complaints. I have said to individual officers. &#34; Form yourselves into an association, and, having considered the matter, make a complaint on behalf of the association.&#39;1 Any complaint so made must have a good foundation. The associations will be very careful about bringing complaints before the Arbitration Court, because they will know that the hearing of them will be public, and that if they really have no grievances they will be ridiculed by the community and even by their friends. It has been said that the Commissioner is in the position of an arbitrator, but he cannot be regarded as a fair and just arbitrator. He must give satisfaction to the Ministry. Although lie is not responsible for the running of any Department, he determines how many men shall be employed in it. It is not possible for him to travel all over the Commonwealth, hearing complaints and rectifying grievances. Consequently, he has to depend on the reports of inspectors, who interview and are guided by the heads of Departments. If one of die rank and file makes a complaint, he becomes a marked man. He is not discharged, but he presently finds himself transferred somewhere. In Tasmania he is sent to the purgatory of the service in that State - the west coast. The acid is applied in such a way that he cannot prove that he has cause of complaint, and in reply to any remonstrance he would be told, &#34; You have been given promotion, and are getting extra pay.&#34; The Bill will have the effect of forming &#39;the service into associations which will bring real grievances before the Court. It was recently my privilege to attend a conference which discussed public servants&#39; grievances. One very real grievance is that a regulation has recently been made enabling letter-carriers to be promoted to letter-sorting. As the maximum pay of a letter-carrier is ^156, and the minimum of a letter-sorter <inline font-style="italic">&#163;144;</inline> _ die carrier who is promoted may be receiving more than men who have been sorting for years. </para>

                            <para>- The . Arbitration Court will deal with all just grievances. The honorable member for South Sydney has had great experience in connexion with arbitration. I base my argument on the statement made by &#39; that, honorable member. As one illustration of the way in which&#39; - men were misled, when they were asked, to sign ..the petition which has been presented to the House by the honorable member for Bendigo, I would draw attention to the reference in it to the great cost of going before the Court. As a matter of fact, the cost, if any, will be very slight. The Bill provides that no costs shall be allowed in respect of any proceeding, and that neither side shall be represented by counsel or solicitor. Then, again, it is urged that we have no precedent for this action. As a matter of fact, the railway employes of New South Wales are under the State Arbitration Court, and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the system there is working satisfactorily. No doubt they dispose of their grievances by means of conciliatory Boards, rendering it quite unnecessary to go to the Court itself. A further statement in the petition is that this measure will take away from public servants the right of appeal to Parliament. It will do nothing of the sort ; so that in this respect also men who signed the petition were misled. It is interesting to note that the petition is signed by only 5,000 public servants, although there are some 20,000 permanent and casual men in the Commonwealth service. All these will have the privilege of going before the Court, and of bringing their grievances before it at very little cost, whilst they will still retain the right of appeal to this Legislature. Had those who signed the petition known that that would be the position I do not think that they would have attached their names to it. What chance had the average man in the Public Service of knowing what the Bill contained, seeing that, as a matter of fact, even members of Parliament other than Ministers were not aware of its provisions until it was introduced? We have in our service some genuine captains of labour who are excellent administrators. That has been demonstrated in Victoria by the administration of one of the heads of Departments, and if we had a few more like him public servants would not be likely to avail themselves of the opportunity of appealing to the Federal Court to the extent that they will do if certain gentlemen continue to remain in power in the several Departments. Those who will most feel the effects of the application of this principle to the Commonwealth service will be the men who have not been administering their Departments to the advantage either of the service or themselves. I remember a time when a man in the Public Service dared not make a complaint, and when justice was denied many public officers. With the advent of Federation, however, and as the Department to which I refer expanded, greater facilities were afforded the men for bringing their grievances under the notice of the departmental head. I understand that the old Board of Appeal system has been done away with, but a case once came under my notice in which an officer who had committed some breach of the regulations had his appeal dealt with by a Board composed of responsible officers under the head of the Department from whose decision he was appealing. Was it likely that those officers would go against the decision of the head of the Department? Was it not reasonable to assume that they would follow the line of least resistance, and agree with the determination of their chief? The passing of this Bill will introduce a system far superior to that now in existence. It will bring about a better state of affairs than now prevails, because the men will know that if they have a grievance they will be able to submit it to a Court which will take full evidence, and give a decision based upon that evidence. I am confident that members of Parliament, after this Bill comes into operation, will not be troubled as they are now by public servants anxious to submit grievances to them, with a view of their bringing influence to bear in a certain direction, in order that justice may be done them. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said that this Bill would do an act of justice to our public servants; but I find that not only have they not asked for it, but that they are distinctly opposed to it. Only one reason can be assigned for its introduction. The unfortunate trouble which arose in connexion with the post and telegraph service no doubt led to the framing of this measure, which is designed simply to enable the Minister to shirk his responsibility. Unwilling to meet the case fairly., and to say whether the men are right or wrong, he attempts to get out of the responsibility resting upon him as Ministerial head of his Department by saying, &#34; I shall transfer to a Justice of the High Court the responsibility which properly devolves upon me.&#34; Complaint has been made of the power vested in the Public Service Commissioner, and I am one of those who have taken the view that the system now obtaining under Commissioner control is far from perfect. It is practically impossible for any one man to make himself thoroughly familiar with the workings of a. service extending from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the southernmost parts of Tasmania on the one side and from Perth to Sydney on the other. Even allowing that he is influenced by the best of intentions, we have to remember that his decisions depend upon information that filters to him through what has a tendency, I am afraid, to become a small Conservative inner circle immediately surrounding the Commissioner. Such a state of affairs is inevitable under the existing system ; but we are now going to create a still more powerful autocrat. A man who will not have the slightest knowledge of the conditions of the services will sit in judgment on the service, and his decisions will depend on the evidence submitted to him, which must be biased on both sides. No Judge, unless he were an angel from Heaven, could enter into a consideration of the legitimate grievances of public servants as fairly and fully as can the Minister at the head of the Department concerned, and who is responsible all the time to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- A Minister has a much better chance of doing so than the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will have. Honorable members opposite have said that Commonwealth public servants, if dissatisfied with an award of the Court, will be able to appeal to the Parliament. The Bill does not provide for anything of the kind. The decision of the Court in all cases will be absolutely final, unless the award made fails to come within the four corners of the existing law. To illustrate the position, let us take the case of the Sydney telegraphists. If the Court decided to-morrow that the time worked by those men should be extended in common with that of men in various industries to eight hours a day, there could be no appeal from that award to this Parliament. The award could be upset only by the passing of another Act of Parliament. There is absolutely no appeal from an award of the Court so long as that award is within the existing law. </para>

                            <para>- I was pointing out that some honorable members are sup- porting this Bill on the ground that if the employes are not satisfied they may appeal to this Parliament. The Bill distinctly provides, however, that so long as an award is within the four corners of the law, there is no appeal to this Parliament, except that general appeal which is the right of every citizen. It must be distinctly understood that the award of the Arbitration Court is absolutely final, unless it is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline></para>

There are, we are told, about 16,000 permanent officers and 4,000 temporary officers in the Commonwealth service, and this petition is signed by  5,000.  I have not seen any petition of public servants in favour of being brought under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

                            <para>- That is only playing with words, because this Bill is instituting an Arbitration Court for the public servants. Undoubtedly the whole trouble has arisen in connexion with the postal and telegraph officials, who made requests to the Minister, and gave evidence before the Royal Commission. In my opinion, the Government have not the pluck to either decline or accede to these requests; and they have introduced this Bill in order to relieve themselves of responsibility. The Bill is nothing but a cowardly attempt- </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it is not parliamentary, and I withdraw it. But there is a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to shirk the responsibility of administering the Public Service. Continuous complaints are made by honorable members opposite that an autocrat has been created in the Public Service Commissioner, who has taken from Parliament the right to decide these very matters. Yet it is now sought to create a much stronger and quite irresponsible autocrat, who, on evidence given, will have to decide the pay, the hours, and other conditions of a huge service, the conditions in the various branches of which are as varying as the climate throughout Australia. It is a mistake for Parliament to surrender its power and responsibility ; and such a step, instead of creating satisfaction, will arouse much greater antagonism in the Public Service. The Bill will only add to the long list of failures in legislation passed without due consideration, and intended merely as a temporary expedient to enable the Government to evade the responsibility cast upon them by the report of the Royal Commission. It is for the Government and the Parliament to say whether the recommendations made by that Commission should be carried out or not ; and I trust that this Bill will not be accepted by the House. </para>

                        <para>.- I am somewhat surprised at the light and airy way in which a Bill of this character is received by the House. It seems to me that we are endeavouring to do something by a new process of law that we should find it very difficult to do under the old Statute. The question before us is whether the Public Service should be brought under the jurisdiction of an Arbitration Court; and I may be pardoned for expressing a doubt whether we have power under the Constitution to do so - whether &#34; industrial affairs &#34; embraces the Public Service. In spite of opinions expressed to the contrary,  1  do not think that the framers of the Constitution ever contemplated that the section would apply to the Public Service. The arguments that have been put forward from time to time by different members as to the possibility of doing this are somewhat incomplete. If we have the constitutional power to place the Public Service under the Federal Arbitration Court surely the rational thing to do would be immediately to remove from existing Statutes the provisions which must clash with this measure. I undertake to say that there has never been in any country in the world a condition like that which has been created in the Commonwealth Public Service. I hold no brief for the public servants, but I do hold a brief for the public and for members of this House who think they are going to escape, by means of this Bill, something which it will really intensify tenfold. I must speak as my conscience dictates, and when the time comes that I cannot do so I shall know what to do. I tell the Government frankly that in trying to escape from one difficulty they are creating a greater. This is not, and never has been, a party question. It is rather a great public question. The Public Service is founded upon the Public Service Act, which gives to the Public Service Commissioner certain powers that are not merely regulative, but administrative, and that, even though this Bill is carried, will still stand. The Public Service Act directs that the Public Service Commissioner shall appoint inspectors to inspect each and every Department, examine, as far as practicable, the officers thereof, ascertain their duties and the value of their services, hear and inquire into all matters or things respecting or relating to the working of the Departments, and furnish, in writing, to the Commissioner a full report of every such inspection, examination, or inquiry, including recommendations for the consideration and determination of the Commissioner himself. He therefore holds the position of an arbitrator. He is supposed to act as a check between the chief officer of each Department and the Treasurer. Again, the chief officers, formerly called the permanent heads, are charged with the duty of reporting upon the efficiency and capacity and the value of the work of every servant under them. Each chief officer, therefore, is charged with the responsibility through his own officers - not the officers of the Public Service Commissioner - of ascertaining and assessing the value of the services of every officer under him. Then the Public Service Commissioner comes in as the arbitrator as to whether that assessment has been correctly made or not, and up to now, at any rate, the Public Service Commissioner has been the man upon whom Parliament has relied to guard the interests of the Government and of the service. Today, therefore, we have the chief officer valuing the services of every man under him, and we have the Public Service Inspectors, who are supposed to be capable, and who are alleged by themselves and their chief to be capable, also assessing the value of the work. Now, still another tribunal is being created by the Postal Department, which is advertising for two officers, one to take charge of the clerical and professional branches and the other to take charge of the general division. They are to be appointed to the Central Office. Any one who has taken notice of the conflict between the Central Office and the Public Service Commissioner all through the years of Federation must know what has resulted from Central Office control. The other day, I asked the Minister what the duties of these two new officers were to be, and received the usual evasive reply. The Department has been characteristic lately for not giving the replies which straight questions demand. It evades and equivocates in a way that is not creditable to any Department that should deal straightforwardly with members of this House. If the two new officers are to be of any use to the service, and not simply to encumber the Central Office further, they will have to travel throughout Australia, because the divisions with which they will deal extend throughout Australia. Any man who has to see that there is no malingering, that the work is properly done, and the service in each branch efficient, must travel from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. If those officers are to do that, it should be so stated ; if not, I fail to see what is to be gained by interposing them at the very time when the Government are bringing in some other machinery. So far, then, I have shown that the Public Service is subject, as it were, to the decisions of three tribunals. </para>

                            <para>- I am outlining the present position of the service, in order to show exactly what will happen when the Bill is passed. We shall have, first, the chief officers assessing the value of the services, the Public Service Commissioner arbitrating on that valuation in the second place, and then two new officers of the Central Office arbitrating on the conclusions of the Public Service Commissioner and the chief officers for the enlightenment of the Central Office, the Central Office being able to take action on their reports, irrespective of the Public Service Commissioner. Any proposal of that kind must come into conflict with the powers given to the Public Service Commissioner under the Act. So far, then, we have three tribunals, and now this Bill is brought in to superimpose a fourth. Under it, the Court will arbitrate on the merits or demerits of the decisions of the three tribunals already in existence in the Department. I could understand an Arbitration Court having power to review wages and conditions even in a Public Service, provided they had been fixed by one authority. As it is, we have a number of authorities who may differ materially, as they have done in the past, and who, when their evidence comes before the Arbitration Court, will undoubtedly make confusion worse confounded than it is to-day. The  effect of this Bill will be to quadruplicate the tribunals which decide the positions of the civil servants. I very much doubt whether any Arbitration Court can deal efficiently with the ramifications of the Public Service, and I certainly doubt whether it can deal with them more efficiently than can the men who are managing the Department, so long as those men are efficient. I am told that this proposal can be justified because the railway service, which is managed by Commissioners, has been brought under the Arbitration Court in New South Wales. There is a fundamental difference between the railway service and the general Public Service. The Railways Commissioners are given definite powers with regard to wages. They have their staff committees who assess the value of the services of their employes, and the Commissioners are a board of appeal. There you have the management focussed in one tribunal, without conflicting assessors. The position of the Commonwealth service is fundamentally different. If we had placed our Public Service under a board similar to the Railways Commissioners, and without the intervention of the Public Service Commissioner, an analogy might have been drawn. I came to this House just after the Parliament of New South Wales, at the end of a long series of disastrous strikes, had passed an Arbitration Act, but I candidly confess now that the views which I expressed in my enthusiasm for the measure have been changed by experience. Regarding the application of arbitration to public servants, let me read what has been said by a gentleman who has attended professionally in the Arbitration Court of New South Wales for years, and now occupies the position of Secretary for Lands for the State. Some time ago, when Minister of Public Instruction, he was asked by the school teachers under him whether there was any departmental objection to the formation of a trade union consisting of teachers.  His  reply was - </para>

Various classifications and grades make regulation of the staff a very complex problem, and the administration must be entirely free from external influences. I am strongly of opinion that the professional and clerical divisions of the Public Service should not be covered by industrial legislation, as Parliament can always be directly appealed to on all big questions relating to salary and systems of promotion.

Those who know anything of the Public Service are aware that in the same office there may be men doing apparently the same work whose qualifications and merits are quite different, one being required to use his brains and the other being practically a mere automaton. It would be difficult for any one not conversant with Public Service conditions to deal with questions affecting employment. The work would be much better done by a Board of experts. </para>

The Public Service Commissioner, after declaring repeatedly that certain things were right, has, later on, admitted that they were wrong. Devolution is the order of the day all over the world. In Great Britain the postal service is controlled now by surveyors, of whom there are five in England, three in Scotland, and two in Ireland, each having his own district, and being responsible for the working of it without reference to the central office in London. </para>

                            <para>- I sometimes think that it will be impossible to speak here. While other countries are decentralizing, we are centralizing. The Bill is a move towards centralization. What will happen under it no one can say, but, undoubtedly, if advantage is taken of its provisions, there will be so much conflict with the rules  of the Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors that Parliament will have to seriously amend the law. We are centralizing our postal administration, although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Scott and others have said that centralization is not calculated to serve the best interests of the Department. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in a position to say, but I understand that a petition signed by  4,000  of them has been presented to the House, praying that the service may not be brought under the arbitration law, and I have been told that, had not the petition been hurriedly got up, a great many more names would have been attached to it. As to the right of the Public Service Commissioner to be represented before the Court, I take it that he will not have the right to employ legal or expert assistance, but merely to appoint some one to take his place should he be unable to attend in person.  Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause  6  allows the Court to fix maximum penalties, not exceeding &#163;ro, for any breach or non-observance of an award. In another part of the Bill it is provided that every award made by the Court under this Act must be laid on, the table of both Houses of Parliament, and that either House may, by resolution, refuse to indorse an award. In the case of private employers, both the employer and the  employe&#39;  can be fined for breach of an award of the Court, but under this Bill, whilst the employe will be liable to a penalty of &#163;10 for non-observance of an award, no penalty can be enforced against the other side for breach of an award. The position is illogical. </para>

                            <para>- Under that clause the Public Service Commissioner and the permanent heads and chief officers, in common with all Commonwealth servants, are required to comply with the provisions of an award or order of the Court. But if Parliament vetoes an award, of what use will such a provision be? My contention is that the Parliament of the Commonwealth in this connexion occupies the position of an employer, and that the law that requires private employers, as well as employes, to obey an award of the Court will not apply to the Parliament as the employers of the public servants of the Commonwealth under this measure. It is a one-sided proposal that declares that employés must comply with an award of the Court, but leaves it free to the Parliament, which stands in the position of the employer, to refuse to comply with an award. </para>

                            <para>- I think I can see as far into this matter as can the Attorney-General. I repeat that either House of Parliament may veto an award, or, in other words, set it aside, whereas an employé will be liable to a fine of &#163;10 for breach of an order of the Court. Herein we see the difficulty of applying to the Public Service the principle of arbitration. No employer can be brought before the Court in this case, save the officials who are acting under an Act of Parliament for which this Legislature is responsible. There is, therefore, grave reason for doubt whether this Bill will bring about the improvement that we desire. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Justice</inline> Heydon, the Court may make an award decreasing a payment, but an award granting a payment in excess of that provided by Act of Parliament must go before the Parliament ; so that if this Parliament considered in any case that the extra payment for which an award provided should not be made, it would refuse to vote the necessary funds. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e,</inline> of clause  6,  power is given to the Court to make an award a common rule of the Public Service. This provision has apparently been taken from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act without any thought of its applicability to the case with which this measure is designed to deal. I could understand a common rule being declared in regard to all men engaged in bricklaying, stonecutting, or in carrying out any mechanical work, but one has only to enter any branch office of the Public Service in the Union - the accountancy, correspondence, miscellaneous, or any other branch of the service - to realize how impossible it would be to make a common rule applying to all officers of any division of the service throughout Australia. The Chief Clerk of the Post and Telegraph Department in New South Wales, for instance, has an enormous volume of work to deal with, and is frequently called upon to relieve the Deputy Postmaster-General. He is, therefore, entitled to a high rate of remuneration, but are we gtV.ng to say that there should be a common rule declaring that the Chief Clerk of the Department in every State should receive the same salary. </para>

                            <para>- Under &#163;t common rule, only a minimum could be struck. Here, again, we come into conflict with the existing authorities. If a minimum were fixed with regard to the value of the lowest paid, then the whole fabric of the Public Service classification would go by the board. The principle of the common rule is inapplicable to this case. It could hardly be applied to any one section of the service throughout Australia, although it might be applied to a branch of the service in any one State. Then, again, how would it be possible for the  President  of the Court to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins did when he desired to obtain an insight into the work of the shearers ? How would it be possible for him to personally inspect the operations and work of all the officers of the service? Another provision to which I desire to draw attention is that the Court shall have power to remit claims or matters for reference to a Judge of a State Court, or a police stipendiary, or special magistrate of the Commonwealth, or of a State, for investigation and report. It is in this respect that we see the fallacy of the statement made by my honorable friend the Attorney-General that we are going to appoint an expert who will be able to form an expert judgment on all these matters. </para>

                            <para>- Then I misunderstood the honorable member. I take it that the Government will appoint an expert Registrar, and that under this clause the Registrar may refer any case to any one of these several authorities. But will they be experts ? I take it that the reason for this provision is that the Registrar will be located at the Seat of Government, and that it is proposed that any one of these persons may be appointed to investigate a claim in order to suit his convenience. What sort of a hybrid Court shall we have under this proposal ? We certainly shall not have a Court presided over by a Judge who is specially qualified to dissect evidence and to form a judgment upon the evidence submitted to him. We have no guarantee that any one of these persons will be as able to discharge the functions of an arbitrator as are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and other learned Justices, who have made this work a specialty. In this provision we see a danger of the Court being neither efficient nor effective for the work it will have to do. </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, the Court will have power to determine a claim on the report of any one of these persons without hearing any evidence. That is a dangerous power, and I am afraid that it must lead to trouble and discontent. There is another provision that, wherever an award clashes with the Public Service Act, or any other Act, or any regulation under an Act, the award cannot stand. In the name of Providence, what sort of a position is this? Much embarrassment must be caused to men who have to present their case without legal assistance. With that condition in the Arbitration Court I do not disagree; but it is difficult to understand how the public servants are to know when they are not going to come into conflict with some Commonwealth law or regulation. They may present their case to the best of their ability, only to be told that the award cannot hold; and, candidly, I cannot see how the public servants are going to get any redress under this measure. I see no reason for the introduction of the Bill under present conditions. Of course, such a measure would be all right if there were no Public Service Act, and if the management were in the hands of a board of control with staff committees. Clause 13 provides - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>No award, order, or directio&#39;n of the Court made under this Act shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question, or be subject to prohibition or mandamus, in any other Court on any account whatever. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that there is no appeal, except where increased pay may be given, arid then, of course, that is reviewed by Parliament. This is a most unusual state of affairs in arbitration matters. I have not had time to look into these provisions as I should wish, not being aware that the Bill was to come on for consideration to-day; but I venture to say, from my general reading and study of the subject, that there will hardly be an award which will not come into conflict with some section or regulation of the Public Service Act. We cannot create content when there is not a just method of settling differences. If we could wipe the Public Service Act out of existence, and start under entirely new conditions, it might be all right, but we are trying to fit in new conditions with old ones with which they cannot work ; in short, I think that  a  hotch-potch has been made of the whole business. I candidly admit that it hurts me to have to criticise this measure in this determined way. Did I know less of the subject I should probably not be found offering these comments ; but I have looked into the general question so closely - and I am sure honorable members will give me credit for putting my heart into the work - that I feel we are taking a wrong step to-day - a step which will increase rather than cure the evils complained of. As a matter of fact, the troubles of the past will appear infinitesimal when compared with the troubles of the future under  a  measure of this kind. The public servants are told that they must go to the Arbitration Court in all cases ; but we know that in a&#62; clerical division, officers of the fifth-class had their maximum salary increased from &#163;r6o to &#163;180, thus going beyond the limit fixed by law. This increase was done by a process of long-service increments. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of the general division, but of the clerical division ; and I may say that the minimum was fixed from ^40 to &#163;60 in certain cases. The Attorney-General, therefore, did by a side wind what he could not do in a straight way; and I take it that the later increase to &#163;200 a year will also need ratification by an Act of Parliament. Why such a measure was not introduced before this Bill I am at a loss to know. I hope the Government do not intend to delay the ratification in order that the matter may be submitted to the Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but ratification is also necessary of the increases recently granted. I need not detain honorable members further than to say that this Bill can only have the effect of intensifying the confusion in the Public Service. The officers will have their positions subject to review, first by the heads of Departments, then by the Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors, then by the two new officers appointed to instruct the central officers, and, I suspect, to advise Ministers over the head of the Public Service Commissioner, then by the Arbitration Court, and, finally, by Parliament. What is likely to be the lot of public servants who have to run the gauntlet of all these authorities before the award for his services can be fixed ? No similar position can be found in any other part of the world. Why should the tribunals not be confined to two - namely, a board of control, with staff committees, and then the Arbitration Court to decide in cases where the public servants are not satisfied ? Why not remove the intermediate confusing and duplicating instrumentalities, and have something tangible, logical, and effective? We should then get better results for the public, and the civil servants would know where they were. We are starting to legislate in this matter in too much of  a  hurry, and without stopping to reflect upon what is necessary to make our legislation effective. A step of this kind cannot fail to have an irritating effect, not only upon the Public Service, but upon the Government, upon, the members of this House, and upon the public outside. Those members who think it will get rid of political influence have never made a greater mistake in their lives. When the Arbitration Court gives an award against any section of these men, do honorable members expect that, having full citizen rights, as they ought to have, they will fail to use their right of appealing to Parliament if they feel they have been wrongfully treated? We cannot shut that door. The question then is : Are we opening it still wider and increasing the trouble, making the future harder for individual members, for the service and for the public? This Bill will be, in my judgment, no credit to the Parliament that passes it. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather afraid that my remarks on this question will not receive the same commendation from the Opposition as have those of the honorable member for Gwydir. At the same time I recognise that the honorable member did not look for the cheers of honorable members opposite, because he spoke what he felt. I suppose I am as much interested in the welfare of the members of the Public Service as any one else in this Chamber, and, perhaps,&#39; more so, because I have such an extraordinary number of them in my electorate. For years the Public Service organizations, the movement to which I belong, individual members of the service, and myself, have been fighting to have the public servants placed on the same plane as every other citizen. We have said, all along, that they do not get the same justice and the same opportunities to appeal against officialdom as other citizens enjoy. There is now placed on the table a Bill, with which I admit I am not in full accord, but which, seeing that our present system is admittedly faulty, at least offers a better opportunity of achieving what we want. I believe that the Public Service Commissioner, who at present holds in the palm of his hand the wellbeing, or the undoing, of the members of the Public Service, is doing his best, but I agree with the honorable member for Gwydir that the outcome of the present system has not been as good as many of us expected. The honorable member said this Bill would bring about more political influence than the present system, but, personally, I cannot conceive of anything which would induce the men in the Public Service to endeavour to use political influence more than the present system does. All honorable members must have known many cases of dissatisfaction among the public servants. We quite understand that, because it is the right of every Britisher to growl, and to try to improve his position. After all, that is only human. The honorable member for Gwydir says that, under this Bill, the appeals of public servants will not be decided by a practical man, but it will be almost impossible to have greater grumbling under any system than we have under the present. We have now a practical man placed in the position of Public Service Commissioner, surrounded by inspectors and heads of Departments, who are supposed to inform him truly as to the relative merits of every position in the service, and of the individual who fills it. Yet many men have, undoubtedly, been overlooked and slighted, others, junior to them, and inferior to them in knowledge and experience, being promoted over their heads. Those things happen under the present system, and no redress seems to be possible. The Postal Commission suggested the appointment of a board of control. I believe that would be better than the present arrangement, because three men are more likely than one man to give justice. Our experience in the Public Service has been that it is almost impossible for one man, reared in the service, to give a proper ruling as to the relative merits of men or positions. Perhaps the reason is that, having been reared in officialdom, he is unable to apply ordinary common-sense deductions to the problems presented to him. We have in the Public Service to-day men classed by the Act as in the General Division. This applies particularly to officers in the registration branch of the Postal Department. Their work is just as much clerical as that of any one in a clerical position. In fact, it is almost professional. They handle money all day long, and have to carry on the registration branch of the postal work, yet they are kept in the General Division under the misnomer of sorters. </para>

                            <para>- I admitted that the law was at fault. The honorable member for Gwydir said that we could not get beyond the Act, and instanced a case where Parliament had to carry a motion in order to increase the amount of money paid to certain public servants. If we had an outside tribunal to deal with these matters, it would tell Parliament frankly that we were  not paying the men as much as they ought to receive, and Parliament would then, if necessary, alter the Act. What I marvel at is this : For years the Labour party has been charged by the Opposition and the press with pandering to the public servants for their votes at election time, and with having induced public servants to place us in power, in order that they might get from us what they could not get from other Governments in the past. Perhaps that charge is to some extent true, because there are times when politicians of all parties on the hustings endeavour by all means to get people to vote for them. Yet while these men have been clamouring to be placed on the same footing as every other citizen, there are to be found among them a large number who object to be brought under the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I do not want to be too hard on them&#34;; but when public servants, who have always been complaining about bad treatment, object at their meetings, or by means of petitions, to be brought under an Act which should give them all they have been asking for, it makes me feel that they are rather afraid to present their cases to the Court because they think they are now getting as much as they are worth, or as much as their positions warrant. With the permission of the House, I shall conclude my speech on another day. </para>

                    <para>Nov. 30. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is not true that the representatives of the press in the galleries of this chamber are denied the opportunity to have their contradictions of our utterances concerning them published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I now give that opportunity to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond.</inline> Nor is it true that they are unable to defend themselves from our attacks. &#39; While we here speak to&#39; an audience of twenty-five or thirty persons, and our speeches are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which has a circulation throughout Australia of some 10,000 copies, but is hardly ever read, the statements made about us by our press critics are published in millions of copies of newspapers. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> each claims to be read by 100,000 persons daily. On the other hand, if we approach the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> we are denied the opportunity to have our letters published. Quite recently I sent a letter to that newspaper, but it was not allowed to appear. I have not been refused access to the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> but on two or three occasions I have been refused access to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> What chance then have we to defend ourselves, except here, and on the public platform ? I submit that, in attacking and naming certain pressmen recently, I was justified in my action, but I am prepared, if they - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sampson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whyte</inline> - deny the truth of my statements, to give publicity to their replies in the columns of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I connected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond</inline> with the article in <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> because it was commonly reported about the House that he was contributing the series to which it belonged, and several members, when I asked who was writing the articles, replied, <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Redmond.&#34;</inline></para>
                    <para>When I was Chairman of Committees in the Senate, a member of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> staff came to me, and asked for certain particulars about my career, which I gave. Later, there appeared three or four columns in <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> headed, &#34;A sketch of W. G. Higgs.&#34; I was not asked <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> for the publication of my photograph. A member of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> staff was writing for <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> on that occasion, and when he gave up the work, it was undertaken by another member of the same staff whom honorable members know. I was informed that he was succeeded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond</inline> denies that he writes for <inline font-style="italic">Punch.</inline></para>
                    <para>The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> places me before the public in an invidious light. In self-defence I think I am&#39; entitled to tell the House that yesterday afternoon, at 3 o&#39;clock, the honorable member for Maranoa came to me and said, &#34; I come to you with an olive branch. I have been asked to see you, and to ask you to withdraw the statement against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond.</inline> If you do, I have a guarantee from two of the pressmen that you will be fully reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in future.&#34; I replied, &#34; What do they think of me ? Do they think I have descended so low as to withdraw a statement which I believe to be true? I believe Redmond did write the article.&#34; The honorable member for Maranoa replied, &#34; I believe so, too;&#34; but he put it to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond</inline> would lose his position if I did not withdraw my statement, and that his wife and family would suffer. That appealed to me, and I consulted some of my friends on this side of the House, and asked if they thought that I should withdraw the statement, putting the case before them as I have just put it. Their reply was, &#34; In writing those articles he did not think of our wives and families.&#34; I had to agree that that was so. The men who slander this party have no consideration for the wives and families of those for whom we are fighting, the workers of the community. Nor have they consideration for our wives and friends, whom they slander by declaring that we have borrowed money from our opponents. Honorable members may draw their own conclusions. I tell the House that the only evidence I had that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond</inline> wrote the article was the common report in this House. It is my belief that there are honorable members who can give information that will show whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond</inline> is telling the truth when he says that he is not a contributor to <inline font-style="italic">Punch.</inline> Are honorable members prepared to do their duty by stating what they know, or do they propose to remain silent ? I have deemed it my duty to defend this party against accusations made against it of the character of that referred to in the paragraph which I quoted yesterday, and which the honorable member for Balaclava, as every one believed he would, promptly denied. I refer to the accusation that members of the Labour party in this Parliament were borrowing money from honorable members opposite. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know as well as I do that about the last thing that the wage earners and the Labour party outside would forgive is the borrowing of money by a Labour member from one of his political opponents. They recognise that immediately a man borrows from his opponents those opponents have him in their power. Knowing that we receive a salary of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,$00</inline> a year, they naturally expect us not to place ourselves under any obligation to political opponents. The statement to which I took exception was a shocking one to make concerning this party. Do honorable members opposite think that it is fair that pressmen, occupying seats in the galleries, who are placed on an equality with us, and who meet us apparently as friends, should resort to such, tactics ? Is it fair that men who, as representatives of the big daily newspapers, are licensed by this House to meet us and to discuss matters with us, should use information that they gather in the lobbies as material for paragraphs in Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> and like newspapers, with which the general public have no idea that they are connected ? </para>

                            <para>- It is more widely read than the honorable member thinks. Posters  advertising&#39; <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> together with illustrations from its pages, appear on all the railway hoardings. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning&#39; published a fairly accurate report of the proceedings yesterday, but, despite its boasted honour and fair play, it protected the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> when I think it should have exposed what is undoubtedly &#171;. scandal. There are honorable members who can say whether or not it is true that representatives of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> have approached them with a view of inducing them to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> each for the publication of their photographs, and an article relating to them. I am not going to mention names, but it is well known that certain honorable members have been so approached, and they ought to be prepared to stand up and say so. I understand that at least four or five members have paid &#163;$ each for the publication of their photographs in <inline font-style="italic">Punch.</inline> I did not propose to mention any names, but the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> who is well known throughout Australia, and whose word, I am sure, we shall all readily accept, has given me permission to state that a man from Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> office waited on him, and offered for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> to publish his photograph in that newspaper. And this is journalism I In Melbourne. <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> today honorable members will find cartoons vilifying this party and parliamentarians generally throughout Victoria. Yet this newspaper, which pretends to be the custodian of the honour and integrity of the State, has descended, so low that it is prepared to accept money to publish photographs of individuals. These photographs appear over articles which are deemed to embody the genuine and honest thought and opinions of the writer. </para>

                            <para>- This practice means that the man who is not prepared to pay <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> will be treated by Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> as the honorable member for Denison - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laird</inline> Smith - was treated by it in a recent issue. It means, in other words, that Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> is prepared to descend to blackmail.  If it demands ,&#163;5 for the insertion of a photograph of a member, accompanied by an article concerning him, there is no reason why it should not adopt the tactics of another newspaper in the Commonwealth, which is said to have caused an article to be written concerning a prominent politician, and to have sent it along to him with an inquiry as to how much it was worth to keep it out. If journalists engaged in this building will only cast back their minds over the paragraphs they have written about this party, and about members of Parliament generally, they will have to admit, I think, that it is about time some member of the Parliament should .&#39;have the courage to stand up against them. This is not the first time I have felt it my duty to stand up against the press, and I suppose it will not be the last. I do not desire, however, to pursue the matter. </para>

                        <para>. - As my name has been mentioned I may say that, last year, I was approached and told that if I desired to have a good, satisfactory article in <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> similar to that written about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> I could have one if I paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;s ;</inline> but I said that if the <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> people wanted  ,&#163;5  out of me they would have to wait a long time. Eventually an article did appear about me, and it was simply one of the best advertisements I ever had in my electorate, because my constituents know me well enough to be certain that what was stated was not the truth. Then some one in Victoria sent a clipping from . the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to a friend  of mine in Tasmania, and asked him what he thought of myself. That article described me as being so proud of my name Smith as to add &#34; Laird &#34; to it, and declared that I always posed in the House as a man of considerable weight. As I happen to be very thin I do not know that I carry any more weight than, did either the article in <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> or the one in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> both of which were of similar import. </para>

If I have blamed an innocent man, I shall be very sorry, for doubtless he has suffered. But, at any rate, there must be some brotherhood among pressmen, and I hope the writer of the article immediately under discussion will have the manliness to admit the fact. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to call the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that, in the remoter parts of Western Australia, the medical officers are refusing to examine claimants for invalid pensions on account of the low fee offered. Several telegrams dealing with this matter have reached me recently. </para>

                        <para>. - From time to time complaints have been made about the fees paid to medical officers for examining applicants for invalid and old-age pensions. There is no doubt that, in Western Australia, medical fees are very high; but I think the medical profession might very well not be so particular when called upon to deal with applicants for such pensions. At any rate, I shall look into the matter. </para>
