                        <para>. - In approaching the subject of arbitration and conciliation, both sides of the House must realize that we are dealing with a problem which presses for solution in other countries besides our own, but it must be admitted that in Australia a general desire has been shown to obtain, both by Commonwealth and by State legislation, a peaceful method of settling industrial and economic disputes. It was not to be expected that one piece, of legislation would do all that was desired in that direction. Such legislation must be experimental in its nature, and as defects appear, or hardships arise, the law must be amended to deal with them. The- recognition of mistakes, and the readiness to deal with them, should be put to our credit. The Bill purports to be an attempt to improve the legislation of the last ten years, but the Attorney-General in introducing it did not give us any reason for the amendments proposed, except in regard to one particular matter. The Leader of the Opposition having moved an amendment on the motion for the second reading, the Prime Minister rose to reply, but he did not grapple with the real questions involved, and with a few remarks brushed the subject aside, saying nothing about the manner' in which the Government intended to face the difficulties of the situation. The Leader of the Opposition has challenged, on three distinct points, the expediency of passing the Bill. He objects, first, that its effect would be to concentrate all power over all industries throughout the Commonwealth in the hands of one person; secondly, that such legislation must be impracticable; and, thirdly, that it is fraught with danger to the community. Dealing with the first point, let me draw attention to a provision which I think the Attorney-General will be well advised to excise from the Bill. We are asked to enact that no order of the Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, or mandamus in any other Court on any account whatever. Under the principal Act, industrial disputes are to be decided by a Judge, who is not bound by strict technicalities such as the rules regarding the admissibility of evidence. He is free and untrammelled to do justice according to equity and good conscience, without regard to technicalities and legal forms. But if questions of law arise, the  President  may, if he thinks fit, state a case for appeal. The Prime Minister said that there was an appeal; and, of course, there is. But what sort of appeal? Is there any appeal which enables the whole weight of evidence to be reviewed? The aim and intention of the section is that the President's judgment shall prevail, and that there can be appeal only on questions of law. Notwithstanding the present section, there has been some control1 of the Court, and it is only right there should be. Otherwise, the Court could, at its own sweet will, wander all over Australia without being subject to review. At the present time, if the Court exceeds its jurisdiction, the High Court can be appealed to - for what is known as a. writ of prohibition, so that the  President  is not allowed to- decide matters not specially referred to him by the authority of the Statute. Are the words " prohibition or mandamus " which are now proposed to be inserted to be put in for purely ornamental purposes, or do they express some intention? "I give the Attorney-General credit when he asks us seriously to amend a fundamental part of our statute, that he has some reason; and we have to ask what that reason is. To this question the honorable member for Flinders failed to obtain a satisfactory answer. The only object, obviously, is to make this Court absolutely free and uncontrolled - to determine, if it pleases, the bounds of its own  statutory jurisdiction. The one Justice is to be the sole authority in the matter. If that is the intention, it cannot be carried out according to the Constitution; and, if the clause be inserted, the Government are only inviting defeat, however right and just it might be to make the provision. Is it right or just, and according to British precedent that this absolute and complete authority should be given, not subject to any control ? Such a proposition is unusual in British law. </para>

In Clancy's case, in New South Wales, it was held by the Supreme Court, and confirmed by the High Court, that, notwithstanding a clause similar to this in the existing Commonwealth Statute, a writ of prohibition lay. </para>

                            <para>- In Clancy's case it was held and confirmed by the High Court, that, under the then Statute of New South Wales, the State Supreme Court had power of control, and that the only way the State Parliament could get rid of that control was by expressly excluding the jurisdiction. The State Parliament has that power, because it is completely sovereign within its own boundaries; but the Parliament of the Commonwealth is bound by the Constitution. In the case of the Commonwealth there is inherent in the High Court original jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition; and what power have we, from a legislative point of view, to take that away from the High Court? As to the merits of the case, is it right and just, when dealing with a continent like this, to leave it to one person to decide even the jurisdiction which he is to exercise? In the report of Clancy's case, 1 C.L.R., page 197, the Judge said - </para>

We are not looking for temporary advantage for one party or the other, but for what is fair and just, in order to incorporate it as a permanent part of the legal procedure of this country in respect to economic justice. I am pleading for a sound principle, and urging that, as a matter of law, the High Court should always have the power to keep the Conciliation and Arbitration Court within the confines of the jurisdiction conferred upon, it by this Parliament.

It is not to constitute a board of trade, or a municipal body with power to make by-laws to regulate trade, but a Court of Arbitration, for hearing and determining industrial disputes in matters referred to it.

Is that not right and just, as a matter of principle? Otherwise, the Judge of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court could have practically unlimited jurisdiction.

                            <para>- That is not so, but I submit that by abolishing the writ of prohibition we are taking from the High Court the power to control and keep within defined bounds the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I am not speaking from a personal point of view. A judgment delivered to-day might, in their opinion, suit the employers; a judgment delivered to-morrow might suit the employes, and both sides are equally entitled to have preserved the right which enables them to confine the actions of Courts with inferior jurisdiction to the limits that are placed upon them. The provision in this Bill to remove the power to grant a prohibition is, as the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition points out, an attempt to leave the entire control of the industrial affairs of Australia., in the hands of one person. Such a proposal is impracticable, and must be fraught with danger. This Parliament is not the only body under the Constitution interested in this matter. The High Court has' to preserve the balance as between the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth and the States, under the terms of the Constitution, are equally interested. The Constitution declares that the High Court shall have jurisdiction in all matters in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. That is its original jurisdiction under section 75 of the Constitution. What power have we in this Parliament to alter the terms of the Constitution so as to take away the original jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of judicial officers? It has been decided by the High Court that the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is a! judicial officer, and that under the original jurisdiction conferred upon it by section 75 of the Constitution, the High Court has power to keep and control any judicial officer of the Commonwealth within the confines of his own jurisdiction. I would refer honorable members to the case of <inline font-style="italic">Rex v. the Commonwealth ex -parte Whybrow,</inline> 2,  C.L.R., in which the Chief Justice made the position perfectly clear.

                        <para>It cannot be denied that the Judge of the Arbitration Court is an officer of the Commonwealth, or that his functions are judicial._ In my opinion, therefore, this Court has original jurisdiction, under the Constitution itself, to grant a prohibition against him. If the meaning of the words of section 75 were even ambiguous the necessity of such a controlling power existing somewhere is so apparent that I should think that the ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the power. </para>

                    <para class="block">There are three ways in which a writ of prohibition may be authorized. In the first place, this Parliament may regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. Section 73 of the Constitution, which gives the High Court power, subject to such regulations as the Parliament may prescribe, to hear and determine appeals. Then, again, under section 76 the Parliament is given power to confer on the High Court original jurisdiction in any matter arising under laws made by the Parliament or arising under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation. Those are matters in respect of which the power to issue a writ of prohibition may be affected legislatively. But there is also a third power to issue  a writ of prohibition against a judicial officer, and that is under the original jurisdiction vested in the High Court, not by Parliament but by the Constitution itself under section 75. What power have we under the Constitution to take that away ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor, in the same case, in the course of his judgment said - </para>

                        <para>The Constitution itself creates the High Court, and, by section 73, expressly invests it with certain appellate jurisdiction. But all the judicial powers of the Commonwealth is not disposed of by that section. The judicial power which section 71 declares should be vested in the High Court is the supreme judicial power of the Commonwealth, and it must necessarily include the power to keep inferior Courts of the federal judicial system from exceeding their jurisdiction. That power is in its nature original, not appellate ; but it may be conferred in either form, and it has, in my opinion, been conferred as original jurisdiction in sub-section <inline font-style="italic">(v)</inline> of section 75. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It is for that reason I appeal to the Attorney-General to seriously consider this matter, because I do not desire to see people sent unnecessarily before the High Court. My view appears to be sustained by the judgments to which I have referred, but it is for the Attorney-General to consider these points. If he, as the Chief Law Officer of the Crown, thinks there is nothing in them, he will act accordingly. The cases, however, are exceedingly strong, and the dicta are plain. It seems common sense to say that so far as the States are concerned the Commonwealth shall not have power to appoint one judicial officer with power to decide questions of his own jurisdiction. </para>

                            <para>- No. If, for instance, we appointed an Inter-State Commission, we could only give it power to deal with industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. We could not empower it to be the sole interpreter of the Constitution. That is a power conferred upon the High Court. This proposal relates to part of the original jurisdiction of the High Court. As the Chief Justice said, the High Court can issue a writ of prohibition against a judicial officer to keep him within his jurisdiction. The power to issue a writ of prohibition, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor pointed out, concerns, not only the Commonwealth, but the States. We are working under a Federal Constitution, " and the High Court has to have regard to the powers; of the States as well as to the powers of the Commonwealth. Holding as it does the balance of power, it has to interpret the Constitution fairly between the Commonwealth and the States. Honorable members must realize the intention of this clause. In the Broken Hill case the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, acting, as he thought, within his powers, exceeded his jurisdiction. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to deal, not with details, but with the broad principles involved. The  President  of the Court exceeded his jurisdiction, and the High Court held that it had power to keep him within his jurisdiction, as laid down by Parliament. From the stand-point of common sense and fairness, it must be conceded that there ought to be some power in the High Court to confine each Court to its own appropriate sphere of action. Without such a power we should have, as the Chief Justice said, a Court of practically unlimited jurisdiction. That would be the position under this clause. As the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition points out, the idea is to vest in one judicial officer the power to deal with all the industries of the Commonwealth. </para>

The Government are seeking to take away the limitation of the power of a judicial officer and to give, him complete and uncontrolled authority. That is the objection.

                            <para>- I am simply pointing out that there are two aspects to be regarded. The first concerns the justice or merits of the action, and the second the constitutionality of  taking  it even if it is just. The intention of extending the powers of the Court in this way is obvious. Under section 21 the certificate of the Registrar is to be <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence, first that a dispute exists, and then that it is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of one State. But those are the very things that go to make up jurisdiction. Before a dispute can come within the jurisdiction of the Court to settle within the meaning of the Constitution it must be a dispute extending beyond the limits of one State. </para>

Where these possibilities of error arise, and there is only one form of appeal, we should try to preserve that appeal in order to keep the Court within its jurisdiction.

Another section which shews how far the Bill goes is  38B,  which provides that, in making an award or order, the Court shall not be restricted to the specific relief claimed by the parties to the industrial dispute, or to the demands made by the parties in the course of the dispute, but may include in the award or order any matter or thing which the Court thinks necessary or expedient for the purpose of preventing or settling the dispute. What does this include? It is couched in the widest possible language. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is not, and that is why it is dangerous to extend it in this way without preserving the control over the jurisdiction. As a rule, persons go to a Court knowing the issues they have to meet. That is fair and just. This goes much further. The demands need not be part of the dispute or arise during the dispute, and the Judge is to have power to include in his award something which perhaps was never contemplated by the parties. </para>

                    <para>The first difficulty that faces me is as to the meaning of the Act. The words are few, and at first sight plain of meaning; but, in applying the words, one finds that the Legislature has not indicated ' what it means by " fair and reasonable " - what is the model or criterion by which fairness and reasonableness are to be determined. It is to be regretted that the Legislature has not given a definition of the words. It is the function of the Legislature, not of the </para>
                    <para>Judiciary, to ' deal with social and economic problems; it is for the Judiciary to apply, and, when necessary, to interpret the enactments of the Legislature.- But here, this whole controversial problem, with its grave social and economic bearings, has been committed to a Judge, who is not, at least directly, responsible, and who ought not to be responsive to public opinion. Even if the delegation of duty should be successful in this case, it by no means follows that it will be so hereafter. I do not protest against the difficulty of the problem, but against the confusion of functions - against the failure to define, the shunting of Legislative responsibility. It would be almost as reasonable to tell a Court to do what is "right" .with regard to real estate, and yet lay down no laws or principles for its guidance. </para>
                    <para>In the course of the long discussion of this case, I have become convinced that the  President  of this Court is put in a false position. The strength of the Judiciary in the public confidence is largely owing to the fact that the Judge has not to devise great principles of action as between great classes, or to lay down what is fair and reasonable as between contending interests in the community; but has to carry out mandates of the Legislature, evolved out of the conflict of public opinion after debate in Parliament. I venture to think that it will not be found wise thus to bring the Judicial Department within the range of political fire. </para>

                            <para>- In what he says the Judge is quite right. Under the Constitution the intention was that all these great industrial conflicts- which extend beyond the limits of one State should be left to the Commonwealth jurisdiction, with power for us to legislate to provide means for their prevention or settlement. That contemplated an industrial dispute or the possibility of it, with a Judge coming in judicially and determining the particular conflict between, the parties. But the full effect of this Bill will be to eliminate the judicial element from it. In the particular provision to which I am referring there is an attempt to give the Judge jurisdiction over something which is not in dispute. The Government in attempting to extend the power of the Court in every possible way, without rules for its guidance, are doing exactly what the Judge protested against. They are making the Court less and less judicial and making it more and more legislative, and more and more regulative of all the industries over the whole length and breadth of the continent. In doing this the Government are inviting failure, courting defeat, and doing what is fraught with danger to the whole community. That is the tendency of the measure. It is the danger against which' the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition protests. The aim and intention of the Government is apparently to give the Court the fullest and widest powers. I shall deal with the second' point of the extension of the area by this legislation. By extending that area the Government are again taking more and. more of the judicial character out of the tribunal and making it more and more legislative and regulative. The scheme of the Act. as it at present stands could not be better stated than it was by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs in his judgment in the engine-drivers' case.

                        <para>The keynote of the Act is the prevention or the quelling of industrial strife which threatens or produces an interruption of industrial operations by which the wants of the community are satisfied. The public welfare is always the end in view. If the industrial operations necessary, for instance, to produce or distribute the mean* of satisfying the requirements, of the people of Australia, are in fact, or are likely to be, interrupted by a dispute between those who are co-operators in those industrial operations- that is, both employers and employes - then that dispute - with a certain qualification which is material - is in obedience to the Statute to be prevented or settled. </para>

The object of controlling industries is because industries supply and distribute to the public, and any stoppage of their operations causes the public to suffer. We therefore require power to intervene and prevent or ' settle those large disputes in industries. I do not say that the Government have not the power to put in a clause regulating organizations according to handicrafts. It is possible, from the statements of the Judge, that they have that power.

                            <para>- That may be so; but the honorable member for Dalley will admit that evidently a view contrary to his own is held among the workers. The honorable member for Cook pointed out that, from the workers' point of view, there are disadvantages in trying to organize on a purely crafts basis. My contention is that by legislating, as this Bill does, to allow handicrafts to be a basis for organization, we are extending the power of the Court indefinitely, and by every extension of power we are adding to the burden of the Court, increasing the number of cases to be decided, and making it less and less judicial and more and more regulative. Under the guise of a judicial power to be exercised for the purpose of settling industrial disputes, the Government are trying to accomplish a legislative power which is not intended by the Constitution. So surely as they strain it from its original purpose, so surely will they find in practice and experience that they will defeat their own ends. At the present time the Court deals only with industries. If a dispute extending beyond a State arises in an industry, it can give a judicial decision to settle it. Disputes in industries like the pastoral and shipping industries, whose operations extend over the Commonwealth, and are in their nature inter- State, come fairly within the jurisdiction of the Court. It was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, as can be gathered by reading the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> and others, that the Commonwealth should attempt to regulate isolated indus' tires whose operations were confined wholly to any one State. That, however, is attempted by the amendment. The scheme of the existing arbitration legislation is for the furtherance of collective bargaining, in which all unionists believe. That means that you must have two parties, each possessing a common interest, the employers in an industry organ'ized on the one side, and the employes on the other. You cannot have collective bar' gaining when, on the one side, there is the organization of all the workers in a craft, and, on the other, a number of employers in different industries possessing no community of interest. For collective bargaining you must have two organizations1, each representing one side of an industry. The Bill will enable collective bargaining to be set aside. That, if not its purpose, will be its effect. There may be an organization of employes of whom, say, there are fifty in a Queensland industry, fifty others in a New South Wales industry of another character, and fifty others in a Victorian industry of a different kind. Such an organization could create a dispute with the employers of the three industries concerned,' which may have nothing in common, and are carrying on operations in different States. </para>

                            <para>- Under the Bill all that is necessary to create an inter- State dispute is to have an organization of employes working in more than one State in separate industries. Should such a dispute as I have mentioned arise with the several employers in the respective States, the presiding Judge would have to investigate the conditions of three industries in the three separate States. At the same time each State has full legislative power to deal with those industries, and to give such relief as its citizens may consider necessary.  What  dc we find in connexion with the engine-drivers' case, which is alleged to be the reason for the introduction of the Bill? There could be no collective bargaining in that case, because, although there might be a community of interest among the engine-drivers, there could, in the nature of things, be no community of interest amongst the 177 defendants. The defendants in that  case comprised a Tasmanian smelting company, the Mayor and citizens of the city of Melbourne, the Chief Commissioner of the South Australian railways, Allen Taylor and Co. Limited, Sydney, a Queensland sugar company, the Queensland National Bank, a rubber company, a firm of grocers, the Zeehan Mines Limited, and many other firms and corporations operating in different parts of Australia. If the Judge of the Arbitration Court is to comply with the provisions of the Bill, he must determine  conditions in every industry throughout Australia which comes before him. The honorable member for Maribyrnong last night interjected that there is always a lawyer to conduct the case on one side. But does the Judge give his decisions in accordance with the representations of the lawyer who appears before him? To obtain a fair and equitable settlement, there must be a thorough investigation of all the facts, requiring evidence as to the conditions obtaining in each industry in each State. To ascertain the conditions of a Queensland industry, there must be an examination on the spot, to find out the cost of living, the prices of commodities, and so on. Similar investigations must be conducted in all the other States. Could 177 individual defendants, as in the enginedrivers' case obtain a thorough investigation of conditions in all their industries? Could the Judge find time to make himself fully acquainted with the conditions of the sugar industry in Queensland, of tin-mining in Tasmania, railway management in South Australia, and harbor works at Sydney ? </para>

                            <para>- That was merely a matter of dropping letters into the post-box. I am speaking of the difficulties of hearing a case in which the organization is by crafts and not by industries. In a case such as the engine-drivers, you have men banded together on the one side, and on the other a large number of employers scattered all over Australia, with nothing in common. I appreciate the excellent work which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has done. We have put on him an almost superhuman task. He has exercised great patience and ability, and has shown the strongest desire to do right between man and man. But we must realize that certain things are impracticable. If we are to have organization by crafts, a new system for settling disputes will be needed. The State tribunals should be called in to assist. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but in that dispute only one industry was concerned, and there was a community of interest on both sides. In the engine-drivers' case there is no community of interest among the employers, but to arrive at a complete and adequate decision the affairs of 177 different industries operating all over Australia had to be investigated. I would point out to honorable members that in the Excise Act, passed to protect the labour employed in a protected industry, the Judge was required to investigate the conditions of the industry, not of the crafts concerned. In the Harvester case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins dealt with the conditions of the harvester industry, and fixed what he considered reasonable rates for the various classes of workmen employed. To deal with economic facts other than as they affect particular industries raises many difficulties. If, in every case, the Judge had to deal with the conditions of all the industries in which the members of a craft were employed, he would have an impossible task to perform. </para>

                            <para>- It is one thing to speak for 30,000 persons, and another to regulate the conditions of all the industries of Australia. If the Government try to carry out the scheme they have in view they will possibly find it impracticable. They are seeking to confer legislative and regulative powers instead of judicial powers ; and if that be done, in view of the constant application that will be made to review awards, it will lead to endless trouble, and, in the end, the whole scheme will be fraught with danger to the community. </para>

                        <para>-- The Opposition are exceedingly kind to the Government in their desire to prevent mistakes being made in this legislation. Personally, however, I have a certain measure of doubt as to the honesty of intention on the part of honorable members opposite, because, if all the evils foretold must take place, I am inclined to think they would allow the Bill to pass just in order to show how inefficient the Government are. The honorable member for Darling Downs has placed before us in a concrete and clear way that which was so blurred in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition as to require much searching and unravelling, with the conviction that, when we thought we had arrived at that gentleman's meaning, we should be told that it was not what he intended to convey. The honorable member for Darling Downs complains because opportunities are not presented for involving the parties concerned in the expenditure of money for the purpose of appealing from the decision of one man to the decision of another man. Lawyers seem to think that justice is dispensed according to the number of Courts to which appeal is made - that justice depends on employing trained minds to mystify the minds of Judges and all concerned by mere word spinning. If no greater objections can be raised to the Bill than those which we have already heard, I must say that I feel much warmer to the measure than I did. It was always intended that there should be a Court of a special kind, guided by equity and good conscience, seeing that the matters to come before it are the most difficult that call for solution. Further, it was intended that the decision of the Court 'should settle disputes, and that the awards made must be observed under penalty. In the" case of the New South Wales Act, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> of that State, thought, and Parliament thought, that he had successfully provided against appeals; and those who refer to that Act now as a failure overlook the fact that it never had a chance. Its decisions were upset on appeal, and the object of Parliament thus defeated. Members of the Opposition who voted for the present Commonwealth Act intended that the decision of the Court should be final. But appeals to the High Court have rendered the legislation less workable, and limited the power of the Judge to dispense that economic justice which the honorable member for Darling Downs says he desires. That honorable member, however, is not agreeable to amend the law, as far as possible within the Constitution, in order to arrive at that justice, and urges that there should be reserved the power of appeal on a. mere technicality. </para>

Although the award given by the Court might settle a dispute and satisfy both parties, the honorable member desires that there may be appeals on the question of jurisdiction, with the result that the award may be set aside on a technicality. In ordinary litigation there are appeals on the merits of a case, but as to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court that is not so. </para>

                            <para>- I think that if we did the right thing, we would now bar lawyers from this Court. We do not secure economic justice if we provide means of upsetting the decisions, not on questions of fact, but on questions of jurisdiction. I do not agree that this is altogether a one-man judgment, but, even supposing it. is, how is the case altered by referring the decision to another man? The High Court consists of five Judges, and, if there are two on each side, the decision is left to one man. </para>

                            <para>- One man, however, settles the question. It is true that there is 'only a limited number of men with the necessary qualifications to act as a Judge of  the Conciliation and Arbitration Court ; but when we have selected the best, I am prepared to leave the final decision in his hands. As a layman, it appears to me that the methods of the Court must differ materially from those of ordinary Courts. Complaint is made that the Act is not clear, but when we provided that the Judge should satisfy himself in equity and good conscience that seemed to us to be sufficient. This is a special Court with a new procedure, or, if it is not such a Court, it will fail in its purpose. From the Leader of the Opposition downwards - or perhaps it ought to be upwards, seeing that we have got some clear idea of their contention from subsequent speakers - honorable members opposite evidently desire to prevent this Bill passing. The Leader of the "Opposition said that the original Act is a. good one, and on the right track. But it has been found ineffective, not because of lack of foresight, perhaps, but in the light of experience. Additional powers are necessary to make it more workable; and we ought to have the support of those who declare themselves in favour of economic justice. We find, however, that honorable members opposite, who loudly proclaim themselves in favour of conciliation and arbitration, are going to vote against the Bill, basing their objection mainly on one clause. There are honorable members, like the honorable member for Parkes and the honorable member for Fawkner, who prefer Wages Boards; but even these, although they have done much good work, usually represent the decision of one man. It was quite unnecessary on the part of the honorable member for Wimmera to remind the Prime Minister that Wages Boards could not deal with Commonwealth affairs. </para>

                    <para class="block">Wages Board system. Wages Boards have undoubtedly done good, and are better than nothing at all to regulate the conditions of labour ; but the drawback is that the representatives of the workers upon them are often in the employ of the very men whom they have to meet upon them. Wages Boards have never been anything more than Boards of Conciliation. Sometimes when a Board is appointed, the representatives of one of the parties refuse to meet, and the decision of the Board is held up month after month. Everything depends upon the willingness of the parties to meet and settle their disputes, and where the parties to a dispute are willing to meet to settle their differences neither a Wages Boa,rd nor any like body is necessary. Sometimes the one side refuses to appoint representatives on a Wages Board, and a selection has to be made by the Government. Then the representatives appointed in this way refuse occasionally to meet, and more trouble arises. Delegates have in some cases lost their positions as the result of putting up a fight for the workers; Men have been boycotted and discharged from their employment because of their actions as members of Wages Boards. The representatives of the men open their mouths at the risk of great sacrifice and loss. The Wages Board system stands condemned. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is. I said in my book that the Wages Board system had done good work, and that any system which would bring the two parties together was far better than a policy under which they would be allowed .to remain apart. The Arbitration Court is much better than the Wages Board system, because the  President  of the Court has power to compel the two parties to a dispute to come together. In Great .Britain, the Board of Conciliation, acting under the Board of Trade, has settled many disputes, and has done good work, yet troubles have arisen in connexion with it. The Board made an award in regard te the railway employes, and breaches of that award by the railway managers led to the recent great strike in England. The men complained constantly of those breaches, but the railway managers refused to meet them to settle the points in dispute. Finally, the railway employes, being unable to submit for all time to this sort of treatment, stopped the wheels from going round. In that way public attention was directed to their position, the people became alarmed, and the employers were practically coerced into meeting representatives of the men, with the result that the dispute was settled. The people are finding out that that system of conciliation is a failure. We have more class feeling and bitterness in Australia than exists in most countries, and nothing but a tribunal with the power of a Supreme Court to compel the parties to a dispute to appear before it will enable us to secure anything like industrial peace. The power of the Court must be practically unlimited. Under the Constitution as it stands our Conciliation and Arbitration Court has but a very restricted power, and the Opposition recently put up a successful fight against an attempt to extend that power. </para>

                            <para>- Our desire was that the power of the Court should Be complete, for we felt that anything less would be unsatisfactory. The voluntary conciliation, to which the honorable member for Parkes has referred, was resorted to when there existed nothing like the bitterness that prevails to-day. The social problem is becoming more and more intensified. There is increasing intelligence on the part of the masses and increasing discontent. People are no longer willing to be, practically, slaves, both mentally and physically. They are no longer content to do just what they are told. The day when such a condition of affairs was possible has gone, and hence we require very efficient Courts to mete out justice. Even with a Court possessing the fullest power, we should not be entirely free from industrial disturbances, because in the very nature of things changes and difficulties must occur. I cannot understand the attitude of honorable members opposite who claim that the Act should stand as it is, although experience has shown that it needs to be amended. The original New Zealand Act has been followed by a series of amending measures; it has been improved as experience has shown improvement to be necessary. The New Zealand Parliament has sovereign power to deal with the whole matter, and it is certainly our duty to exercise to the full what power we have to improve the existing law. If the Opposition can point in Committee to any serious defect in the Bill, I am sure that the Government will be prepared to remedy it. But it is absurd for the Opposition to submit, as they have done, an amendment turning down the Bill altogether, on the ground that its passage would mean handing over to one individual the control of the conditions of all industry in Australia. The  President  of the Court has not a sufficiently wide jurisdiction, and we must take an early opportunity to give him the fullest jurisdiction with which we can vest him to determine disputes. Unless we do so, we cannot hope for the settlement of industrial troubles. The honorable member for Parkes, who spoke at length on this question, is generally amusing, but he expressed surprise at the laughter in which we indulged during the course of his speech. Those who are actively connected with organizations cannot help laughing when they hear the honorable member, who professes to have followed this question closely, asserting that he has never heard of members of a union meeting before going out on strike. The mere fact that the holding of such a meeting is not announced in the press is no proof that it is not held. Honorable members have two or three meals a day, but no publicity is drawn to the fact. Certain things take place in the ordinary course of events, and no one expects to see any public reference to them. How could men determine to go out on strike without holding a meeting to dis-cuss the matter? Occasions have occurred on which men have " downed tools " on account of some immediate trouble, but in such cases their action would have been the same even if a preliminary meeting had been held. Trade union rules with regard to strikes and attempted strikes are very strict. Union leaders in both the Old World and the New have always looked upon a strike as the last resort. </para>

                            <para>- No; the honorable member must not seek for knowledge in this respect from the newspapers. Such a statement is made only by those who do not take the trouble to get the inside knowledge. Honorable members should look into the facts for themselves. It is notorious that Labour leaders are strongly opposed to strikes, and advise recourse to them only in the last resort. But, after all, I do not know why we should expect absolute perfection in humanity. Neither the employers nor the employes are perfect ; they are human beings and all are very much alike. The honorable member for Parkes complained that he never heard of a Labour man denouncing a strike. Every one who has looked into this subject with a desire to ascertain the true facts, knows, however, that Labour men have been urging the workers for years to organize, and to appeal to the Legislatures and to the Courts that have been provided by the Parliaments of those countries in which they have voting power. We have appealed to them again and again not to go on strike, but to obtain a decision of the Court and to stand by it. The newspapers, however, do not report such appeals on our part. It would be useless to search the daily press at the present time for any statement favorable to Labour men. Evidence as to these matters cannot be taken from such sources, but the fact remains that persistent effort has been made by Labour leaders to induce men to appeal to the Legislatures and the Courts of their country. We want efficiency in the Court and complete power on the part of the Court to deal with the questions submitted to it. It is a serious thing to ask trade unions to give up that which has been their only weapon - the power to suspend work - unless we can guarantee them an efficient Court capable of settling their difficulties. If honorable members opposite desire the imposition of a severe penalty on any body of men who violate the law by going out on strike, they must join with us in our attempt to make the Court as efficient as possible. If it were not to be made efficient, I should not favour this class of legislation. The workers are going to have a measure of economic justice, but this method of settling disputes will not get rid of all the evils from which the masses are suffering to-day. It touches only the problem of wages, and leaves, untouched the question of what the sovereign will buy. I wish to correct some wrong impressions created by the honorable member for Parkes. The honorable member, who claims to be an economist, says that we cannot go on raising wages without raising the cost of production, and that the cost of production has increased because wages have increased. But as the honorable member for Bourke pointed out, logic of that kind only means that to improve the position of the workers we must reduce their wages again and again until finally they will be able to live for nothing. Every one must recognise the fallacy of such an argument  as  that advanced by the honorable member for Parkes. New machinery and the applied forces of nature are constantly leading: to a reduction in the cost of production. The rise in the cost of living is not due to the cost of labour. I do not deny that if wages are increased the cost of production, must be increased, but the point that we have to consider is to what extent the increase in the cost of production is the result of increased wages. The percentage must: be very small in manufacturing industries. In the building trade, where much work. is done by individual labour, the raising of wages would probably increase the cost of production to the same extent; but in the manufacturing industries production has been immensely cheapened by the introduction of improved machinery. Consequently, although wages have increased the cost of production! has been reduced ; yet side by side with that reduction in the cost of production the cost of living is daily increasing. The Court has no power to deal with that aspect of the question. As a proof of what I say, that economic writer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chiozza</inline> Money, M.P., of England, in an article published in <inline font-style="italic">The Nation,</inline> analyzes the figures of the Board of Trade. He shows that in the fifteen years from  1895  to  1910  there was an increase of wages to the extent of  13.3  per cent. Taking forty-five articles of every day consumption, there was an increase of  19.5  per cent, in the wholesale and  17.9  per cent, in the retail London prices. Surely that is an answer to the contention that it is the rise in the workmen's wages that has caused the increased cost of living. It . is shown also that the average income of the income taxpayer increased during the same period from  .£698  to <inline font-style="italic">£964,</inline> or an increase of  ^266  per income taxpayer, the total aggregate assessment under the income tax increasing by no less than  £402,000,000.  It is in those figures that the explanation of the increased price of goods is to be found. It lies in the profit-taking. Those who are making profits are taking more out of the workers than the sum by which the wages have increased. That exposes the fallacy of the argument of the honorable member for Parkes that wages are the cause of the increased cost of living. There are many other causes that we know of, and which it is perhaps unnecessary to discuss now. One factor is the increased rents. My observation and inquiries in the Old World showed me that rents for workmen's homes are only about half what the rent-taker takes here. I really do not know how the workers at Home keep life in their bodies on the wages that they get. </para>

                            <para>- I have pointed out how the application of machinery, and constant improvements in machinery, have been steadily decreasing the cost of production, and that the cost of living has gone up owing to other causes than wages. _ I admit that in the building trade, for instance, the increase of wages has to be taken to some extent into account ; but in all manufactures machinery has been such a factor in eliminating labour that the question of wages is only a small one. The Tariff Commission put down wages at only about 16 per cent, on an average of the cost of articles. The Conciliation and Arbitration Courts do not touch all these issues; they must be settled in other ways. </para>

                            <para>- He has not yet been able to get all the kilns up to supply the public. It takes the Department all their time to supply the Government's own requirements. When they do begin to supply the public there will be a big fall in the price of bricks outside. The world will go on even if honorable members opposite shut their eyes to the changes that are taking place and the progress that is being made. We must go back to the main issue in this connexion. All these methods of Boards of Conciliation have been a failure, because of the bitterness between the parties. They refused to go before such a Board. What is required is a Court with very big powers to intervene and settle disputes. It cannot possibly have power to settle unless it can settle all the conditions of the industry. If it is to be limited as our Federal Court is limited it will never be very satisfactory. That aspect makes the problem the more serious, because we cannot expect trade unions to be ready to voluntarily surrender their right to strike unless there is an efficient Court to go to. If the conditions cannot be settled properly no man of grit and courage will sit down idly and suffer injustice. Although there have been increases in wages the cost of living has increased in a greater proportion. We have not statistics enough available to show the exact increase of the cost of living in the Commonwealth, but Board of Trade returns in England have shown that wages actually have been falling ; yet when the workers there ask for consideration the employing class will not meet them or make them any concession. Profit taking is going on all the time. Honorable members cannot expect men of our race to stand that sort of thing. They are going to make trouble, and are justified in making it. They would not be men if they did not. What is the use of saying that they ought not to go on strike, or that honorable members on this side do not express their disapproval when strikes take place? </para>

                            <para>- I do not, because they know their own business best all the time. It is always most difficult to get a workman stirred up to stick up for himself and his own rights, to say nothing of inducing him to go to extremes. He is very modest in his demands. We do not want industrial trouble. We have reached a period when society is justified in saying, " You shall not upset the industrial machine." As society becomes more complex and interwoven, every dispute that arises becomes the more dangerous because of the chance of its spreading. I have always been a believer in industrial unionism, with all those connected with one trade united if possible in one organization. I do not say that the same rule can be applied to every industry, but if there is no Court to settle all the conditions, then craft unionism is a drawback. I do not know that the same difficulty would arise if we had an efficient Court to settle the disputes of every section, but it must be remembered that if these things are to be narrowed down to too small organizations the cost of going to the Court becomes a more and more serious factor. It is very costly now to approach the Court even if the lawyers are kept out of it. Strikes were costly, but they were forced on the men. They upset society, and cause big losses ; they were therefore great evils just as war is a great evil. War is a loss to every nation, as has been recently so ably shown by Norman Angel. We said, "We want to stop strikes." We are justified in attempting to stop them, but we also want a Court that is as economic as possible. If appeals are facilitated, and points of law regarding jurisdiction are to be taken and dealt with at length, the cost will be still further increased, and unions will lie unable to take advantage of the Court at all. At the ^  r  e time it is proposed to deprive them of the right of striking, with the result that they will be cornered in such a way that they will become slaves. The small unions are too weak to go to the Court. Some of them have to appeal to other unions for help to get economic justice from a Court. Yet honorable members opposite want to prevent their having a chance to go to the Court, by imposing limitations of all kinds, and having an imperfect Act. </para>

                            <para>- That happens if a union is prevented by the cost from going to the Court. When they do go to the Court there is a risk of having the decision, upset, and so it does not pay them to go. Naturally in those circumstances they will say, " We would do better if we followed the old method." We are all aiming ai securing peace and harmonious working, but we will not get it if we follow the advice of the Opposition. It is a very serious matter for employers and employes alike to have a bad spirit running through the ranks of the workers, but the whole question hinges upon the efficiency of the machinery that Parliament provides for the settlement of disputes. We have not arc efficient Court now. We certainly have an efficient Judge, one of the ablest to be found; but he is limited all the time by the question of jurisdiction. He said; as the honorable member for Darling Downs quoted, that Parliament should legislate. We are proposing to legislate now. I confess that I do not like the idea of craft unionism, but circumstances have greatly changed. We have shifted the battle ground from the strike field to the Law Courts. Instead of spending money on strikes, we shall have to spend it in getting justice from the Court. _ Parliament will not do what is right if it allows the Court to be prevented from giving this justice. There are many remedies which we have power to give, and the Bill is an attempt to provide some of them. If it be found that there is too much work for one Judge to do, we must appoint others. In New South Wales they declared the arbitration law to be a failure, and did not renew it. That, of course, was the employers' cry, but they will have to recognise that the employes will not remain quiet under injustice. Something has been said about the big organization with which I am connected. Its strength has to be counted with. Its members have been satisfied with the awards obtained, and have loyally abided by them, and their organization has enabled them to compel the other side to abide by them. We must make the Court as useful as possible. No one who wishes for industrial peace should oppose an amendment of the law.' </para>

                        <para>. - I assure the honorable member for Darling that there is no difference between members on this side and those of his party in regard to the desire that labour shall receive adequate wages, nor do I think there is a difference of opinion on the point that increase of wages means better results from the workmen. There is, of course, a limit in this as in other matters, and an opposition of opinions in regard to that limit, as well as an apparent opposition due to the fact that we" are not always speaking from the same point of view. The limit of a man's powers may be represented by the number twenty.  His  wages may stimulate his exertion to a degree which should be represented by the number ten, and might be increased to provide a stimulus which would call forth an exertion which should be represented by the number twenty. But no increase would enable him to do a day's work which might be represented by the number thirty, or any number higher than twenty. On this point there is no real difference between the honorable member for Parkes and the honorable member for Darling. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. The honorable member for Darling has shown clearly that during the last thirty or forty years, although wages in England have nominally increased, there has been, not a real increase, but a decrease. I am aware of the facts from the reading of statistics in the Board of Trade report, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chiozza</inline> Money's gloss upon them. Of course, these issues are not relevant to, or at least only remotely connected with, a Bill for altering the machinery of the existing arbitration law. All measures designed to give labour a fairer share in the profits of production must receive consideration. The increase in the cost of building shows that, by methods which are not Socialistic in the ordinary sense of the word, although really so, a re-arrangement of incomes is going on quietly which must lead to a better balanced community. If building costs 50 to 100 per cent, more than it did twenty years ago, I am content, so long as a proportionate increased return, from labour is obtained, and the increased profits do not go into the wrong pocket, which I believe to be, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> an extent, the case now. From figures which' have been furnished to me, I have reason to think that the appreciation! of cost is due only to a small extent to the higher rates of labour. I refer to these matters lest there remain in the minds of honorable members, and of those who read the debates, -the misapprehension that there is any difference between us in regard to the desire that the wholesome revolution commenced some time ago shall not end until society has obtained that approximate balance which is for the general good'. I have great sympathy with the members of the engine-drivers' organization, the cancellation of whose award has, perhaps, precipitated the introduction of this measure. I was in the case up to a certain point, and dropped out because most of the companies which are represented came to an agreement with their men which, in the long run, was made the basis of the award ultimately upset. I realize that the engine-drivers have had difficulties to face because of the non-recognition by State tribunals of craft interests. They have had to fight cases before one tribunal after another, ana have sometimes been blocked by technicalities which the State Parliaments can, and which we cannot, cure. </para>

                            <para>-  Which they will not cure. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN.</inline> - I do not suppose that there is an absence of desire, but there is a limitation on human wisdom and action. I have nothing to say against other politicians who are, perhaps, quite up to our moral level, even if some may think them to be, when they differ from us, not our intellectual equals. Through coming into contact with the engine-drivers, and by hearing what might be called irrelevant issues, I ascertained that they were driven to the Commonwealth Court to get an award which should apply to the whole craft. They could not get State awards applying to all the engine-drivers, firemen, and others connected with their avocation without appealing to many Boards. But it is for the States to improve their legislation rather than for us to pass Statutes which may lead to subsequent heartburning when reviewed by the High Court. A great deal of trouble has been caused because some honorable members consider that the powers given by the Constitution are wider than they really are. They seem to think that by extending the provisions of our Arbitration Act we can remedy the evils to which I have referred. I cannot see why the word "prohibition" has been used, unless for the purposes of a placard. We cannot by giving the Court the right of prohibition exercise powers not given to us by the Constitution, but left to the States. The Attorney-General interjected when the honorable member for Darling Downs wa&gt;&gt; speaking, that what is proposed now is in the Act of  1904.  No. doubt he referred to the use of the word " quash " as connected with prohibition. The employment of that word was challenged by honorable members on this side at the time, and I would remind the honorable gentleman that two wrongs do not make a right. We cannot, in this matter, give the Arbitration Court wider jurisdiction. If we could do so, we should, as the honorable member for Darling Downs pointed out, make one tribunal arbitrary and absolute in regard to the settlement of industrial disputes throughout the Commonwealth. The arbitration law of. New South Wales has been amended, I understand, by the adoption of a principle somewhat similar to that which I am discussing, under which no award, so long as it is an award, can be challenged. But we cannot pass such a provision. If we could, we should enable the Arbitration Court to arrogate to itself what powers it liked. The New South Wales Legislature has power to enact that nothing done by its industrial tribunal shall be challenged anywhere, but if we passed such an enactment it would be tantamount to declaring that the tribunal could decide what powers of the Commonwealth or of the States could conveniently be exercised for the purpose of making an award, and powers would thus be exercised by the Commonwealth which are not given to it by the Constitution. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Carpenters and Joiners</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Haver-field.</inline> 5, <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> the High Court declared in connexion with the unamended New South Wales Arbitration Act that - </para>

                            <para>- That shows the application of my remarks, when even such an intelligent mind as that of the honorable member thinks that the High Court is really usurping our province. If that be the opinion of any member of this House, do not let us leave it open to the general public, who cannot devote much time to these subjects, to say that, when prohibition is declared to be inoperative the Judiciary is blocking the way to our making the industrial laws effective. In an examination of the question of industrial conciliation and arbitration by a writer named Knoop, who, I think, is a German, attention is called to the ineffectiveness in England, America, and Australia, of what we might call the legislative character of some tribunals. He mentions that there are two kinds of industrial disputes - one the proper subject of arbitration, which is our power, and another a proper subject of industrial legislation, which is not our power.

                        <para>It is most important to recognise that there are two classes of labour disputes. The first class arises out of the interpretation of existing contracts.

                            <para>- I think the Opposition as a whole would have done so. However, we are not dealing with that matter now. All the Acts and provisions made in England up to the date of our Constitution were in the direction of judicial arbitration, from the Act of 1824, which was the first great consolidating Act dealing with employers and employed, though the words, which .are now happily abolished, then used were " masters and servants." All these Acts deal with judicial arbitration on the lines of our Arbitration Act as it stands at present, but not on the lines on which it is proposed to amend it. That is, they are Acts attempting to deal with clearly defined industries, and not conglomerated and unrelated industries. I could, if necessary, show this by reference to the Act of 1824, the Act of 1872, and the principal Act, relied on by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Askwith</inline> of the Board of Trade, through whose mediation the solution of so ma.r.m strike difficulties has been brought about in the last ten or fifteen years. It is not altogether right to think that the question of the possibility of making aggregations of employes and industries, or grouping together, as in the engineer's case, unrelated crafts, was raised for the first time in that case. It was raised in the saw-millers' case and the Jumbunna case, but in argument, and was never pushed on to a decision by the High Court. The only power under the English Acts of dealing with future contracts - that is, regulating conditions and wages for the future - was by the consent of both sides, either implied consent through being members of organizations, ' or by consent when a dispute had arisen, and been submitted for consideration by a </para>

                    <para class="block">Board of Trade tribunal. To the extent, then, to which we depart from arbitration, or the judicial determination of something, and endeavour to regulate future wages we are dealing, not with arbitration, but with industrial legislation. I think we can improve our Acts, and will endeavour  to  point out how. I emphasize this point by showing that a great deal of the difference of opinion as to the decisions of the High Court has been caused by an ill-founded assumption in some parts that we have legislative powers in these matters - I was going to say greater legislative powers than our Constitution gives to us. The Arbitration Act provides at present, practically, for compulsory organization on one side, but there is  no  effective provision for organization on the other. I say that  it  is compulsory on one side, because employes cannot submit a dispute at present except through an organization. It may be done by reference from a State  tribunal,  or it may be that, in other ways, there can be held to be an industrial dispute without an organization. We may take it on the whole, however, that a body of men cannot come before the Court except as an organization; and that, on the other side, there is no compulsory  organization.  If we amend the Act in the direction suggested, we can never have that organization. We could not possibly insist by law that the employers must  organize,  even if the Constitution so allowed. In the case of the engineers, for instance, they are employed at Broken Hill in silver-mining, in smelting at Port Pirie,  in  coal-mining, in electrical works, and in twenty-three or twenty-four other categories ; and we could not insist that they must organize, even if we had power to so legislate. And we diminish the stimulus to voluntary organization if we provide that the basis for the future of an industry, and, consequently, of the organization, is to be unrelated industries or trades. If we confine the interpretation of the word "industry" as it is interpreted by the High Court - that is, to one definite line of production, or service,- or to industries that are related in general interests, so that there may be some nexus between employers as well as some nexus between the men, and some mutual interest between employers and employed - we may induce them to organize"; and I have no objection personally to force an organization on the other side. But would that be expedient? Some would think - referring again to the question of a liberal interpretation - that such a Trade as the bootmakers was not within the purview of the Constitution. Clearly,  sailors connected with Inter-State shipping are, because there is no power to make an industrial award applicable, except in the Federal Parliament. If we take the bootmakers, however, it might be said that all they demand could be achieved by the legislation of the States. But there might be one set of laws in one State, and another set in another State; and the consequence would be that Inter-State competition would be on an unfair basis. That is one of the points that the present Opposition, when in power, proposed to deal with. It was proposed that an InterState Commission should be _ established, with general power to deal with these industrial matters as well as with unemployment, and should be so constituted as, on reference from a State tribunal, to be able to reconcile disparities that make against equality of competition. </para>

                            <para>- The present system provides for organization on one side, and practically makes it compulsory, since otherwise the Act could not be availed of by the employes. But it has the defect of offering no effective inducement or compulsion for organization on the side of the employers. If both were organized in relation to a defined industry, or, in other words, a homogeneous line of production, such as gold or silver mining, then we could get in arbitration - I do not know that we could get it under the Act, or under our legislative power - but we could get in arbitration something approaching a common rule. All the members of the organizations on both sides - all the employers connected with that clean cut industry could be bound, as members of the organization, and all the employes connected with the industry might also be compelled, if we wished to make arbitration effective, to organize. When we turn to the bootmakers' case, we find that the decisions are not altogether satisfactory in their scope, although they are so far as the law is concerned. We can bind the employes to the extent only to which they are members of an organization, and we very properly bind them under arbitration, although we really are, in effect, framing, as regards that organization, confined at present to a definite industry, a legislative rule. By joining the organizations, either at the time of the dispute, or subsequently, the members of those organizations voluntarily accept the award that is applied to them. "So that, although you are within the scope of the organization, by binding its members, getting a rule applicable to members, such as you would get under the State determination Boards, you can regard that as arbitration. If you compelled the employers in an industry to amalgamate for the purpose only of settling disputes in that industry, the effect would be also to bind all the employers connected with that industry. That would be the full limits to which you could apply any industrial rule in arbitration. I am pointing out the limits of our power, even if the Constitution were amended, to deal with arbitration matters in Australia. I am only at present suggesting a possible solution of some of the difficulties, and I do not want it to be assumed that I am advocating, on behalf of others, at all events, an amendment of the Constitution in that direction. Under this Bill, as I shall show by reference to a judgment of the High Court, we are destroying the incentive that exists at present towards organization, upon that basis, by extending the definition of " industry " to the lengths proposed. Is this consistent with arbitration? I find that, in England'^ in  1903,  there took place a meeting of trade unions at which a resolution was tabled in favour of the organization of both employers and employes in specific industries on the basis I have mentioned. As there was no statutory Court in existence, it was proposed that both sides should elect representatives to constitute a Court, and that the body thus constituted should have as its President a Justice of one of the Divisional Courts in England. That was the resolution tabled, and it shows, at all events, that a fairly large section of the Labour party in the Old Country were working towards arbitration on the lines which I suggest might be possible if we confined our power to regulate industrial matters through arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; because the Congress was opposed to compulsion of any sort. Trade unionists in England think that they are getting on better under the existing principle of voluntary arbitration than they would do under such an Act as ours. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knoop,</inline> in the book to which I have referred, points to the danger of bringing compulsion to bear on organizations which are- attaining very good ends under the voluntary system. Grouping does take place for voluntary arbitration on something after these lines. In 1901-2, there were 848 employers' associations, and 1,236 trade unions for the purpose of arbitration on those lines. Any award come to through their voluntary Boards was binding on every employer as well as every employe in the industry, who was a member of the association or trade union respectively, and they had a fairly effective means of inducing employers and employes to become members of those organizations. Therefore, there is some experience to justify the suggestion I am now putting before honorable members. I come now to the question of what is the constitutional power. Let us get at it bit by bit by a reference in the first place to the Jumbunna case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, in that case, said - </para>

What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs clearly and precisely points out in this judgment is that it is neither the narrower dispute between a particular employer and his employes, nor the wider one which would make the trouble practically an industrial war. I would ask the Government to carefully note what I might call the <inline font-style="italic">obiter dicta</inline> of the Justices on the constitutional power. Up to the present, we have been deciding whether certain provisions in the Act are within the Constitution. But, as there are <inline font-style="italic">obiter dicta</inline> of the Judges as to the scope of the constitutional power, we must be careful that we are not imperilling the validity of the Act of 1904 itself by dragging in provisions that are not necessarily matters incidental to arbitration. </para>

In order, then, to make it efficacious, and, without doubt, constitutional, you must confine your organization, for the purpose of arbitration, to some specific industry or line of manufacture, production, or service. This Bill does not do that. T shall show what it does attempt to do by a quotation from a judgment of the High Court as to what the Court itself could not do under the Act, as it stands, and, by inference, under the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with what the Court cannot do under the Constitution, and that is the- real point. Let us look at the Engine-drivers case. The Chief Justice, in referring to the scheme of the Act, pointed out that it assumes that the employers concerned in an industrial dispute have a substantial solidity of interest - which would be impossible under the grouping of industries proposed by this amendment - already existing antecedent to, and independent of. the dispute. That is to say, a mere dragging of them into a dispute does not constitute a solidity of interests. The Chief Justice went on to say - </para>

                        <para>I am aware that attempts have been made to turn the Act into a scheme for effecting this purpose. But, as I have said in previous cases, the Arbitration Court has no legislative authority ; its functions are to settle actual disputes between actual employers, or groups of employers, on the one hand and employe's on the other, and then only when the dispute extends beyond one State. Nor, in my opinion, was the Act, any more than the provision in section 51 (xxxv.) of the Constitution, designed to facilitate the manufacture of disputes for the purpose of bringing them before a Federal tribunal. On the contrary, it was designed, however it has been sought to be applied, to promote industrial peace. </para>

                    <para>I ask honorable members opposite to ponder those words in connexion with the proposed amendment of the Act, and see whether I am not justified in suggesting the possibility of the whole of their legislation being imperilled  by  the introduction of sweeping provisions as regards the principle of the Act of  1904.  If the High Court determines that these amendments are invalid, it may affect the whole of this legislation, even though the alteration is only brought in by incorporation. </para>

Although up to the present that principle has applied only to a single Act, I see no reason why it would not apply through the subsequent incorporation in an amending measure like this of provisions which are <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Therefore, by passing this Bill the whole of our arbitration legislation might be invalidated. </para>

                            <para>- They propose nothing of the kind. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition is tabled so that the effect of moving " That the Bill be read this day six months" would not follow if it were carried. It was also tabled because what it draws attention to could not have been expressed in any criticism of the clauses in the Bill. It has the object and effect of pointing out something that may be deduced from the provisions of the Bill in a way that will not block the Bill. </para>

                    <para>Mfr. GLYNN. - I said so at  the beginning, but I am afraid that the methods adopted may be shortsighted. By introducing matters which are not arbitration, the Government may defeat the object which they could have attained by other amendments. The Opposition have been fair. Had we tabled a motion that would defeat the Bill for the session, we might fairly have been charged with blocking an attempt to modify a defect, to some acknowledged extent, in the Act. But if the amendment now before the House is carried the Bill can be gone on with next day. We are therefore entitled to claim that we have not been unfair to the Government in the matter. There is an incidental reference in the Jumbunna case to the constitutional power, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs saying </para>

                    <para class="block">Let us see what is meant by industry and arbitration in England. I looked last night into the final report of the Royal Commission on Labour issued in 1894. It contains, I think, the most exhaustive examination of the basis of organization, the character and scope of industrial disputes, that is open for the research of honorable members. Remembering that this amendment of the Act proposes to define an aggregation of employes in a number of unrelated industries, as an industry, let us see whether that would be an " industry " within the meaning that labour or capital assigns to the word in connexion with industrial disputes at Home. In the final report of the Royal Commission on Labour, the term " trade union " is employed in the usual sense as meaning an association of workmen. In other words, the union is an association of men in a trade or industry. In the Act, as it stands, that is the sense in which the association of employes is regarded. Under section 55 it is an association of employes in an industry,, and, therefore, the association of employes itself is not the industry, but the amendment proposes to define an association of the men as an industry itself. </para>

                            <para>- Again, the question put <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Attorney-General is too vague. It is within the industrial disputes power as an ancillary power. We could have craft organization for some purposes ; but it must be an organization based upon an association in an industry. The moment we go outside of that, as we are doing by the proposed amendment of the definition, we may be going outside the Constitution. In England the association of the men is not regarded as an industry, but is regarded as a trade union - that is, a union in a trade or industry. Hence we find it stated in that report - </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, the employers, as well as the employes, are in the industry. But if, in the sense now sought to be put upon the word, we can define the men as an industry, it certainly does not fit in with the sense in which the word is used in England. The report refers, also, to demarcation disputes, such as those where, in a trade like shipbuilding, organized bodies of workmen are at issue. Here, may I ask : What is the industry of unskilled labour ? Is not that a test ? Can a collection of unskilled labour be defined under the Constitution as an industry ? What industry can unskilled labour constitute? As we understand it, it is labour which may be applied practically to any industry. The Bill, under the word " vocation " proposes to define a grouping of men of that kind as an industry. If it is to be brought under this definition, it must be because it can be defined as an industry under the Constitution. Again, it is said that -  the essence of most disputes between employers and employes is, of course, the shares into which the receipts of their undertakings shall be' divided. </para>

                            <para>- It is difficult for the people to study thoroughly an instrument of government, and to say what powers are expressed and what may be logically deduced from its provisions. But the people had a broad idea of the meaning of the Constitution, and understood that the States were not giving up the whole of their industrial powers under the guise of allowing the Commonwealth to provide for arbitration. It is these general understandings that cause the success or failure of particular propositions. With a popular referendum there is never an understanding of details, even though honorable members may grasp them. When the subject of industrial disputes was discussed by the Convention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> proposed to add the sub-clause - </para>

                    <para>That was in effect, if not in expression, one of the proposed amendments rejected by the people a,t the last referendum. I am not using that objection as conclusive in one way or another. I refer to it simply to show that the framers of the Constitution thought that the words gave over the industrial power to the Commonwealth to a very large extent. That was the reading put on them by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> an authority on the matter, not only because of his reputation as a lawyer, but because of his special knowledge of arbitration subjects, he having then in contemplation the introduction of arbitration legislation into the New South Wales Parliament. Referring to the scope of the amendment, he said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I rose rather to call attention to another aspect of the case. If the effect of the amendment is really to provide for the possible establishment of a Federal Court of Conciliation, I am at one with the object, but the essential part of the language used in the amendment - I am not criticising casual expressions - indicates a much wider object, which would turn this power into a weapon of very great danger. It would, I think, deprive those concerned in these industrial disputes, whether as masters or  employes,  of one of their greatest safeguards. There is no matter which the industrial population of Australia would more desire to confine &gt;to the local Parliaments, where they can make their influence upon us felt, than matters affecting industrial disputes. To give the Federal Parliament power to make laws affecting industrial disputes gives them authority to  regulate  by penalties every detail of the industrial life of every trade in the Colonies. </para>

                    <para class="block">He, in fact, said that, as drafted, the amendment was not arbitration, that it gave powers which it was inexpedient to hand over to the Commonwealth; powers which the people only recently refused to give. The result was that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> was amended, and the words - "Conciliation and arbitration" were added, at the instance of, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline> What we have is, I believe, in intention as well as in expression, the arbitration power, with the limits mentioned in the quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knoop's</inline> work. The honorable member for Darling Downs has raised points of expediency, as well as of law. For instance, a dispute might be got up by any unassociated body of employes. Whether the dispute were within the meaning of the Constitution or not, they could go before the Registrar, and ask for a certificate. All that can be got at present is the certificate that the dispute seems to extend beyond the limits of one State, but under the Bill the certificate will be that there is a dispute, and that it extends beyond the limits of one State. Then, when they go into Court, they will not have to prove the existence of a dispute, the onus being thrown on the employers of proving that a dispute does not exist. I ask whether the Registrar can so sift the evidence presented to him as to be able to give that certificate. The Bill enables him to decide judicially that there is <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of the existence of a dispute, the merits of which should be dealt with by the Court. The amendments of the Constitution suggested by the last Administration would cover some of the acknowledged imperfections in the apportionment of powers between Commonwealth and States, by allowing the Commonwealth to compel the States to appoint Wages Boards in regard to all clearly defined industries. It was our intention to propose to go further, and by the creation of an Inter- State Commission, to reconcile discrepancies between the State awards, or to get over the difficulty pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, which might be caused through a tribunal in one State being prevented from raising wages to a fair standard by reason of the low rates prevailing in another State. </para>

                            <para>- Or a delegation of power by the State Parliaments. It would have got over difficulties without taking from the States the whole of their industrial powers, and it would have permitted the application of the methods of the State Wages Boards. But we shall get over the difficulty of any discrepancy that may, perhaps, prevent fair competition in trade between the two States. I think I have said sufficient to show that there is, at all events, some doubts as to our power to pass all these provisions under the guise of arbitration; and perhaps it would be wise to recast the Bill so as to bring it within the limits of our power. The criticism of the honorable member for Flinders, which was very clear and convincing, was directed to helping the Government in the difficulties they will find themselves in if they do not clean up their Acts. I have directed my criticism to showing that the Government are assuming a power that, possibly, they cannot obtain by any Act, an assumption which may imperil the whole of our legislation in this regard. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure we all feel indebted to members of the legal profession on both sides for their contributions to the debate ; but, as a fact, the more we hear them the more confused the position appears to laymen. We were always under the impression that arbitration was for the purpose of the prevention and settlement of disputes; but I am fast coming to the conclusion, if the contentions of honorable members opposite are correct, that it exists in name only - that it will be of po benefit to the industrial workers, or the employers of  1  his country. If this legislation is confined entirely to industrial organization within an industry, it will be impossible, in the state of unionism to-day, when there are craft unions throughout, for those unions to get the benefit. It is evident to me that that must be the position from which we have to view the Act, if the contentions set up are correct. Arbitration was introduced, not only for the purpose of dealing with a dispute after it has arisen, but for the prevention of disputes likely to arise. If the men have no legal right to approach the Court because they belong to a craft union, the Court will fail entirely in settling disputes except in the case of one or two unions which may be described as under a system of industrial unionism. I may be wrong, but I think that the Australian Workers Union is the only complete industrial union i.n existence in Australia. </para>

Personally, I believe the day has arrived when there should be industrial unionism, but an industrial  unionism not confined to one particular industry. If the employes could see what was best in their own interest, they would organize right throughout Australia in one large industrial body, including every craft, with a view to bettering their condition. </para>

                            <para>- Such a union would simplify matters considerably. There would be one big case dealing with appeals from each branch, and there would be a decision operating throughout Australia, taking into account the varying conditions. I take it, however, that such an idea is ahead of the times. While unionism has done a good deal for the workers in the past, the organization on the other side is practically getting too strong for present circumstances. I believe the men will have to rest their case on legislation ; and the only way to get effective legislation is by a thorough system of industrial unionism, so that they may make their weight felt through the ballot-box. I may be ahead of the time ; but what I have suggested is coming along. While I hold that view, however, it does not follow that I support legislation to prevent craft unions getting the benefit of the Act. </para>

We are here to legislate for conditions as we find them now ; and we are supposed to legislate in order to redress grievances and to prevent strikes and locks-out. tt is not a question of our individual views ; and in that I differ from the honorable member for Cook, who thinks that this Act should now be confined to industrial unionism. </para>

                            <para>- No, and that is just the trouble. From time to time different claims have been made covering one section only, or what might be called a craft, leaving the others out, so that one part may have industrial trouble, and the other none. If it came to the worst, I suppose the clear section could be asked to fall into line and cease work. If we had industrial unionism, as it ought to be, such a position would not be possible. </para>

If the contentions of honorable members opposite are correct in regard to this Act, the Commonwealth can do nothing. With the exception of one or two industries, it would be impossible to regulate any dispute. As to the engine-drivers, it may be asked why they do not try the State tribunals. But they have been trying the Wages Boards for over twelve months. </para>

                            <para>- And without getting any satisfaction. Then, when they go to the Arbitration Court, they are told by the High Court that there is no jurisdiction. If men cannot get redress for their industrial grievances, we must expect strikes. We cannot expect men to be loyal to an Act of Parliament if it does not provide proper facilities for redressing grievances; and it is unfair to expect it of them. We provided that before trouble arises the parties should approach the Judge in friendly conference; but what is the use of that if the High Court holds that there is no jurisdiction? It only means that the men have wasted their time and money, and have no hope of a satisfactory award. The honorable member for Darling Downs, with whose arguments I was somewhat impressed, contends that the proposed amendment is' unconstitutional, inasmuch as it takes away the right of a writ of prohibition or mandamus. The honorable member may be right ; I shall not venture my opinion against his in a legal matter. If he is correct, however, the Act is of no use to us. We passed an Arbitration Act with the object of obtaining a decision from the point of view of equity and good conscience. On questions of law, there is appeal ; but unionists never for a moment expected that there would be any appeal on the merits. If the amendment is unconstitutional, the unions are going to be mulcted in unnecessary expense; for what is the use of obtaining a decision when there is all the probability of its being upset by the High Court? I hardly think, however, that the contentions of honorable members opposite are correct; but if they are the sooner we let the public know that the Federal Parliament cannot deal with industrial powers the better - the sooner we ask the public to give us enlarged powers the better it will be. Let us cease to play with the question. </para>

                            <para>- It would be better to have two Courts to appeal to, if that would be the means of preventing great industrial upheavals. If we are going to ask industrial bodies to resort to arbitration, we should give them every facility to approach the Court, and some assurance that there will not be endless appeals involving great expense and probably the upsetting of an award. The honorable member for Parkes said that the claim made when the first compulsory Arbitration Bill was introduced in the New South Wales Parliament was that it would do away with all strikes. I think he will admit, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise;</inline> in introducing that Bill, clearly pointed out that all that could be hoped was that the passing of such legislation would reduce the number of strikes. That is the position I have taken up from the outset. I have always said that we can never hope to wholly abolish strikes, nor can we hope to' prevent locks-out in their entirety '; but we can legislate . to enable the parties to a dispute to bring their case before a Court with a view to a settlement being arrived at.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook.- Under this craft unionism, a bigger strike could be secured. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. The position of the engine-drivers who are members of a craft union is a case in point. They have been fighting from Court to Court to secure an award, and, although they could have struck at any time, they did not do so. Every inducement was really held out to the men to say, " We have been trying to get satisfaction for months, and we shall now discontinue work until we can obtain a settlement." </para>

                            <para>- There was nothing to prevent the engine-drivers striking had they desired to do so, and it redounds to their credit that they did not. They . resorted, instead, to a constitutional method of obtaining a settlement of their trouble. But if we cannot give the workers outside some better method of obtaining redress than is now available, we can look for nothing else but trouble. I desire to be perfectly candid, and I say at once that if we cannot obtain a better system of arbitration than we have at present, then I, for one, shall very shortly go against it. I have almost arrived at that point. I have spoken and fought- for arbitration for many years, but if I find that arbitration, as it exists, is not satisfactory, that we have no power to make it satisfactory, and that the people refuse to give us that power, then I shall say that the workers should have the utmost freedom to do as they please. It is a shame to pass industrial laws, under which certain individuals might probably be placed in gaol, without giving the workers any proper means of redress. Unlike the. honorable member for Parkes, I do not think that  certain men, owing to certain industrial happenings, should have suffered heavy penalties because of their position as leaders. Whilst I want to respect the law, I know the men to whom the honorable member referred, and, having been associated with them, I 'can honestly say that they are as good as any man in this Chamber. Whenever I hear of one of these men being sentenced, my heart goes out to him. I am sorry for these occurrences, and feel that we should endeavour to give those engaged in industry some satisfactory means of settling their grievances other than that of resorting to a strike. The honorable member for Parkes went further, and said that nearly every industrial dispute was really a strike. If he will carefully examine the definition of " lock-out," and then call to mind the facts in relation to only one industry - that of mining - he will be ready to admit, I am sure, that in a great many cases locks-out, and not strikes, have occurred. Let me give one illustration. I remember a case going to the Arbitration Court regarding the position of coal miners, who were paid by the yard, and who, it was said, should be paid on a tonnage rate. I am referring to the men of the Northern Extended and Gartlee collieries. The Court decided that they should be paid on the tonnage rate, and, in order to ascertain what the tonnage rate ought to be, there had to be an ascertainment of the selling price of coal. That ascertainment was made, and the men were awarded the ridiculously low rate of rs. 1 id. per ton. They were disinclined to accept that award, and for the moment cried a halt. The honorable member for Parkes says that he did not hear of one Labour leader condemning their action. But what are the true facts? The union officers went to the men and said, ' ' Here is an award of the Court, and, although it is very unsatisfactory, you must accept it. We advise you to go back to your work, and we will make application to have it revised." The men returned to work, but it was not long before machines were introduced, and the whole system changed, notwithstanding that the award was to run for three years. </para>

Had that stand been taken up, the Court would have varied the award and altered the condition of payment. The employers, however, did not take up that attitude.

In an adjoining colliery - the Pacific - 2s. 6£d. per ton was being paid, but, because of this award, which really had no relation to' it, the rate was also reduced in that colliery to is. nd. The men would not accept that reduction. The employers replied, " The mine is open, and you can go on if you like " : but they declined to do so. </para>

                            <para>- I could cite other cases if time would permit of my doing so. The honorable member may accept my assurance, however, that my statement of the facts is correct. The result of this action was that that mine was idle for months, and the newspapers described the situation as a strike. Such a condition of affairs must be rectified by legislation. The honorable member for Parkes was hardly fair in his reference to the men in the Newcastle district. He also said that the rural workers in New South Wales intended to deprive a man of the right to employ his family on his own farm. I have looked through the claim in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> but can find nothing bearing on the point, save a paragraph showing that they are opposed to children working on farms during school hours. After all, the Education Acts of some of the States declare that to be illegal. I am going to put my faith in the Attorney-General and his advisers. I am not going to argue the legal aspects of this question, but if during this debate any arguments are, or have been, advanced to cast a doubt upon the position, I trust that the Attorney-General and the officers of his Department will take them into serious consideration, with a view of so amending the Bill as to prevent decisions under it being upset on appeal to the (High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. ATKINSON</inline> (Wilmot)  [3-26]--  Sufficient has been said by honorable members on both sides of the House to show that this is not the trifling measure that a casual visitor to the House listening to the Attorney-General's opening speech might have imagined it to be. I should like to say, in passing, that we are all glad to see the Attorney-General in his place once more, and that I feel sure it was only because of the indifferent state of his health that he did not give us a fuller explanation of this measure. The Bill is a very important one, because it purports to make material changes in the system of arbitration as hitherto followed in the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Gippsland made an interjection a little while ago, in which he seemed to charge the Opposition with a desire to defeat the Bill. There is no such desire on our part. If we wished to defeat it, we should either vote against the motion for the "second reading, or move an amendment that it be read a second time this day six months. Our desire in submitting the amendment was to secure from the House an expression of opinion such as would enable us in Committee to bring the Bill into line with the original scheme of arbitration. The great change proposed to be effected by this Bill relates to the definition of the word " industry." A very definite meaning was given to that word, as used in the original Act, in the Engine-drivers' case. In that case, the Court made it clear that "industry" meant, not a handicraft or individual vocation, but some collective enterprise in which employers and employes are engaged. It contemplates a relationship between the persons engaged in what are known, in the broad sense, as industries, such as mining, soap and candle making, tanning, and so forth. That is in contradistinction to an avocation or handicraft such as carpentering or engine-driving. The change is attempted to be brought about by clauses  2  and  3,  which constitute an attempt to get round the decision of the High Court by permitting any number of people who earn their living by the same handicraft to unite and become registered as an organization under the Act. We have been told by those in this House who can speak with authority that the Bill will probably prove to be unconstitutional. I think they are right ; but even if it is not unconstitutional it will probably prove very inconsistent with the existing Act in many cases when it comes before the Court for decision. We are only amending the meaning of the word " industry " in certain sections of that Act. There are other sections in which it still retains its original meaning. Consequently, when the Court has to read the original Act and this Bill together, it will be found that a conflict of meaning exists. That will cause great difficulty, and that is why the honorable member for Flinders advised the Government to recast the whole of this legislation if they wished to achieve their purpose. It is a serious matter for this House to send out a measure which will bear such a peculiar appearance when the Courts have to interpret it. I hope that, in Committee, the Government will be amenable to reason, and allow the Opposition to assist them to make the measure consistent with the original Act. What are likely to be the results if this great change is allowed to come about? We shall, in the first place, create something like a revolution in our system of arbitration, by changing the whole basis of the original Act. We shall have substituted for a collective system what may be called a craft system, and when it is put into practical operation we shall find that we have departed a long way from the original intention of the Act. This Bill does not attempt in so many words to nullify the provision that the Arbitration Court is to deal only with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. In fact, it retains those very words ; but its real effect is to repeal them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> who was the prime mover in our arbitration legislation, wanted to create a tribunal to grapple with those big disputes that defied the powers of any State Court to settle, because they extended beyond the limits of the State. In effect we are going to eliminate that limitation by allowing organizations of people who earn their living by the same sort of work, such as carpenters, to be registered under the Act. That means the creation of craft organizations extending from one end of the continent to the other, and, therefore, it will be possible to claim that almost every dispute extends beyond the limits of one State. That was not intended or contemplated when our scheme of arbitration was first introduced. To a certain extent, therefore, this Bill achieves what could have been done if the late referenda had been carried. It will throw so much work on to the Federal Arbitration Court that the Court will be quite unable to cope with it. During the referenda campaign I and other honorable members made a strong point of retaining as far as possible local matters for the decision of local tribunals in the light of local knowledge. In a continent so vast as Australia, with such varying climatic and other conditions, it seems an impossibility for any one Court to make an award that will meet the case fairly all over the Commonwealth. It is like some one sitting in London regulating the conditions of labour in Russia. Fancy one Court settling the wages for all the gold miners throughout Australia ! Wages and conditions that may be good in Bendigo would not in any way compensate a gold miner in Kalgoorlie. There the miners are paid about  ^4  a week, but I suppose <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 15s. a week is all that would be earned by men in the same grade of work in Bendigo. </para>

                        <para>- The tendency of one Court dealing with industries throughout Australia must be to gradually attempt to make the wages as uniform as possible. It would be futile for one Court to attempt any such gigantic task. I wish to keep our local tribunals as strong and capable of dealing with matters that are fairly within the States as possible. That is the best for the industry and all engaged in it, and for the community generally. No one who takes an impartial view of industrial matters can deny that the Wages Boards are far and away the most effective means yet devised for dealing with these troubles. </para>

                            <para>- The Court became very congested with work. Matters were listed that would probably not have been heard for two 5'ears.  In New Zealand, which has had arbitration longer than Australia has, the whole Parliament, judging by a debate that has lately taken place, is satisfied that some radical change will have to be made, as the Arbitration Act has failed to meet present conditions. In that debate, many members recommended the introduction of a Wages Board system. </para>

                            <para>- My point is that when this Bill comes into operation the work of the Court will become too great. Even if the Court can cope with it, it is better to leave local matters to local tribunals composed of people on the spot, with a better knowledge of local conditions. The Prime Minister said the other night that the States could and still would have their tribunals. That is so; but it must be remembered that the people of Australia will not consent to pay two <inline font-style="italic">agents to</inline> do the one piece of work for them. These Courts are expensive enough, and no State would be prepared to keep up its Wages Boards if the more expensive Federal Court sat side by side with them and perhaps overruled- them. It is farcical to compare an Arbitration Court with Wages Boards. In nine cases out of ten the business in hand is the arrangement of fair conditions and proper rates of pay for an industry ; and it is absurd to expect, a Judge who has no practical knowledge, and must be guided wholly by evidence, to understand the position as well as a Board of experts. Wages Boards deal with matters more quickly., effectively, and cheaply, than an Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I would point out to the Government that the Bill, apparently, would allow any 100 persons to register as an organization. That probably is not intended. We cannot look at this proposal wholly from the employes' side, being here to pass laws for the whole community. The original Act considers the two parties to an industrial dispute and the interest of the public. Very often the general community is as much affected by an industrial struggle as the actual participants. The Bill puts employers in a worse position than they occupy now. Under it all the carpenters, or all the engine-drivers, in Australia might form themselves into an organization, and be registered; but how could the employers band together? Under the principal Act, as at present, an employer knows how his industry is affected by any award, because it applies to all the different classes of workmen in his employ. But under the Bill an award may be given regarding engine-drivers generally, or carpenters, and a soap and candle manufacturer would have to ascertain, not what awards had been made regarding his industry, but what awards had been made regarding every class of workmen which he employed. </para>

                            <para>- The Wages Board awards cover small areas. Very properly, the control of local conditions is in the  1  lands of those who understand them. Under the Bill one man would regulate the conditions for the whole continent. I am glad that no heat has been imported into the debate, because the subject is one affecting the interests of all parties. Speakers sometimes make it appear that the Labour party represent one section and their opponents another section of the community; but I take it that when this Government puts forward a policy, it does so to benefit, not a section of, but the whole people. Every one is of opinion that industries should pay the highest wages possible; but the rates of wages must not be so high as to kill the industry which is required to pay them. Credit is not always given to us on this side of the House for the view I have expressed. But the Federal Parliament, or any section of it, has never advocated anything in the shape of sweating or low wages ; and I hope we never shall. The best plan, I think, is to leave the question of local conditions to the people with the most local knowledge. If a man at the Gulf of Carpentaria is receiving 15s. a day, is that any reason why an industry in Victoria, where the conditions of life are so  much superior, should be saddled with a similar. wage? </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that anybody is. But why should a Victorian industry, which can afford no more than 12s. a day, be exposed to the danger of extinction? What we desire is not unemployment, but employment, with a fair share to all. This is a most .difficult question to settle with justice to every person interested ; but, in my opinion, the best system yet devised, though it is not perfect, is the Wages Board system. One of my serious objections to the measure before us is that it will practically nullify the Wages Boards which have done so well in the past. The Arbitration Act has not come up to expectations, and that it has not been an unqualified success is seen in the industrial unrest. It would not be right, however, to say that the Act has been a failure because of the strikes that have taken place, seeing that there might have been more strikes if there had been no Act. The industrial unrest shows us that, at any rate, we have not obtained the objects we set out to obtain, and we are now asked to make a revolutionary change, with no prospect of improving the conditions. I hope that, in Committee, the Attorney-General may be induced to accept some amendments at least, seeing that the amending Bill, as it stands, would prove inconsistent with the original measure when the two are construed together. I confidently believe that the Opposition will be able to supply the Attorney-General with some very useful material, if he will condescend to accept it. </para>
