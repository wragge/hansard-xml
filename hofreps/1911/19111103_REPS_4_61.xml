            <para>- I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> what is the position regarding the parliamentary refreshment bar. Yesterday afternoon the House resolved that intoxicating liquor shall no longer be supplied within its precincts, but about a fortnight ago the Senate negatived a similar resolution. Must honorable members who occasionally desire alcoholic refreshment be invited to the bar by honorable senators ? Is a notice to be put up in the bar &#34; for honorable senators only,&#34; and will members of this House be expected to go elsewhere when they wish a little wine for their &#34; stomach&#39;s sake,&#34; as I occasionally do. If members of this House are not to be permitted to obtain liquors within the precincts, the bar should be removed to another position, because it is aggravating to have to pass a place where another member is getting a drink when one is not allowed to get one there himsel f . </para>

The Government will do. everything in its power as in duty bound, to see that the law is obeyed. Ministers are sworn to do that.

              <para>- My attention was called to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen</inline> ; and the facts, as stated by him, and read by the honorable member for Parramatta, are, to the best of my knowledge and belief, absolutely correct. That is to say, an agreement did and does exist, and it covers members of the union who work in Sydney as well as those who work in every other port of the Commonwealth. It is a fact that, without any notice at all to their organization, or to any of the branches, the men in Sydney ceased work and broke the agreement. It is a fact, of .course, as I have said here previously, that on their doing so, the Council was immediately called together, and the men were asked to resume work, and declined. The honorable member for Parramatta went on to point out what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen</inline> had declared his intention to do. As for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen&#39;s</inline> offer to appoint arbitrators, I say that there is nothing to arbitrate about. There is the agreement which, the Federation has entered into, and the men must keep it - they must abide by the conditions, and there is nothing to arbitrate about. So far as the deep-sea men are concerned, I know nothing of the terms of the agreement, if any, existing between them and the deep-sea stevedores. As regards this Government, the position appears to be this : Under the agreement there is a provision made for a penalty, which is, after all, nothing but liquidated damages, for the recovery of which the Attorney-General cannot proceed. </para>

            <para>If it is a penalty in the proper sense and not&#39; damages, the agreement itself seems not to be an industrial agreement under the Act, for it relates to industrial disputes in the State of New South Wales only, and not to industrial disputes extending  beyong  the limits of a State (sec. 4). </para>
            <para>If it is not an industrial agreement the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners&#39; Association can. sue for it also, and the chances of success are therefore much greater than if the Registrar sued for the recovery of the penalty. The foregoing is clearly an answer to any question as to why the Registrar has not sued under, sec. 44 (2) (a). </para>
            <para>If proceedings are taken by either the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners&#39; Association or by one of its component companies, or by the Registrar, they would seem to have to be taken,, not against the Wharf Labourers&#39;  Union or Waterside Workers&#39; Federation, or the officialsthereof, who are apparently innocent, but against some one or more workmen who have actually struck work (sec. 44 (1). </para>
            <para>As regards the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration, it would be well to understand clearly that it has no jurisdiction to deal with thisNew South Wales dispute by way of arbitration ; but as there was for some time danger of the dispute extending to the other States the  President  exercised his jurisdiction under section i6&#171; to call the parties together to prevent the extension of the dispute to some other State. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That appears to be the position, and nothing, therefore, can be done by the Government until, if such a contingency should unfortunately arise, the dispute extends to other States, when, of course, quite apart from the agreement, there would be an Inter-State dispute, over which the Court has jurisdiction. There remains,, then, nothing for the Government to do, and everything that can be done by the organization, as such, has been done. I very much regret the position individually.  I am perfectly confident in my own mind that the overwhelming majority of the men now on .strike do not desire, and never did1 desire, for one solitary half-minute, tostrike. </para>

              <para>- Those honorable members who have had any experience of unions will understand perfectly the position which I put. According to the statement made to me by the Registrar, there were 170 or 180 men present at the meeting which originally decided to strike. There may have been a few more or less at the meeting - I am not quite sure - but there are 4,700 men, to my certain knowledge, in the union. If that meeting had not carried a resolution to strike, there would have been no strike. That is what I meant ; and I am going by what I know of the union - no man knows it better - and I say deliberately now that, if a ballot were taken in the union, there would be an overwhelming majority for a return to work. </para>

              <para>- The experiment, I believe, will be found to be impracticable, and neither advantageous nor economical. It is absurd to think of storing in one centre timber for distribution all over the Commonwealth when local requirements can be supplied on the spot. I doubt very much whether there is as much in this idea as some people believe, but even if the Government specified that contractors for Government buildings should use only seasoned timber supplied by the State, I think that the scheme would be found unworkable. I am afraid that there is something in the nature of a fad about this proposal, and, as the representative of a district where hard woods are largely produced, I think the experiment should not be proceeded with. If the Government specify that only seasoned timber should be used on a Government work, why should not the contractor for that work be permitted to purchase that timber wherever he desires to do so? There are in the trade people who make a point of storing millions of feet of timber, so that it may be properly seasoned. Seasoned timber can be purchased in Sydney or Melbourne to-day by any one who requires it. I am not so hide-bound as to be unable to appreciate any innovation, but I am afraid that this experiment is due to the fact that the Minister, who has no personal experience, has been led away by the recommendations of others who are also without experience, and that it will result in loss to the Government. The experience of all men engaged in the building trade is that seasoned timber can be purchased, in the sizes specified, in almost any part of the State of New South Wales. If the intention of the Government is merely to erect sheds in Melbourne or Sydney, and store timber there, I fail to see how they are going to compel contractors for the erection of public buildings in, say, my own electorate, to carry timber from&#39; the Sydney shed to the district where, perhaps, it was produced. I am willing to give fair consideration to any innovation that may be proposed, but I hold the view that this experiment should not be taken up, and I hope the Government will not proceed with it. </para>

            <para>.- I trust that the Minister will stand by the item. I have been in the building trade all my life, and am satisfied that the Government are well advised in taking steps to secure a supply of seasoned timber. Nothing depreciates the value of a building to a greater extent than does the use of unseasoned timber in its construction, for green timber causes the walls to crack in every direction. Since the Government propose to erect largebuildings in the Federal Capital and other parts of the Commonweal th, they are acting wisely in taking time by the forelock and providing for supplies of seasoned timber. </para>

              <para>- I know men in the building trade who have had to wait weeks to get even green timber. The price of timber is gradually increasing, and there is every reason to believe that that which we buy to-day and store for seasoning purposes will be far more valuable later on. The Government cannot go wrong in storing and seasoning timber. Their proposal is not to compete with timber merchants. This is simply an attempt to provide for our own requirements. The honorable member for Cowper spoke of the Government specifying in their contracts that only certain timber should be used. That is quite a common practice. The Government of New South Wales for example in inviting tenders for the building of an iron bridge specify that the iron shall have been made in the Commonwealth. We have a right to protect ourselves, and I hope that the Committee will not quibble over this item. All men in a large way of business try to keep by them a stock of seasoned timber for building, furniture-making, and other purposes, so that this is really not an experiment. I commend the action of the Minister. </para>

            <para>. - We ought to have some information from the Minister regarding the item. I have no objection to the Government making experiments in regard to the seasoning of timber, but the question raised by the honorable member for Cowper is a very important one. Surely it would be unwise to centralize the timber seasoning process in Melbourne or Sydney and to send timber from one of those centres to Queensland or Western Aus tralia, where material equally good could be obtained on the spot. I do not hesitate to say that if a reasonable order be given and reasonable time allowed any man can secure all the seasoned timber he requires at an exceedingly reasonable price. Instead of there being a dearth of timber, the position until quite recently has been the reverse. For four years and until quite recently the timber mills had an exceedingly bad time, and had to export timber at prices which, in some cases, scarcely paid for cutting. I hope that the Minister will be careful not to attempt to localize in any one State, or in the hands of a few people, the storing and seasoning of the timber required for Commonwealth purposes. </para>

              <para>- My experience of the honorable member is that he judges every one by the unfortunate standard of his own particular proclivities. I suggest to the Minister that it would be better to have a number of small experimental stations or stores in the different States. A process that might be suitable for the seasoning of the pines of Queensland or the jarrah of Western Australia might be totally unsuitable in the case of the stringy bark and blue gums of Tasmania and Victoria. It is well that these experiments should be made, but the Minister, instead of having one large station in Victoria, should distribute his stores over the various States. If the Minister contemplates storing a&#39; large amount of timber, cut green, and stacked in sheds without any preparation at all he will find by the time he requires to use it that some of it is turning round and looking at him. I hope the Minister will go a good deal further than he now proposes, and take in hand some of the many preparations now known by which timber can be dried and seasoned without risk of curling, twisting, and splitting. TheMinister should also have these stations distributed all over Australia so that all the timbers of the different States will get a fair deal, because it would be positively absurd to attempt to use timber seasoned in Victoria for public works in Western Australia or Queensland. </para>

I can. assure the honorable member for Franklin, who says there is plenty of timber for all purposes in Australia, that there is great difficulty, for example, in getting timber, especially Queensland pine, for butter boxes. There should be no need for the Department to rent premises for storing purposes. The back yards of the postoffices in various centres can be made use of for storing timber to be used from time to time in the surrounding districts. I am not enamoured of the idea of patent or hurried seasoning. I question whether it gives the same good results as are obtained from sun-dried or air-seasoned timber. If the Minister proposes to extend his operations in that direction he will require far more money than he asks for in this item. If he wants to go even further than he now proposes, I will lend him every help, because a good supply of seasoned timber will mean that the erection of our public buildings will not be retarded by a shortage of timber supplies. </para>

            <para>.- If the Government are serious in wishing to season a lot of timber for use in public buildings they can hardly expect to do it by the methods proposed within the time required. There are a number of wellknown systems for seasoning timber, and if any of them are to be adopted provision will have to be made on the Estimates for the. necessary machinery and kilns. Storing in sheds is not always the most desirable way of seasoning. It takes a long time. In England it has been found that the best way with certain timbers is. to leave the logs lying in the water until the natural sap is leached out Then the water which has taken the place of the sap is evaporated, and the timber is found to be better seasoned than if the sap had been left in it. As to the statement that timber is not procurable for public purposes in Australia, honorable members can find an object lesson in this building, containing as it does perhaps the finest piece of work that has ever been put up in the way of timbering and joining. It has stood here for twenty or thirty years to my knowledge, and I defy any one to say it was not built with seasoned timber. There is nothing wrong with it after all that time. </para>

              <para>- Any one who has the money can get whatever he wants in Australia. Storing alot of timber in a shed will never meet the requirements of the Department. They must go a little deeper into the matter. Whatever timber is required can be obtained in the log or the plank from the different States, brought to one centre, and there put through the process best suitable for each class. Timber is brought to Melbourne in the log from all parts of the world to-day. I passed a trolley load of oak logs only the day before yesterday in Collins-street. They had come from Japan, and would be seasoned here bywhatever processwas most suitable. The system of seasoning which is suitable for hard wood is not suitable for soft wood. If the Department stacks a lot of timber in twenty or thirty sheds, and tries to treat it all by the same process, no good result will be arrived at. The best and most scientific methods known to the world must be adopted. A great deal has been said of the process of Powellising timber by putting it through boiling water or steam, and then treating it with arsenic and sugar, but I think the boiling orsteaming has as much to do with the result as the stuff which is put into it afterwards. Some years ago a vacuum system by which the natural sap was drawn from the timber, was established at Port Adelaide, in South Australia, but so far as I know no process has been so successful as that which I have described as adopted in England. Whoever took on the business of furnishing this House knew more about the processes of seasoning timber than we do here to-day. </para>

              <para>- I doubt if the building of the Federal Capital will be done in a hurry. I believe there will be plenty of time to adopt any system known to the world for seasoning the timber that will be required to furnish the new Parliament House there. It would be hardly advisable to use the hardwoods of Australia in all work. Before money is spend on sheds the Minister should get the best advice obtainable as to the systems of seasoning most suitable for the woods which he proposes to use. </para>

            <para>.- I agree with a good deal that has been said, but I believe the Minister&#39;s action is in the right direction. The question seems to be whether he should adopt some recognised artificial system of seasoning timbers, or whether he should erect sheds as proposed. It is in the best interests of the Commonwealth, from the point of view of economy, to have all the timber it requires seasoned, and the question of whether Powellising or any other system should be adopted is a matter for future consideration, which will take a considerable time. </para>

              <para>- It may be, but whilst the Government are obtaining information with regard to the different processes some time must elapse, and when the information is obtained a considerable sum of money will be necessary in order to bring the system which is adopted into operation. Our position is that we require timber immediately. Consequently it is necessary to procure it at once, and allow &#39;it to season by exposing .it to the open air, perhaps under cover of sheds. Our experience has been that timber is now bought direct from the mills and put down before it is properly seasoned, with the result that the floors shrink, and have to be taken up and relaid. </para>

In one case I put the timber aside for four months to season, and as a result I had no trouble with the floor. The Powellising system which is used by a certain firm in Sydney is chiefly intended to prevent the ravages of white ants. The Minister has acted properly in providing sheds so that timber may be obtained from the different mills within the Commonwealth, and not imported. If we have&#34; timber of our own, we should obtain it and allow it to season until it is wanted. I can assure the honorable member for Franklin that timber is scarce in Australia. I represent a timber-growing constituency - as I did in the State Parliament - and know that timber supplies are rapidly being exhausted, and that as a result the price of timber has increased by 5s. or 6s. per 100 feet during the last few years. </para>

Timber should be obtained at least five or six months before it is needed. </para>

              <para>- I hope that we shall have an explanation from the Minister of what is intended. The need for storing timber has been emphasized by honorable members. I am sorry that the Minister, who prides himself on his progressiveness, has not commenced to grow timber for the Commonwealth. We are asked to vote and re-vote sums for expenditure on the Federal Capital amounting to ,&#163;100,000, and if the whole amount were expended in planting timber in the Federal area, it would make provision for the future which would be very valuable, and prevent expenditure in directions in which it is not yet necessary. We have, too, enormous areas which might profitably be devoted to the planting of timber. Re-afforestation is one of the most important problems that the Commonwealth and the States have to face. The States might have done more, and we might have done more. In other countries timber reserves are a most valuable asset. The German Government looks after its forests in accordance with the most scientific and best technical principles, and benefits therefrom to the extent of several millions a year. Most of the Federal area, not being suitable for cultivation, should be fit for the growing of timber, it having been proved all over the world that where there is a sufficient rainfall timber can be grown satisfactorily on poor country. On the European Alps, land which was previously valueless has been planted with trees, and now produces good returns. </para>

            <para>. - The Department has had a good deal of trouble at times in obtaining seasoned timber, and complaints have been made by honorable members about the difficulty of getting work done Owing to the difficulty in obtaining assistance from New South Wales and Victorian officials, who have had an immense amount of work to do themselves, although they have done what they could for us, we have decided, in the interests of expedition, to look after our own works in the two States named, and are, therefore, providing timber stores in them, so that if we cannot get what we need from the mills we can draw on our own supplies. On the Federal area we had a great deal of trouble in getting timber, and had to send all through this electorate of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro for it, buying it green. In some of my own houses I find the verandahs looking at me when I go for the rents, showing that the timber has not been properly seasoned. </para>

              <para>- A Labour Minister must always do that, because his promises are his capital. I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera that there are several processes used; for instance, the one in operation in Sydney has cost the present Mayor of that city&#163;25,000. Possibly later we may have to adopt some process of the kind, which, I understand, has been successful in Western America for over thirty years. They will be required, perhaps, in the building of the transcontinental railway, when there must be timber to resist the white ants. At present, however, we only ask for &#163;700, with a view later to having a shed in each State where timber can be stored and ready for use without delay. We are going to run great industries and have mighty activities in contemplation ; and we must make preparation, especially in a territory like this, where there is little or no settlement, and everything is in a state of nebulosity. Under the circumstances we cannot put down the exact sum for every complete work. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister of Home Affairs has talked about everything and anything but the particular item under discussion. What kind of timber is it proposed to store? The Minister tells us that in the Federal area all sorts of timber has to be used in a green state; but a great deal of our timber cannot be used in any other form. Honorable members who have had any experience of building with seasoned ironbark will know what I mean. </para>

On the other hand, all the joinery woods, such as cedar, rosewood, beech, silky oak, and Queensland maple, may be stored and seasoned as much as we like, and are improved thereby, provided they are kept free from ants. </para>

            <para>.- I also am of opinion that the Minister is wasting the&#34; country&#39;s money in providing <inline font-style="italic">&#163;joo</inline> for the seasoning of this timber. No doubt it is difficult to season hardwood, but it can be done with proper attention in the case of many varieties. When I was in the Public Works Department we found that if we did not season the hardwood we had a tough job in getting the buildings in proper line. Why I say the Minister is wasting the public money is that in the Northern Territory, and in Papua, we have Possessions from which very valuable timber could be obtained, and where we could establish our own saw-mills. </para>

            <para>.- I am concerned, not so much with the amount of  this vote, as with the principle it involves. This appears to me to be another step in the direction of socializing the enterprises of the Commonwealth ; and that view is strengthened by the speeches of the Minister and of the honorable  member  for Corio. Both of these gentlemen showed us clearly that this proposal is only the straw which indicates the flow of the stream, and that it is intended, ultimately, to establish great and important Commonwealth work&#39;s in regard to the growing and storage. of timber. The success of public enterprises of this kind, up to the present, does not justify us in increasing them, for they are not carried on by the State anything like so satisfactorily as they are by private enterprise. It would seem as if this Parliament has conceived the idea of a socialistic condition of things which. I am quite sure, is not shared by the great bulk of the public. What use can these sheds serve unless they are to be stacked with timber, and how large a sum of money is likely to be involved in filling them with timber if we are te carry a stock sufficient to supply the needs which the Minister has mentioned? I do not think the great bulk of honorable members have seriously considered this question. The erection of the sheds is a comparatively trivial matter, but the storage of timber will involve us in an expenditure that is of the utmost importance. The sheds will be absolutely useless unless a very large sum is spent in storing timber in them. . </para>

              <para>- I cannot secure his attention; if he has the figures he has not given them to us. The honorable member for Corio has objected that this item does  not go far enough. He says that we ought to have our own saw-mills. If the Ministry submitted such a proposition to the people it would probably be rejected, because the country is not yet ripe for Socialism. By passing such items as these honorable members opposite are gradually undermining existing conditions in favour of a state of affairs under which the number of Commonwealth employes will be increased, and those engaged in private enterprise will have to compete with those employed by the State. Such a thing ought not to be encouraged, and I think, therefore, that we ought to reject this item. Representing, as I do, a large and important constituency, comprising the Goulburn Valley and Echuca districts, I shall raise a vigorous protest against every item of the kind in these Estimates. This is simply the initial movement towards establishing that which the people whom I represent strongly object to. </para>

              <para>- I think not. I know contractors in Sydney who are prepared to give  2s.  and  3s.  per thousand feet more for dry timber than they are giving for that which is now available; but they cannot get it. Green timber is more costly to work than is dry timber. A joiner cannot use green timber and give satisfaction to the person for whom he is working, and the same may be said with regard to the use of unseasoned timber in the building trade generally. Every system of drying timber tried up to the present time has been purely experimental. Timber can be made fit for use only by atmospheric drying, and honorable members opposite, instead of condemning the Minister, should give him credit for taking action to ensure a supply of dry timber for use in our public buildings. Timber for furniture and fixtures must have been stored for at least four or five years. That which has been put .away for fifteen years is better still, and will pay for the cost of storing. Timber used in the manufacture of pianos is sometimes stored for twenty 3&#39;ears. I agree with the honorable member for Franklin that the timber-getters have not been receiving a fair price ; but that has not led to any reduction in prices to the consumers. The middleman has been reaping the advantage. Our timber supplies are controlled by a combine, which, either on the  1st  October or the first of the present month, put up prices by ib per cent. Our referenda proposals having been rejected, we cannot* deal with such com- . bines, and it is therefore more than ever necessary that this action should be taken. I trust that a much larger sum will be asked for to provide for the storing of timber, because seasoned timber must be an invaluable asset to the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - This seems to be a very small item to have occupied the attention of the Committee so long, but in some of its aspects it is undoubtedly important. I take it that it consists largely of a re-vote for a project which was discussed last year. I have no doubt in my own mind that many of the projects we are now putting into operation will furnish food for reflection later on, when we see their remnants scattered thick as leaves about the country, and reminding us of the time when people made foolish experiments with the people&#39;s money. We have, in fact, got into the habit in Victoria of voting a sum of money for a certain purpose and declaring, there and then, &#34; Look what a success it is,&#34; when, as a matter of fact, some years must elapse before we shall be able to take account of these experiments. Although the amount that we are asked to vote in respect&#39; of this item is small, I am told on good authority that if the Government propose to go in for the storing and seasoning of timber they will have to spend hundreds and thousands of pounds rather than the trifling&#163;50 or &#163;100 with which the Minister is now tinkering. I am afraid the Minister is neither doing this thing nor letting it alone. He cannot store very much timber in a place that costs&#163; 1,000 to build, and where is the money for the timber coming from? Is that on the Estimates, too? If we are to season timber for years, it means the expenditure ofhundreds of thousands of pounds, and if all these big projects are to be hung up pending the seasoning of our own timber, I am afraid my good friends, the Victorians, will be perfectly happy, for instance, about the Federal Capital. From all I can see. it is going to be some years yet before the preparations for the Federal Capital are by any means completed. </para>

              <para>- I believe we voted money last year to build mills with, and we are re-voting the same money to build the same mills now. At this rate the Minister, or somebody after him, will be storing and seasoning timber in the year 1956. Why Victorian members should keep pecking at the Minister on account of the Federal Capital, I do not know. I believe most of their attacks are only make-believe, because at the rate the Minister is going it will be fifty years before we get into the Federal Capital. The Minister is only tinkering with this question ; he cannot season timber on the scale that he is suggesting. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK. ^Flooring, and posts, and even rails, will need to be stored if the Department are going in for this process, and I make the confident prediction that next year the Minister, if in office, will still have these amounts on the Estimates - a little spent, but a big re-vote asked for - and that there will be no timber in these sheds when we meet again. If these items satisfy honorable members opposite, I suppose it is all right. They are on the Estimates, and what does it matter about the wo{k of the country as long as the Ministerial party are staging their Socialistic schemes? Let honorable members opposite stand up to them, or let them alone. Let us see them carry out their policy in an effective and sensible way. This proposal is doing nothing of the kind. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> is only playing at the job. </para>

            <para>.- There are several items that require explanation. The first is the sum of  &#163;100,000  for the Federal Capital, regarding which we are entitled to more information from the Minister than he gave us the other night. Last year  &#163;16,043  was expended upon the Capital site. The following are what the Minister said last year were covered by the proposed expenditure of  &#163;50,000  voted for  1910-11 : - &#163;13,000  for surveys of land;  &#163;5,000  for designs ;  &#163;4,000  for a nursery in which the Minister said he was going to plant a million trees j  &#163;22,000  for roads and bridges ; and  &#163;6.000  for the acquisition of lands. Out of that total of  &#163;50,000  he expended only  &#163;16,043.  We want to know from the Minister how much of those works have been carried out. How much of that money was spent upon surveys ? Has he started the large nursery for the planting of trees, which I quite agree is a very necessary and urgent undertaking if the Federal City is to be a beautiful one ? How much has been spent on the acquisition of land ? These are matters which I presume the Minister has at his fingers&#39; ends under his new reform system, and so he will be able to give us the information without any trouble. With regard to the expenditure for this year  the  matter is much more serious. The Minister stated that the contingent liability which we would incur by expending a sum of  &#163;100,000  on certain works would amount to  &#163;250,000.  What is that sum for? The Committee ought to know that, by voting the additional amount in these Estimates, they will commit themselves to an expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds. We should be clearly told by the Minister the particular items which are to involve us in&#39; that ultimate liability. I am not raising this question in any carping spirit, because, from what I know of the advisers who are behind the Minister in this matter, I believe they would advise him to take only sound courses of action. I believe that he has competent advisers, and I hope he will realize that he has the sympathy of the Committee in expediting necessary works. At the same time we like to know what we are doing. According to the Minister&#39;s statement the other night, the works to be constructed include a weir, bridge, water pipes, reservoir, temporary railway, power  plant,  road-making plant, bridge-building plant, and other things. The Minister, the other evening, bunched all those together, without giving any clear indication of what each would cost. Will he indicate clearly now the nature of &#163;ach of those works, giving the report of the engineers or other officers upon them, and describing what  they  are intended to serve? Will he say whether they are to be mere temporary works or to be part and parcel of the ultimate scheme of the completed city? Are the roads and the bridge which are to be built to be part of the general design of laying out the Federal Capital ? The Minister has indicated that the railway is to be only a sort of portable tram line. I do not think we can find fault with him in that respect ; but I think he had  &#163;22,000  down last year for that purpose. Is that what it is going to cost us? </para>

              <para>- The Minister also said that all the private properties within  a  radius of  7  miles of the city  are  to be resumed. Will he tell us now the exact area  of  the land which he is absolutely resuming within the city proper ? I presume that area has been surveyed, and that the Minister can give  us  definite information. He ought also  to  be in a position  to  indicate in what way it is proposed  to  administer the Federal territory; because we have now got beyond the stage when  that  large area  ought to be administered simply as a part of the ordinary work of a Department. We are approaching very near the time when it will be necessary to appoint a Board of Commissioners, or some other body. </para>

              <para>- Apart from that question, the problem of the government of the territory will ha,ie 1 to be faced very soon. Questions have already been raised regarding its representation in Parliament ; but it will become every year more necessary to think over the problem of its local government. It may be necessary to appoint three commissioners, to whom the administration of the whole of the city will be intrusted ; or we may have some elective municipality, or a combination of election and Government nomination. We need some body to carry out all public works in the territory and supply the House, from time to time, with a report to show exactly what is going on there. We are dealing &#34;with this matter to-day without any printed  report  showing the progress made, the nature of the works carried out, or the scheme that is ultimately to be evolved for the whole area. We are simply asked blindly to vote one large sum of ^100,000. </para>

              <para>- That is not necessary. The sum of ^100,000 is asked for as a contribution towards the cost of starting certain works. Not a penny can be spent until we obtain the necessary land. The Northern Territory land belongs to the Commonwealth, but the land in the Capital Territory is in the hands of freeholders, who purchased it years ago, and must be paid for it. We wish to erect a power plant, which will cost approximately ^20,000. </para>

              <para>- That is a new proposal. The honorable member for Wentworth has stated that the value put on the land must be that which it had in 1908, but he has not gone intothe question. Every improvement we make in the Territory adds to the value of the land, and will unconsciously bias any Judge before whom proceedings are taken for resumption. Besides, if we wait another ten years, who will be able toswear to the value of the land in 1908? </para>

              <para>- Only the outer skirts. Money is also required for the purchase of land ; and the reason for fixing  a  lump sum is that some of the works will depend  on its  acquisition. If we simply vote each item, we shall not be able  to  go beyond the vote, and at certain places the work must be stopped. After eighteen months&#39; experienceas Minister I have come to the conclusion  that  we have a most foolish method of finance. If we  had  a proper system, money not required for one item could be used for another, instead of having to be re-voted. </para>

            <para>.- Honorable members must more than ever be impressed with the necessity for some new arrangements in connexion with- the Federal Capital. Last night I said that some scheme ought to be laid before the House so that we mav know how much we are called upon to spend over a certain number of years ; and the importance of some statement on the subject is made more manifest by what we have heard from the Minister to-day. He now seeks to commit us to an expenditure of ^&#163;313,000, although the building of the city is not yet started. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to know the extent to which the Minister is prepared to go. Is the Committee going to blindly vote, year after year, immense sums to be expended in any way the Minister may think fit, or are we going to insist on a proper scheme for the government of the Territory, with the necessary policy statement placed before us and approved before the money is spent? We must not forget that last year strong objection was raised to the expenditure of .&#163;50,000. That was the beginning of this reckless expenditure; and I have no hesitation in saying that we are acting recklessly when we vote large sums in the absence of any binding details.  We were asked last year, without any warning, to vote .&#163;50,000 ; and we were kept here until the next morning before it was voted. Many members who voted for the expenditure on that occasion justified the Government; but they did not anticipate that a lump sum would be asked for again this year. The Minister tells us that &#163;24,000 has already been spent of the &#163;33,957 ; and I take it that that has been spent since the 1st July, or otherwise it would have been added to the .&#163;.16,000. I have good reason to know that the expenditure on the Territory was stopped about a couple of months ago, owing to the difficulty  of dealing with the lands ; and I should like to know the details of the expenditure of ,&#163;24,000 after the 1st July. We are asked to vote in this sum ,&#163;20,000 towards the expenditure on a. power plant, the establishment of brick-works, and a weir; without being told where these are to be  established. The weir involves the question of whether we are to have a pumping scheme of water supply, or, as the honorable member for Swan suggested the other day, a gravitation scheme. Is that question to be decided by the Minister at his own sweet will, or are we to have a say? It seems to me that we have reached a stage when we must insist on some scheme being submitted before we vote further money. There are other unsatisfactory aspects of the question. I have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> recollection of hearing the Minister, within the last twelve months, state that the Government were still negotiating with New South Wales for the handing over of some further territory in connexion with the waterworks. </para>

              <para>- We have not been told how . these negotiations have proceeded. I take it that, when the negotiations were started, it was considered necessary to obtain the land ; otherwise, why spend the money until the land is considered necessary? Again, the Government were also negotiating for some further territory at that precious seaport called Jervis Bay, where we have a small strip which stops at high- water mark.

              <para>- Then why was the Minister taken by surprise ? Why did he think it necessary to send two of his officers on Monday to furnish us with information, when the item was being debated? The Minister either knew nothing of the Government being determined to go on with the Estimates this week, or he simply sent those officers away on a fool&#39;s errand. If he considered it was necessary to get the information, he certainly ought to consent to postpone this item until it is obtained. Singularly enough, he tells us to-day that a report is to be issued to members showing what has been done up to date; but what is the use of giving us that information tomorrow when we are dealing with the item to-day ? In order to test the sincerity of the Committee, and taking it that the Minister has spent&#163;24,000 out of the &#163;33,000, I move- </para>

At this critical moment, we ought to have regard to the expenditure that must take place if this vote be passed. A warning was given last year when  &#163;50,000  was asked for purely preliminary work ; and we had no idea that the Minister would this year submit votes involving an expenditure of between  &#163;300,000  and  . &#163;400,000. </para>

              <para>- That may be all very well from the stand-point of the life of one individual, but we are intrusted with the destinies of Australia as a whole, and our first duty is to encourage people to come here, and to assist in developing the resources of the country as speedily as possible. Our public moneys should be expended in that direction before we proceed to a large outlay on ornamental buildings for which there is no crying necessity. If any of our early pioneers who struck out on the land, either as farmers, graziers, or cultivators, had expended the whole of their capital in building elaborate homesteads, instead of fencing in their ground, excavating dams, and otherwise improving the productivity of the soil, they would have found themselves in the Insolvency Court before they had made a fair start in the development of their holdings. But what position are we taking up? We are but a small scattered community controlling an enormous territory comprising  3,000,000  square miles, and there can be no doubt that it is the unmistakable duty of this Parliament to push on with thedevelopment of the continent. No one can say there is any pressing necessity to proceed at once to expend millions in building the Federal Capital in order that our work of legislation, may be carried on. There is no desire on the part of representatives of Victoria to keep the Federal Parliament in Melbourne for any length of time. I would willingly vote for any other capital city in the Commonwealth being made the Seat of Government in order that we might escape for some years, at least, the enormous expenditure of which this item on the Estimates is but a preliminary. We have to take up a new position in the light of the statement made to-day by the Minister of Home Affairs. Last year we were told that the item of  &#163;50,000  which we were asked to vote towards the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra was merely designed to meet preliminary expenses. To-day, however, we are asked to agree to an additional vote of &#163;66,000, and we have forecasted by the Minister an immediate expenditure of  &#163;313,000.  This sum of&#163;66,000 is to be expended on preliminary work, the total cost of which will amount to  &#163;313,000,  and we have the Minister&#39;s own statement that that work is to be the basis of a further outlay of  &#163;3,500,000.  This is a very serious matter, having regard to the fact that the present Government has already heaped up the debt of the Commonwealth to the extent of  &#163;14,500,000.  This is not the occasion on which to discuss the whole of the finances of the Commonwealth, but we cannot view this proposed expenditure of something like  &#163;3,500,000  on a Federal Capital without glancing at the growing general expenditure of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- If the Minister will restrain himself for a little while, I shall proceed to tell the Committee that I believe the expenditure to which I have just referred is necessary. I have no complaint to make regarding the way in which our liabilities have been increased to this extent. We shall be able to deal with all those matters when the Budget is before us; but I may say that I agree with the principle that, for the development of this great continent, these enormous works must be undertaken. That in itself is the best justification we could have for our objection to an expenditure of  &#163;3,500,000  on works at the Federal Capital, which cannot be reproductive, are not necessary, and, in time of drought and scarcity, must seriously detract from our ability to enter upon great undertakings that are essential to the development of the country. It is because we have incurred this great liability that I say we should hesitate to enter upon an expenditure with respect to the Federal Capital, for which there can be no justification at this early stage in our history. In view of the enormous debt we have incurred, we must also remember that our taxation has been substantially increased. The revenue from Customs and Excise last financial year is nearly  &#163;3,500,000  in excess of that of previous years, and we have also collected something like  &#163;1,500,000  in respect of the land tax. I am not prepared to say now whether or not there is any justification for the largely augmented revenue which the Treasury is enjoying, and to which our wonderful and beneficent seasons have materially contributed; but, in the light of this enormously increased revenue, and the substantial instalment of direct taxation that has been imposed, and in the light of the liabilities already incurred - amounting, as I have said, to nearly  &#163;14,500,000  - it must be admitted that there is no justification for the proposed heavy expenditure in ornamenting what is now an unpopulated expanse of country. This is not a battle between Victoria and New South Wales; no question of provincialism is involved. An important national issue is at stake, and it ought to appeal to every honorable member. We ought, first of all, to do our duty to the people of Australia by developing the interior in a way that will induce people to come here in large numbers, and thus provide, in the best of all ways, for our safety. I am not criticising the expenditure on the Federal Capital in any captious spirit. If it could be shown that we could remove to Yass-Canberra with a minimum of expenditure, and be able there to carry out more efficiently the work intrusted to us, I should say by all means let us go there at once. Let us establish the Seat of Government in Sydney, or any other State capital, for fifteen years ; let us do anything that is reasonable, in order that we may escape this immediate expenditure of  &#163;3,500,000.  It is time for us to seriously consider the whole financial position of the Commonwealth. We must look into the future and decide whether, in any circumstances, we should be justified in plunging at once into this reckless and wasteful expenditure of public money. I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland, and regret that the Parliament has not had an opportunity to review the whole financial situation before being called upon to deal with the Works and Buildings Estimates. </para>

              <para>- Certainly ; but the position has become more acute. We can avoid the whole of this proposed expenditure without repudiating the bargain with New South Wales. The cry of &#34; repudiating the compact &#34; is always raised in order to strangle the national consideration of this question; but I have never heard any talk of repudiation, except on the part of some honorable members directly interested in New South Wales. Representatives of the other States donot wish to repudiate the bargain. In the history of Australia, a delay of twenty-five or fifty years in the building of this Capital will be as nothing. </para>

              <para>- We are not building for our own pleasure or convenience, but for the future safety, progress, and comfort ofthe people of the Commonwealth. The Minister&#39;s view is a purely individual and almost a selfish one. This Parliament has cast upon it the duty of building up and perfecting the permanent institutions of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, we, as members of it, should take the same view of the future requirements of the Commonwealth as we do of our own individual pleasure and comfort. The Minister, I am glad to say, has given us a good deal more information than he vouchsafed on this subject on a previous evening. The information we now have gives us an idea of the proposed destination of the money, but it has placed the question in a light in which it was never placed before this House previously. The Minister forecasts an expenditure of  &#163;313,000  immediately. </para>

              <para>- The Minister proposes to start immediately works which will involve that expenditure. Part of the  &#163;66,000  now asked for will be devoted to beginning certain works which once started must be completed. They will involve an eventual cost of  &#163;313,000.  No period is stated, but in the next Estimates, which will be brought down in about six months&#39; time, the rest of that sum is sure to be asked for. The Minister has indicated that this is only the beginning of an undertaking that will cost  . &#163;3,000,000. </para>

He is always quoting America as the pink of perfection in all public institutions, but if helooks up the authorities on the condition of Washington, he will find that it is the &#34; deadest &#34; and least progressive city on the face of the earth. That is the position of the Capital City of a nation of  90,000,000  energetic and progressive people, who have an immense commerce, after being established for over a hundred years. </para>

              <para>- The land fit for settlement immediately surrounding the Capital at Yass-Canberra is valued at about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> an acre on the average. I am not including the ranges in that, but am speaking only of the freehold laud that has been alienated from the Crown. Land of that value, if leased out, will return a very small revenue to the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the Federal Capital has been unfortunately placed in a territory which, under any conditions, cannot be made to yield a large revenue by the leasehold system. It will, therefore, mean all outgoing, to be borne by the people of Australia. The place cannot be made a reproductive business concern. If the United States, with their  90,000,000  people cannot make a progressive commercial city of their capital, how is it possible for the Australian Commonwealth, with 4,500,000 people, to build a capital that will be anything more than an enormous annual drag and drain on its resources for the next hundred years, even in the most favorable circumstances? We ought to bear in mind the enormous financial undertakings in which we have already embarked, and the greatly increased expenditure undertaken by the present Parliament and Government. 1 hope, in view of the great liabilities which we are undertaking, and the greatly increased taxation rendered necessary, that this Parliament will hesitate, apart altogether from State or provincial considerations; before it commits the people of Australia to the enormous expenditure of &#163;3,500,000 on the creation of a Federal Capital. </para>

To prove it, he made reference to the transcontinental railway and the Northern Territory, but the very people who are accusing the Government of heaping up expenditure in connexion with those matters cry out with the same breath about the great necessity for going on with those great national works. </para>

              <para>- I know the honorable member made a further explanation of his statement, but we hear and read almost daily accusations against the Government of increasing the expendi ture. While the expenditure has gone up, and must necessarily go up, great works are now being undertaken in Australia which have never been faced in the past. If this is to be a great country, and we are to have an adequate system of defence, projects like the transcontinental railway and the development of the Northern Territory cannot be lost sight of. I recognise those to be necessary works, and, therefore, we should go on with them, but that is all the more reason, as the honorable member for Wimmera said, why we should cut down expenditure on unnecessary works, of which the building of the Federal Capital is one. While we are blessed with bountiful seasons now, there may be droughts and bad times ahead of us. That is no reason why we should not go on with necessary works, but it is a very good reason for not embarking upon unnecessary works. When last I spoke on the question of the Capital site I condemned the site itself and its water supply, mostly, I admit, upon hearsay, as did a number of other members who had not had the opportunity of seeing the place. Since then I have been to the site, and seen it for myself, 1 am prepared to admit that it is a much better place than I previously thought, and the water supply is much better than a great many honorable members here thought it was. In fact, it exceeded my anticipations altogether. I was rather agreeably surprised with what I saw at the site in regard to the water supply and the scenery - I recognise that I saw it at the best time of the year - yet I am consistent in still opposing the expenditure of any further public money on works at Yass-Canberra. My action on previous occasions was not based solely on the ground of any demerits, of the site, but* was rather directed against the expenditure of public money upon a work which could be set -aside for the next quarter of a century. </para>

              <para>- There isgreat anxiety on the part of certain honorable members to obey the Constitution when it suits them, but the Constitution does not demand that immediate steps should be taken to build the Capital City. I should like the Minister of Home Affairs to supply us with information as to the sums now spent in renting public buildings. If we knew what we are now paying in rent, we might compare that with the probable cost  of establishing the Capital at YassCanberra, and the removal to the Federal City might prove a businesslike arrangement. I hope that before the debate concludes the Minister will give us the figures needed for the comparison I suggest. They might obviate a lot of criticism. Whenever a Victorian representative speaks on this subject, he is told by the representatives of New South Wales that his views are parochial, but personallyI should be quite ready to have alternative meetings of Parliament in Melbourne and Sydney, or any of the other State capitals. The sum of &#163;20,000 is to be spent, the Minister tells us, on power plant, &#163;140,000 on water supply mains, pumping works, &#38;c., and &#163;40,000 on a pipe bridge over the Murrumbidgee. Much of this expenditure would be unnecessary were not the Capital site so remote from a water supply. I understand that the water that is needed will have to be raised 800 ft. by means of pumps driven electrically from a power-house at Yarralumbla, and then conveyed thirteen or fourteen miles. </para>

              <para>- Mains would cost less if the water had not to be conveyed so great a distance. The Minister tells us that we are committing ourselves to an expenditure of &#163;3,000,000. We are not asked to vote that sum right away - it is being asked for piecemeal - but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that we are committing ourselves to the whole expenditure. I shall not now criticise the site that has been selected. All that can be said hasbeen said on that subject. New South Wales members seem to want to have the thing settled. They are in favour of the expenditure of large sums at YassCanberra, so that in future the country cannot draw back. Apparently Sydney representatives in the Parliament of New South Wales are afraid that otherwise a rival to Sydney will spring up. The electors of Australia, however, are not demanding this expenditure, and the Constitution does not say it must be made at once. I think that there is no hurry, and the Minister will not lose kudos by delay. Although times are good now, they may be bad in the near future. There are large developmental works which we must undertake, and unnecessary works can wait. More good could be done by spending this proposed sum of &#163;313,000 in improving our telephone system, and extend ing conveniences to the country districts than by carrying out works at YassCanberra. The contract with New South Wales embodied in the Constitution cannot be set aside, but I hope that the carrying of it out will be deferred for some years. </para>

            <para>. -The Minister hastold us that in voting for the item under discussion we shall be committing ourselves to an expenditure of nearly &#163;400,000. He enumerated a number of proposals, but gave no information as to the need for them, nor did he tell us whether plans and specifications have been prepared. I think Parliament should consider immediately the advisability of creating a Public Works Committee such as they have in New South Wales and Victoria, to which large proposals of this kind would be referred. While surpluses were being returned to the States, there was a check on our public works expenditure, and there was not so much need for the investigation of Ministerial proposals by a Committee. But the public works expenditure of the Commonwealth is now attaining such proportions that it is our bounden duty to prepare for its careful scrutiny. In New South Wales every work estimated to cost &#163;20,000 or more must be inquired into and reported on by the Public Works Committee, and the report of the Committee must be considered by Parliament. The works referred to by the Minister of Home Affairs would, under the New South Wales law, nearly all have to go before the Public Works Committee, and it is not fair to ask us to commit ourselves to them without giving us any information regarding them. I opposed the building of a Federal Capital at the present time, thinking it twenty or tweny-five years too soon. We might very well have put up a building in the National Park, at Sydney, and sat in Melbourne and Sydney for alternate10year periods. </para>

              <para>- Then, I feel so strongly that I shall take the course of submitting a motion in the House affirming that a Public Works Committee should be appointed. We are faced with enormous expenditure in the case of the overland railway and the Northern Territory, if the latter is to cease to be a mill-stone round our necks, and become reproductive. It is too much to ask any Minister or Department to deal with large expenditure of the kind without the assistance of some such body as I suggest, and such as can be found in operation in some of the States. We are asked to vote lump sums without any official reports or other information as to details ; and I am sure there is not a business man in the community who would permit such a method in his own affairs. The sooner we realize the seriousness of the position, andappoint a Public Works Committee, the better it will be for Australia. </para>

I looked on the Minister of Home Affairs as a business man ; but the manner in which he placed the Estimates Before us the other night inclines me to waver in my loyalty to that ideal. I have had some experiencein drawing up estimates; and I know that it is necessary, not only to show all the details, but to give reasons for the details. Here we are simply asked to vote &#163;100,000 in order to build a city in the bush. Lastyear, when we voted the &#163;50,000, some details were given. </para>

              <para>- Had details been given the other night, a great deal of time would have been saved. It is only when the Minister finds himself, as it were, in a hole, that he lays before us information which shows an expenditure, not of &#163;100,000, but of &#163;313,000. It is false economy to ask for only &#163;100,000 if a larger sum be necessary, because to fall short of funds at a particular period of construction might largely increase the ultimate cost. It is stated that the Federal Capital will cost &#163;3,000,000, but I think the figure will prove to be much higher. When, a little time ago, we asked for some consideration to be shown to the members of our Military Forces, we were told that the finances would not permit of it ; and yet we are asked to vote this large sum for the purposes of a Federal Capital. I feel quite sure that if the question were submitted to the country, every State but that of New South Wales would vote against the establishment of this city. The population of Australia is only a little over 4,000,000; and yet it is proposed to have another capital. It is true that in the United States there is a Federal Capital, but it is purely a political city - practically dead commercially - and there are 103,000,000 people to share the cost. As pointed out by the honorable member for Wimmera, we are faced with expenditure in other directions amounting to &#163;14,000,000; and yet the handful of people here are to be asked to provide another &#163;3,000,000 for this unnecessary undertaking. It seems strange that the Labour party, which aims at high ideals, cannot see its way clear to pay the individuals who are the producing workers of the country sufficient to bring their families up in comfort, and that the Government, at the same time, should ask us to pass the vote under discussion. The whole position is absurd. I understand that there are Public Works Committees in some of the States which do very valuable work, and the creation of such a body for the Commonwealth would relieve Ministers of great responsibility. With a Public Works Committee to inform and advise him, the Minister of Home Affairs would not find himself in the predicament of the other night, when he was absolutely unable to reply to the criticism levelled at him. </para>

            <para>. - I regard it as irrevocably settled that we shall have a Federal Capital, but I submit that the proposed expenditure is absolutely in  defiance of the desire of the important constituency I represent. It is, therefore, my intention to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland, and I, perhaps, should do all that is necessary if I said &#34;ditto&#34; to what has already been advanced in favour of that proposal. There is, however, one aspect that has not yet been dealt with. It is the determination, I understand, that this city shall be a model one in every respect, and to that end competitive designs have been invited. We are now asked, however, to vote money for certain works, and we are not told whether these will dovetail in with the plans as ultimately adopted. It appears to rae that, in carrying out works at this stage, we run the risk of having to undo them when the plans for the city are adopted. That is not a fair position in which to place the country and Parliament. Before a penny is spent in any permanent work, the whole scheme and design should have been settled. I, for one, have not that faith in the Minister of Home Affairs that he has in himself. Perhaps that is only reasonable. Certainly, even if he be the only banker in Australia, I do not think he can claim to be the only architect in the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- Then the honorable member will do well to proceed along the lines I have indicated before incurring this expenditure. Having called for competitive designs, let him submit to a competent authority those sent in. I may say, in passing, that I doubt whether the honorable member himself is a competent authority in this regard. Let the designs be finally submitted for adoption by this Parliament, and that having been done, let every expenditure incurred be an expenditure towards carrying out the accepted designs. If that course be followed, the country will be benefited, and a great deal of heavy expenditure will be put off, as it should be, for a term of years, in accordance with the needs of the Commonwealth, and until our population is considerably augmented. If the Minister and the honorable member for Parramatta could be induced to view this matter in a proper light, I am sure that they would vote for the amendment. Having entered my protest, I hope that we  shall  proceed to a division, and I am confident that, if honorable members vote in accordance with their convictions and with due regard to the desires of the people, the result of the division will be such as will prevent this threatened outrage, and ward off the heavy demand that is being made under this heading upon the public Treasury. </para>

            <para>.- During the last few minutes I have been picturing in my mind the honorable member for Parramatta in - his best form denouncing a scheme or proposal with which he does not agree. I could well imagine the honorable member, if this proposal did not relate to New South Wales, displaying his best book-and-table-thumping style in condemnation of it. I am sure that, in such circumstances, the Minister would have received at his hands such a castigation for his lack of information concerning this item as he had never previously experienced. </para>

              <para>- It was said of some one of old, &#34; I leave him to his idols,&#34; and I may say at once that I leave the honorable member for Parramatta riveted very strongly to his parochialism. I do not wish to repeat what has already been so well said by the honorable member for Wimmera and the honorable member for Indi, but I think the present is a splendid opportunity to peer into the future. Notwithstanding  the Estimates of the Treasurer, I believe that we are not likely to have, during 191 1 -12, such a rosy time as we experienced during 1910-11. </para>

              <para>- I am not going to say that there is a boom, but I think that the honorable member will agree with me that some of our chief lines of production will be considerably less than was the case last year. A decreased production means decreased revenue, and consequently a lessening of the funds available for desirable works. We need somewhat to husband our resources, but if we are going to spend on wasteful schemes a hundred thousand pounds here and another hundred thousand pounds there, the national exchequer will suffer seriously. I agree with the honorable member for Franklin that the proposals, as outlined by the Minister of Home Affairs, in regard to the Capital site are absolutely alarming. The Minister pleads that portion of the &#163;100,000 which we are asked to vote is a re-vote, but we have to remember that that expenditure is to go on developing, according to the honorable gentleman, until it reaches &#163;313,000, which, in turn, will develop into an expenditure of &#163;3,000,000. </para>

The honorable member for Wimmera, and one or two others, accused this Government of having enormously increased the expenditure of the Commonwealth, but I would remind them that that expenditure relates chiefly to work sanctioned by previous Governments and Parliaments. The Minister of Home Affairs has told us that the erection of a power plant and necessary- buildings at the Federal Capital will cost &#163;20,000. To what plant does he refer? </para>

              <para>- As was pointed out when the Estimates were before us last year,a pumping scheme means a constant expenditure, and the result obtained from it is not nearly so satisfactory as that secured from a gravitation scheme. In company with a number of honorable members, I paid a visit to Yass-Canberra some little time ago, and we were fortunate in experiencing a couple of those delightful Australian days which make a man feel glad that he belongs to Australia, and not to. the misty climes where the sun is rarely seen, and the faces of the people are not often illumined by a smile. Our visit was preceded by an extensive rainfall, and I noticed that the volume of water passing down the Cotter River, from which the water supply for the Federal Capital is to be drawn, amounted to 160,000,000 gallons for twenty-four hours. On analyzing the figures before leaving camp, however, I found that the volume of water passing down the river on some days during the preceding twelve months had been as low as 4,000,000 gallons for twenty-four hours. There is a remarkable variation in the flow, and if that part of New South Wales has had recently an experience similar to that which has befallen other parts of the State, there is probably very little water running down the stream to-day. I object to the site because of the enormous expenditure that will be necessary to provide there what we know as the ordinary modern conveniences. I have no desire to deal with this question from a parochial stand-point. My only regret is that a better site has not been selected within that magnificent portion of Australia known as New South Wales. I understand that we shall not be allowed to draw any water from the Murrumbidgee. </para>

              <para>- A good water supply can be got from it, if it is tapped high up. I objected last year, and object again now, to the pumping scheme. It is not right to put the country to that great expenditure simply for water-supply purposes. We have first to clam back the Cotter, and then from that dam to pump the water up to the top of a hill 800 feet higher, and carry it from the reservoir there across the Murrumbidgee river in pipes ; and thence into the Capital. The scheme, now that I have seen it, strikes me as even more &#39; &#39; wild-cat &#39; &#39; than I thought it before. I admit that it is beautiful water. I understand that when Victoria comes into her own, the country south of the Murrumbidgee will pass into her possession, and then the water supply of the Federal Capital will come within her territory. Unfortunately, it appears that we are to be committed to a great expenditure on the Capital site ; and I believe that, as the years go by, and increasing amounts are asked for to carry out this great scheme, Parliament will become more and more doubtful of its wisdom, until, probably, it will refuse to vote further money for the purpose. If we happen to strike a few bad seasons, any Government that goes on expending money on this site will be doing what, to my mind, will be criminal. It must be remembered, in regard to the water-supply scheme, that when a stream like the Cotter is dammed back, and millions of gallons of water are stored in the dam, underneath the surface of that water, as a rule, a large amount of vegetable matter accumulates. That is sure to happen in this case, and considerable trouble will be caused by it. Instead of having a live running stream, the water coming in will just flow over the surface, and over the top of the weir, while the water underneath, which will be taken to supply the city, will be almost dead water, adversely affected by a great deal of vegetable matter, and, perhaps, not conducive to public health. Instead of having a real live gravitation stream from a pure source into a dam immediately outside the Federal Capital, we shall be, unfortunately, troubled with a bad water supply. Firstly, therefore, we shall have a somewhat deficient supply of water as compared with what we might have had at other sites ; and secondly, we shall be put to a great amount of expense in order to get the water to the city. I hope that the bridge which is to carry the water across the Murrumbidgee will be used for general traffic also. </para>

              <para>- That will make the expenditure on the bridge a little more justifiable. The works proposed involve an exceptionally big expenditure. The weir is to cost &#163;30,000; the mains and pipe head, &#38;c, will run into &#163;140,000; the bridge over the Murrumbidgee will cost &#163;40,000 ; the temporary railway from Queanbeyan to the Capital site will cost &#163;25,000 ; road-making and deviations, &#163;10,000 ; offices at Acton and afforestation, &#163;13,000 ; and joinery timber, &#163;5,000. With regard to the latter items, I expected, after hearing the delightful picture presented to the House by the Minister on the last occasion, to see a number of trees fairly well advanced at Yass-Canberra. </para>

              <para>- The other land could be given away. On seeing that country, I thought that the words used in the New South Wales Legislative Council, to the effect that the Federation could have this territory, as it was of no good to the State, were very true. What timber is growing there is very .stunted. When there, I saw a. bridge being built across the so-called Molonglo river, which we called a creek. I learnt from the men engaged on the work that the timber they were using did not come from the neighbourhood, but was brought from a place a long way outside the confines of the Territory. It was not timber of extra size, and there were no difficulties about the work. It was simply an ordinary bridge to span a mere creek. That incident proved conclusively to me that there was in the Territory a dearth of the materials necessary for building even an &#39;ordinary town. The Minister is also going to spend a considerable sum on brick-making. If the Government cannot make better bricks there when their machinery is erected than those which , I saw being used in erecting what I understood were to be permanent buildings on the Acton Estate, I am sorry for the buildings that will be put up there. I do not think I ever handled worse bricks in my life. Those were newly-made bricks when I was there two or three months ago. </para>

              <para>- In the case of the bricks I saw and handled at the Federal Capital site, one could take off the corners with finger and thumb. I had made complaints before in regard to the deficiencies of the selected Capital site, and so I wanted, by my own personal observation, to rectify any mistakes I had made or to justify my statements. I admit that I saw the Cotter river under charming conditions, which left an impression which is hard to remove ; but, at the same time, I find from the figures that the flow of 160,000,000 gallons a day is often reduced to 4,000,000 gallons.

              <para>- Yes, but there must be places in New South Wales free from fogs such as are prevalent during the winter at Canberra. When I was there I hardly slept for the cold, although well covered with blankets. This is a very serious question, because we are embarking on an expenditure of many millions. While the revenue is what it is, the expenditure may not be much felt, but the day will come when it will cause great inconvenience. I do not know whether I shall again raise my voice against this project. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, and the hope of the reversal of the decision regarding the Capital has made my heart very sick indeed. Were the compositionof this Parliament the same as that of earlier Parliaments, we should not now be voting money for expenditure at Yass- Canberra. There is no reason why we should not make a change of site even now. It is always best to turn back when warned of certain evil. I hope that in the interests of Australia the reduction proposed by the honorable member for Gippsland will be carried as an intimation to the Minister not to proceed further with this expenditure. </para>

            <para>A motion brought forward by Colonel Ryrie, calling for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the pay and allowances of warrant and non-commissioned officers and men of the Permanent Forces, next came up for consideration. An excellent case was made out for the inquiry by members on both sides of the House, but the motion was talked out by the Labour party. </para>

            <para>.- It is only fair to say that the object of the honorable member for North Sydney in objecting to the honorable member for Nepean continuing his speech on another occasion was to have a vote taken immediately on the motion. The honorable member for Nepean, in the course of his remarks in the same connexion, was good enough to say that the responsibility for the wiping cut of the motion lay with the honorable member for North Sydney and myself. </para>

              <para>- No. I thought honorable members opposite had ample opportunity to discuss the motion during the two and a half hours that it was under consideration. I wished a vote to be taken, and believed that what occurred in connexion with the motion for the abolition of the parliamentary refreshment bar would follow my action in this case. It will be remembered that the honorable member for Brisbane, who submitted that motion, asked leave to continue his remarks at a later date, and that when leave was refused the House immediately proceeded to a division. In the circumstances I thought that my objecting to the honorable member for Nepean having leave to continue his remarks on the motion which I had submitted, I should. also be able to secure an immediate division. When I found that he was going on with his speech, I said at once that I would agree to the necessary leave being granted, but the honorable member&#39;s reply was, &#34; No. The honorable member refused to grant me leave when I asked for it.&#34; I absolutely repudiate the imputation that it was my fault that a division was not taken on the motion last evening. </para>
